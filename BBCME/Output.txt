03/02/2024 02:04:00	Why did US wait to retaliate for drone attack on its troops? - BBC News	Nearly a week after a drone strike in Jordan killed three US soldiers, retaliatory strikes against Iran-backed militias have begun. The strikes had been expected for several days, and in the interim, the Biden administration began to face questions and criticism from Republicans about the timing and forcefulness of the US response. But foreign policy experts believed the approach allowed Iran to withdraw personnel, potentially avoiding a wider conflict between the US and Iran."This would allow them to degrade the capacity of these Iranian-backed militias to attack US forces, but not escalate," Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East, told the BBC. "Although it is likely not going to be a deterrent to future attacks." The ultimate benefit, he said, would be "to avoid a direct war" between the US and Iran. The US struck the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force and affiliated militias in Iraq and Syria, at seven sites in total. Bombers hit 85 individual targets, according to US defence officials."Let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond," President Joe Biden said.US officials have blamed an Iranian-backed militia group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, for the Jordan attack. The organisation - an umbrella group of multiple militias - is believed to have been armed, funded and trained by Iran.Iran has denied any involvement in the drone strike, which also injured 41 US troops.Defence and security officials said that weather had made it difficult to retaliate sooner, with Friday presenting the best conditions for launching strikes.Though the White House and Pentagon also repeatedly said they were avoiding "telegraphing" operations in the days leading up to the strikes, experts believe they did just that - with the ultimate intention of avoiding a wider war with Iran. Arabian Gulf States Institute of Washington fellow Hussein Ibish, said the delay appeared to be the US signalling "what they're not going to do, which is strike inside Iran".Mr Mulroy told the BBC it is possible that the US allowed Iranian Revolutionary Guard personnel "to leave the facilities that are going to be struck".Experts noted the US must walk a fine line between deterring a country like Iran without igniting a greater conflict. "Telegraphing" the strikes could allow the US to adopt a "Goldilocks" approach to the operation that is "not too hard and not too soft", said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Washington DC-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies.That approach "would inflict pain on our adversaries so they stop attacking our forces, but not so much that they feel a need for a massive escalation, thereby avoiding a regional war". National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Friday that Washington won't "telegraph future operations" but confirmed "there will be additional response action taken in coming days".However, Republicans in Congress have been quick to condemn Mr Biden's approach for being too lenient on Iran. Speaker Mike Johnson, the most powerful Republican in Congress, said after the attacks that "public handwringing and excessive signalling undercuts our ability to put a decisive end to the barrage of attacks endured over the past few months".In a post on X, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas called Mr Biden's response "anaemic" and claimed "it has only emboldened the ayatollahs further.""Only further, more devastating attacks against Iranian forces will scare the ayatollahs," he wrote.Senator Markwayne Mullin invoked the more aggressive actions of past Republican presidents, Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, as a contrast to Mr Biden's plan of attack."Deterrence isn't delayed half-measures," he wrote on X. "Deterrence is taking the head off the snake."But Mr Ibish noted that the Biden administration may be trying to avoid domestic political pitfalls that would come with the US getting dragged into a more serious conflict."If they did strike in Iran, the Republican standard bearers like Donald Trump would denounce Biden for being a warmonger," he said. "It's a political trap. Everybody gets that, so they're not going to fall into that trap."

Critics have argued that the strikes should have occurred earlier.A statement from US Central Command (Centcom) said the attack occurred at 16:00EST (21:00GMT) - which is about midnight local time in the region. Forces used numerous aircraft, including B-1 "long-range bombers flown from [the] United States" to hit a total of 85 targets at seven sites.More than 125 precision munitions were used, the statement said.US General Douglas Sims said the B-1 bombers "flew a single nonstop route from the US" and were able to "gas and go" while travelling in the air.He added that the US is "pretty confident" that the locations struck were "pretty significant in degrading capability"."We will know better in terms of what [the assessment] looks like tomorrow," Gen Sims said.US officials have blamed an Iranian-backed militia group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, for the attack and say the one-way drone was Iranian-made and similar to the ones being supplied to Russia.The militant organisation - an umbrella group of multiple militias - is believed to have been armed, funded and trained by the IRGC.Seven locations were hit  - four in Syria and three in Iraq - over 30 minutes.The facilities struck included command and control operations and munition supply chain facilities of "militia groups and their IRGC sponsors who facilitated attacks against US and coalition forces", the Pentagon added. Also targeted were logistics hubs and drone storage units.According to reports by AFP news agency, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said at least 13 pro-Iran fighters were killed in eastern Syria. There were no strikes on Iranian soil and an Iranian warship in the Red Sea, thought to be involved in helping direct Houthi attacks on commercial shipping, was not targeted.In a statement issued by the White House, Mr Biden said his country "does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world".But, he warned, "let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond". The attacks came several hours after Mr Biden attended a repatriation ceremony for the remains of William Rivers, 46, Kennedy Sanders, 24, and Breonna Moffett, 23.More than 40 other service members were injured in the same drone attack, which struck Tower 22 - a US base in north-eastern Jordan.Republicans criticised the timing, saying that the wait was too long.  US officials have said any delay was due to cloudy weather obstructing targets.Florida Republican Congressman Byron Donalds, speaking to Fox News after the US attack, said "these strikes should have occurred later on that same day when our service members were killed."After the attack, White House National Security Spokesman John Kirby said the US has had no communications with Iran since 28 January - the day the drone attack occurred.Iran has denied any role in the Tower 22 attack."No threat will be left unanswered," Revolutionary Guards commander Major General Hossein Salami, who advises Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Wednesday, before the US retaliation began.His remarks came a day after Amir Saeed Iravani, Iran's ambassador to the UN, told Iranian journalists in New York that Tehran would "decisively respond" to any attack on the country, according to the state-run Irna news agency.Experts believe that the nearly-one week delay was intended to allow Iran to withdraw personnel, potentially avoiding a wider conflict. "If you know you're a target, you simply disappear," one Iraqi official told BBC News.One possible response by Iran could resemble what occurred in the days after the US assassination of the IRGC general Qasem Soleimani.Five days after the assassination, Iran fired volleys of ballistic missiles at US bases in Syria, after giving the US several hours' notice.With reporting by Bernd Debusmann, Jonathan Beale, Hugo Bachega	
03/02/2024 00:10:00	Confronting the Houthis: How powerful are Yemen’s rebel rulers? - BBC News	The Houthis continue to confound some of the world's most powerful militaries. They are still firing missiles at any international shipping they consider linked to the US, UK or Israel, as well as some that isn't.They have already had a major impact on global trade, forcing ships to divert thousands of miles away. They seem undaunted by repeated US-led airstrikes on their missile bases and they have vowed to retaliate against US and UK assets.So just who are the Houthis, how did they get so powerful and what happens now in the Red Sea?The Houthis are a minority group of Yemenis from the mountainous northwest of the country. They take their name from their movement's founder, Hussein Al-Houthi. They fought several wars against Yemen's strongman ruler in the early 2000s and then, after he was deposed by the Arab Spring protests, they marched down to the capital, Sana'a, and seized power in 2014. The previously deposed President Saleh, still bitter at being ousted, put his loyal Republican Guard at their disposal, enabling them to take over 80 per cent of Yemen's population.The Houthis then promptly assassinated him.Since the Houthis seized power Yemen, already the poorest Arab nation, has been torn apart by a catastrophic civil war.An estimated 150,000 people have been killed, along with millions made dependant on food aid. For seven years the Houthis survived a massive and ultimately fruitless coalition air campaign to oust them, led by the Saudis who were alarmed at the Houthis' links to their arch-rival, Iran."The Houthis embody a triumphant mindset, forged through a series of victories over two decades", says Mohammed Al-Basha, a Middle East expert with the Virginia-based consultancy Navanti."Demonstrating resilience from 2015 to 2022, they effectively thwarted the Saudi-led coalition's attempt to reinstate the internationally recognised government in Sana'a."From mid-November 2023 onwards, the Houthis have used their substantial arsenal of missiles and drones to target shipping passing close to the narrow, strategic chokepoint of the Bab Al-Mandeb Strait.Their stated aim was to attack any vessel with Israeli links, in support of Hamas, vowing to continue their attacks until Israel ends its own assault on Gaza. When US and British warships came to the defence of container vessels steaming past Yemen's Red Sea coast the Houthis directed their attacks on the warships, at one point losing three of their speedboats and 10 sailors in a one-sided engagement with the US Navy.Despite that loss, attacking the US Navy and Royal Navy, says Mohammed Al-Basha, "underscores the Houthis' prevailing sense of triumph and fosters euphoric hubris within their ranks.. leading some members of the group to perceive divine intervention and a historic alignment in their favour."The Houthis - most of whom follow the Zaidi branch of Shia Islam in Sunni-majority Yemen - represent only around 15 per cent of Yemenis yet they consider themselves the rightful rulers. So how do they differ from the rest of the population?"They are generally more war-like, violent and cruel" says Edmund Fitton-Brown, who was UK ambassador to Yemen from 2015-17. "I encountered astonishing instances of brutality in Aden and Ta'izz. The Houthis consider themselves an elite from an elite (the Zaidi sect). Some of their casual viciousness towards Sunni civilians in central and southern Yemen has been remarkable: a readiness to deploy snipers and kill non-combatants for fun."There has long been a concerted effort, led by the UN, to end Yemen's civil war and the Saudis, who host the legitimate but ousted Yemeni government, have concluded a fragile truce with the Houthis.Edmund Fitton-Brown had some experience of dealing with them in negotiations. "It was extremely challenging", he says. "They were difficult, hostile, capricious, prone to tantrums, late arrivals and walkouts. They insisted on VIP treatment and a ready supply of qat [a narcotic leaf chewed by many Yemenis]. During peace talks they drove their Kuwaiti hosts mad with frustration."Since the Houthis began their attacks on shipping, and the US and UK responded with air strikes on their missile bases, there have been vast, government-sanctioned protests against the West in the capital. So how genuine are they?"By opposing what many in the population of northern Yemen perceive as foreign forces, including the US, UK and the Saudi-led coalition, and directly confronting Israel in support of Gaza" says Al-Basha, "the Houthis have gained popularity."He adds however, that present-day Yemen remains a divided nation, with anti-Houthi resistance persisting in pockets of north-eastern Yemen, Ma'rib, Tai'izz and the southern governates. It appears unlikely the Houthis could emerge victorious in a "free and fair election". As to the protests, Fitton-Brown says the Houthis bring out mobs on the street through fear. "They call a demonstration, make it a holiday from work, make it clear that attendance is expected. Many of their personnel were recruited because they were unemployed and desperate to earn a wage. In areas outside their control they are loathed."And meanwhile the missiles keep coming.The Houthis seem to have an almost inexhaustible supply of drones and other munitions to launch at shipping, much of it supplied by Iran with parts smuggled in at sea in small boats or across the desert border with Oman.Doubtfully with the Houthis capitulating. "They won't want to lose face" says Fitton-Brown. "But [if a ceasefire occurred in Gaza] they may seize an opportunity to declare victory, claiming that they have achieved their objectives. If Iran becomes concerned that Houthi actions are putting the Islamic Republic at risk they have enough influence to make the Houthis look for a way out."So for now, the situation in the southern Red Sea is a standoff. The Houthis are not backing down under military pressure, despite seeing one after another of their missile launch sites destroyed by US-led airstrikes. They clearly have plenty more in their arsenal and the indications are they are looking to raise the stakes by preparing surface-to-air missile sites with a view to shooting down a western warplane. The southern Red Sea and adjacent Gulf of Aden will remain a dangerous part of the world for the foreseeable future.	
02/02/2024 21:20:00	US sanctions Iranian officials over cyber-attacks on water plants - BBC News	The US has imposed sanctions on six officials in Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which it says are responsible for the cyber-attacks on American water plants late last year. This comes as the US prepares its response to the drone attack that killed three US soldiers in Jordan, close to the Syrian border, on Sunday. The US has said an Iranian-backed militia group is responsible for that attack. "The deliberate targeting of critical infrastructure by Iranian cyber actors is an unconscionable and dangerous act," said Brian Nelson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, in the announcement.  The sanctioned individuals are part of the IRGC's Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC), and include Hamid Reza Lashgarian, the head of the cyber organisation, and also a commander in the IRGC-Quds Force. The Quds Force is Iran's shadowy overseas operations arm, which the US accuses of being responsible for attacks in the Middle East. Mr Nelson added that "the United States will not tolerate such actions and will use the full range of our tools and authorities to hold the perpetrators to account".  The US Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) calls America's water systems that residents rely on to drink clean water 'target-rich, cyber-poor'."It's why Cisa moves with such urgency," said the agency's executive assistant director for cyber-security, Eric Goldstein, in an interview with the BBC.He said there could be "a hypothetical scenario where [the cyber-attacks] had life-safety impact and affected the potability of water". Late last year, a group named Cyber Av3ngers affiliated with the IRGC targeted the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa, in western Pennsylvania, along with several other water systems. These facilities' use of technology manufactured by Unitronics, an Israeli company, made them unsuspecting targets.  The cyber group posted an image on compromised screens with their digital calling card, and the words "down with Israel".  "If you told me to list 10 things that would go wrong with our water authority, this would not be on the list," Matthew Mottes, the chairman of the authority, told the BBC's US partner CBS.  According to Cisa, thanks to a simple default password - like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 - the Iranian hackers were able to disable a monitor regulating water pressure, but plant managers were able to take over manually.  It was considered a low-level hacking attempt, but federal officials are concerned that these attacks are not only ramping up but are also exposing how vulnerable America's water systems are. "Many water utilities likely didn't know they were running a default password," said Mr Goldstein. Following the attacks, Pennsylvania Senators Bob Casey and John Fetterman, and Congressman Chris Deluzio sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland urging "the Department of Justice to conduct a full investigation and hold those responsible accountable". In a statement to the BBC, Mr  Deluzio's office said: "No-one expects to be in the crosshairs of a war in the Middle East, but in this day and age, cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare can occur anywhere - and everyone has to be prepared." Cisa has warned there are several countries that are exploiting this lack of cyber-security awareness. "Iranians cyber actors continue to mature and invest in their capabilities. China is the pacing threat that the US faces in cyberspace; there is malicious Russian activity, but North Korea and Iran continue to invest in their capabilities," Mr Goldstein told the BBC,	
02/02/2024 17:15:00	Turkey Israel: 'Seven arrested for passing information to Mossad' - BBC News	Turkish security forces have arrested seven people on suspicion of passing information to the Israeli intelligence service Mossad, unnamed officials say.The arrests came after a joint raid by police and officials from Turkey's MIT intelligence agency in Istanbul and the western city of Izmir.A month ago 34 people with suspected Mossad links were charged with spying.Turkey's president has warned Israel of "serious consequences" if it targets Hamas members on Turkish soil. Turkey - unlike most Western countries and some Arab states - does not classify Hamas as a terrorist organisation.There is strong support for the Palestinians in Turkey, with tens of thousands regularly attending rallies in Istanbul and other cities.Ankara has as not yet made a formal statement about Friday's arrests.But media reports via unnamed officials say MIT discovered that Mossad was using private detectives to monitor, photograph and track suspected Hamas members.In January Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said the 34 detainees were charged with "political or military espionage" on behalf of Israeli intelligence.Mossad is believed to have recruited Palestinians and Syrian nationals living in Turkey as part of its operations.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been involved in an increasingly bitter war of words with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since Israel's war with Hamas began.He has described Mr Netanyahu's actions in Gaza as "genocide" and last month compared him to Hitler.Israeli intelligence officials have vowed to target Hamas outside the Palestinian territories, including in Lebanon, Qatar and Turkey.Israel launched its war against the Islamist group after its fighters crossed into Israel on 7 October and carried out a series of deadly attacks which led to the deaths of about 1,300 people.Some 250 people were taken back to Gaza as hostages - with 105 subsequently released during a truce in November.	
02/02/2024 12:56:00	Western officials in protest over Israel Gaza policy - BBC News	More than 800 serving officials in the US and Europe have signed a statement warning that their own governments' policies on the Israel-Gaza war could amount to "grave violations of international law".The "transatlantic statement", a copy of which was passed to the BBC, says their administrations risk being complicit in "one of the worst human catastrophes of this century" but that their expert advice has been sidelined. It is the latest sign of significant levels of dissent within the governments of some of Israel's key Western allies.One signatory to the statement, a US government official with more than 25 years' national security experience, told the BBC of the "continued dismissal" of their concerns."The voices of those who understand the region and the dynamics were not listened to," said the official."What's really different here is we're not failing to prevent something, we're actively complicit. That is fundamentally different from any other situation I can recall," added the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The statement is signed by civil servants from the US, the EU and 11 European countries including the UK, France and Germany. It says Israel has shown "no boundaries" in its military operations in Gaza, "which has resulted in tens of thousands of preventable civilian deaths; and… the deliberate blocking of aid… putting thousands of civilians at risk of starvation and slow death.""There is a plausible risk that our governments' policies are contributing to grave violations of international law, war crimes and even ethnic cleansing or genocide," it said.The identities of those who signed or endorsed the statement have not been made public and the BBC has not seen a list of names, but understands that nearly half are officials who each have at least a decade of experience in government. One retired US ambassador told the BBC that the coordination by dissenting civil servants in multiple governments was unprecedented."It's unique in my experience watching foreign policy in the last 40 years," said Robert Ford, a former American ambassador to Algeria and Syria. He likened it to concerns within the US administration in 2003 over faulty intelligence leading up to the invasion of Iraq, but said this time many officials with reservations did not want to remain silent. "[Then there were] people who knew better, who knew that intelligence was being cherry-picked, who knew that there wasn't a plan for the day after, but nobody said anything publicly. And that turned out to be a serious problem," he said. "The problems with the Gaza war are so serious and the implications are so serious that they feel compelled to go public," he said. The officials argue the current nature of their governments' military, political or diplomatic support for Israel "without real conditions or accountability" not only risks further Palestinian deaths, but also endangers the lives of hostages held by Hamas, as well as Israel's own security and regional stability. "Israel's military operations have disregarded all important counterterrorism expertise gained since 9/11… the [military] operation has not contributed to Israel's goal of defeating Hamas and has instead strengthened the appeal of Hamas, Hezbollah and other negative actors". The officials say they have expressed their professional concerns internally but have been "overruled by political and ideological considerations". One senior British official who has endorsed the statement told the BBC of "growing disquiet" among civil servants. The official referred to the fallout from last week's preliminary ruling by the UN's International Court of Justice in a case brought by South Africa which required Israel to do all it can to prevent acts of genocide."The dismissal of South Africa's case as 'unhelpful' by our Foreign Secretary puts [the international rules-based] order in peril.""We have heard ministers dismiss allegations against the Israeli Government seemingly without having received proper and well-evidenced legal advice. Our current approach does not appear to be in the best interests of the UK, the region or the global order," said the official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. In response to the statement, the UK Foreign Office said it wanted to see an end to the fighting in Gaza as soon as possible."As the Foreign Secretary says, Israel has committed to act within international humanitarian law and has the ability to do so, but we are also deeply concerned about the impact on the civilian population in Gaza," said a spokesperson. The European Union Commission said it was "looking into" the statement. The US State Department has been approached for comment.The statement suggests that while Israel's military operation has caused unprecedented destruction of lives and property in Gaza, there appears to be no workable strategy to effectively remove Hamas as a threat, nor for a political solution to ensure Israel's security in the longer term. It calls for the US and European governments to "stop asserting to the public that there is a strategic and defensible rationale behind the Israeli operation".  Israeli officials have consistently rejected such criticism. In response to the new statement, the Israeli embassy in London said it was bound by international law.It added: "Israel continues to act against a genocidal terrorist organisation which commits war crimes as well as crimes against humanity."Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed that only full military pressure on Hamas will secure the further release of hostages, while the army says it has destroyed significant underground infrastructure used by the group, including command centres, weapons sites and facilities for holding hostages. On Saturday, the Israeli military said: "Throughout [the city of] Khan Yunis, we have eliminated over 2,000 terrorists above and below ground."Israel has repeatedly rejected claims it deliberately targets civilians, accusing Hamas of hiding in and around civilian infrastructure. Since the start of the war, more than 26,750 Palestinians have been killed and at least 65,000 injured, according to health officials in the Gaza Strip, which has been governed by Hamas and blockaded by Israel and Egypt since 2007. Israeli officials say that 9,000 of those killed were Hamas militants but have not provided evidence for the figure. More than 1,200 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas attacks of October 7th, and a further 100 died of their injuries according to Israeli officials. More than 250 people were taken as hostages into Gaza. The US administration has repeatedly said that "far too many Palestinians have been killed" in Gaza, and that Israel has the right to ensure October 7th "can never happen again". 	
02/02/2024 00:06:00	US approves plan to strike Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, officials say - BBC News	The US has approved plans for a series of strikes on Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, officials have told the BBC's US partner CBS News.The strikes will take place over a number of days, officials said, and weather conditions will likely dictate when they are launched.It comes after a drone attack killed three US soldiers in Jordan, close to the Syrian border, on Sunday.The US blamed an Iranian-backed militia group for that attack.That group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, is believed to contain multiple militias that have been armed, funded and trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guards force. It has said it was responsible for Sunday's strike. Iran, meanwhile, has denied any role in the attack which injured 41 other US troops at the military base, known as Tower 22. US officials have said that US intelligence believes that the drone used to attack the facility was manufactured by Iran - and is similar to the drones Iran has been sending to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. At a news conference on Thursday, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin defended the delayed military response, saying: "We will respond where we choose, when we choose and how we choose.""I think everyone recognises the challenge associated with making sure that we hold the right people accountable," he said, adding that there is no "set formula for doing this"."There are ways to manage this so it doesn't spiral out of control. And that's been our focus throughout," Mr Austin continued.The officials who spoke to CBS News did not give an exact timeline on the potential strikes. They said the US military could launch them in bad weather, but preferred to have better visibility to reduce the risk of inadvertently hitting civilians.President Joe Biden has been under mounting pressure from Republican lawmakers, including some of Washington's most hawkish voices on Iran, to strike targets on Iranian soil. But while the US has repeatedly pledged to respond to the drone attack, Mr Biden and other defence officials have said Washington is not seeking a wider war with Iran or an escalation of tensions in the region. "That's not what I'm looking for," Mr Biden told reporters at the White House earlier this week.The reportedly approved plans appear to keep the targeting to Iranian targets Syria and Iraq, rather than inside Iran. Several Iran-backed groups have increased attacks on US and Israeli-linked entities since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October. The Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, for example, have attacked ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, prompting strikes from the US and its allies.A US defence official told CBS that a drone was shot down overnight in the Gulf of Aden, while an unmanned sea drone was struck and destroyed in the Red Sea. Citing unnamed sources, Reuters on Thursday reported that Iran had withdrawn senior officials from Syria following a series of Israeli airstrikes in a bid to avoid being directly drawn into a wider conflict in the region. US officials told CNN this week that there were signs that the Iranian government was becoming increasingly concerned about the actions of its proxy groups in the region, who have launched over 160 attacks on US forces since October. The bodies of the three US soldiers killed in the attack in Jordan are expected to be repatriated to a Delaware Air Force base on Friday. The White House has announced that President Biden will attend. The three soldiers have been named as William Jerome Rivers, 46, Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, and Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23. All three were part of an army reserve unit based in Fort Moore, Georgia. 	
01/02/2024 22:48:00	US sanctions Israeli settlers over West Bank violence - BBC News	US President Joe Biden has approved sanctions on four Israeli settlers accused of attacking Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.Mr Biden signed a broad executive order, saying violence in the West Bank had reached "intolerable levels".The sanctions block the individuals from accessing all US property, assets and the American financial system.Violence in the West Bank has spiked since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October.Some 370 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since then, according to the UN. The majority of those have been killed by Israeli forces but at least eight of them have been killed by Israeli settlers, the UN said.The new executive order means the US government has the power to sanction any foreign nationals who attack, intimidate or seize the property of Palestinians.The sanctions are a first by the US administration - a rare step targeting Israelis - and comes as Mr Biden travels to the state of Michigan, which has a large Arab-American population that has been critical of his support for Israel.The Arab American Institute, an advocacy group, earlier said that since the start of the conflict, support by Arab Americans for the Democratic Party has plummeted from 59% in 2020 to just 17%.On Thursday, a senior official in the Biden administration said the president had repeatedly raised concerns with Israel about violence by settlers.The executive order sets out the groundwork for how the US will respond to further attacks in the West Bank, and is an escalation compared to the visa restrictions it imposed on some individuals last year."The situation in the West Bank - in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction - has reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security and stability" of the region, Mr Biden said in a letter to Congress explaining his reasoning.A senior administration official said the initial round of sanctions - targeting four people - were against "individuals that have directly perpetrated violence and those who have engaged in repeated acts of intimidation, property destruction, leading to the forced displacement of Palestinian communities".They said one person initiated and led a riot that led to the death of a Palestinian civilian in the town of Huwara, while another had attacked people with stones and clubs.They added that the executive order was "non-discriminatory" and applied to both Israelis and Palestinians who direct or take part in violent acts or threats against civilians, intimidation, destroying, seizing property or terrorism.  The US Treasury named the four sanctioned Israelis as David Chai Chasdai, 29; Yinon Levi 31; Einan Tanjil, 21; and Shalom Zicherman 32. Three of them lived in West Bank settlements and one lived near the occupied region's border, the Treasury said.These US sanctions cannot be applied to American citizens, some of whom are thought to be involved in the violence.  State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the US does believes the sanctions "will have an impact on these four individuals" and expects Israel to "do more to hold accountable those responsible for settler violence".Shortly after Mr Biden signed the executive order, Israel signalled its dissatisfaction and described the majority of West Bank settlers as "law-abiding"."Israel takes action against all law-breakers everywhere, and therefore there is no need for unusual measures on the issue," a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said.The response was yet another sign of a deepening public rift between the US and Israel.The two leaders are long-term allies, but have disagreed in recent weeks about the idea of creating an independent Palestinian state. The US believes a Palestinian state alongside Israel - known as a "two-state solution" - is vital for long-term stability in the region.Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the idea, and the White House acknowledged last month that the US and Israeli governments "clearly see things differently".Those comments dampened hopes in some circles that the conflict could result in Israeli and Palestinian leaders restarting diplomatic negotiations and kickstarting the dormant peace process.	
01/02/2024 18:16:00	US and UK strikes fail to slow Houthi attacks - BBC News	Repeated US and UK air strikes against the Houthis in Yemen have failed to slow their attacks on ships in the region, BBC Verify has found.There have been nine attacks on ships in the past three weeks, compared with six in the previous three weeks. Since the US-led strikes began on 11 January, shipping using the vital Red Sea trade route has dropped by 29%. That's a greater rate of decline than between the start of Houthi attacks in November and the beginning of the US-led action.The Houthis initially said they were attacking ships connected to Israel, or heading to or from there. But since air strikes began in January they have mostly targeted ships tied to owners or operators in the UK or US.In total, 28 vessels have been targeted since Houthi attacks began in November. We've identified seven of these with links to Israeli companies, individuals or destinations.BBC Verify has used vessel tracking data and official company records to establish these ownership links where possible. However, identifying vessel affiliation is not a straightforward process as multiple layers of company ownership can be difficult to penetrate.  Of the nine ships attacked since the air strikes began, five had American or British links, and none had identifiable Israeli links.As well as their targets, their tactics have changed.In November and December, their attacks were concentrated at the southern end of the Red Sea close to the narrow Bab al-Mandab Strait where ships are forced to sail very close to the coast of Houthi-controlled Yemeni territory. In recent weeks they have been mainly striking further to the south in the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis have also changed how they attack. Initially they used both missiles and drones carrying explosives, but more recent attacks have used mainly missiles launched from Yemen.The Red Sea is a key shipping lane, and the most efficient way to transport goods between Asia and Europe. But the number of commercial ships using the route has fallen by 50% since the start of the Houthi attacks, according to ship tracking firm Lloyd's List Intelligence.This is despite a US-led military partnership, involving UK naval vessels, safeguarding commercial shipping in the area.It does not seem that the fall-off was seasonal as there was no similar pattern of decline in the same period last year.How did the decline come about?There was no perceptible initial response from shipping companies to the hijacking of the Galaxy Leader on 19 November.  But ship tracking data shows that this changed from 15 December, when ship operators began taking decisions to re-route their cargo around Africa. The decline in ships using the Red Sea has continued in the weeks since, despite significantly more fuel being needed for the alternative route, as well as higher crew wages and insurance costs. As an example, the cost of transporting a standard 40ft container from Shanghai to Rotterdam has risen from about $1,200 (£940) in mid-November to almost $5,000 at the end of January.As freight charges rise, there will inevitably be pressure on the prices of all manner of consumer goods from fuel to food. Sailing from the Middle East to Europe around Africa, instead of through the Suez Canal, can add three weeks to the journey time and cost over $2m more, according to price reporting firm Argus Media.This map, based on data from the maritime AI company Windward, shows significantly higher traffic around Africa in January 2024 compared with the same period last year. With fewer ships passing through the Suez Canal, the canal's governing body says its revenues in January have dropped by 44% compared with the same month in 2023. It's also anticipating revenues to decline by 40% this year to $6bn on the assumption that the shipping crisis in the region will continue. Data from Lloyd's List Intelligence indicates that this is particularly true of certain vessel types such as container ships - where a small number of companies, like Maersk, control large portions of the global tally of ships.The number of oil tankers using the Suez Canal had almost doubled over the past two years, as sanctions against Russian energy forced European countries to source oil and gas from Asia.  That has fallen since the Houthi attacks started, though not as dramatically as for container shipping.Ship operators choosing to risk the dangers of the Red Sea route have adopted various measures to reduce the possibility of attack.Some companies are paying for armed security teams on board their vessels to repel any hijacking attempts.Others have disabled their on-board AIS tracking - the system all commercial shipping uses to allow their position and declared route to be monitored - making it harder for Houthi forces to locate them.Some have taken to declaring "no link to Israel" on their location equipment, or have written "armed guards on board" or "all Chinese crew" - underscoring what ship owners believe will deter attackers.Some Chinese companies have capitalised on assurances of safe passage by the Houthis, and Lloyd's List Intelligence says that the proportion of Chinese-affiliated shipping has increased since the end of November from 13% to 28% of all vessels passing through the Red Sea.With additional reporting by Tom Spencer	
01/02/2024 09:57:00	Houthi Red Sea attacks: Group claims to have hit US container ship - BBC News	The Houthi movement in Yemen says it has struck a US merchant ship it named as KOI in the Red Sea in a fresh attack targeting commercial shipping. But two maritime sources told BBC Verify that the Houthi claim was fake. US and UK authorities are yet to say whether an attack took place.Security firm Ambrey said a ship located south of Yemen reported a blast on its starboard but did not name it.Meanwhile, the US launched new air strikes in Yemen.Ten drones reportedly being set up to launch were targeted in the strike. According to Reuters news agency, the KOI is a Liberian-flagged container ship operated by UK-based Oceonix Services. The same company's fleet includes the oil tanker Marlin Luanda, which was damaged by a missile on Saturday.The Houthis regard all Israeli, US and British ships as legitimate targets following Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza, and US and British targeting of Houthi missile positions in what the two countries say are efforts to protect commerce. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said on Wednesday that the movement's armed forces had targeted an American merchant ship named KOI with "several appropriate naval missiles". The ship, he said, had been heading to "the ports of occupied Palestine", a phrase which is sometimes used to mean Israel. However industry publication Trade Winds said that the claim was "fake" and that in fact a sick crew member had been taken off the ship in a medical evacuation.Two maritime security sources supported this assessment. There has also been no word from UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), which normally sends alerts when such attacks are carried out.But Mr Sarea reiterated that the Houthis would "not hesitate" to retaliate against "British-American escalation"."All American and British ships in the Red and Arabian Seas are legitimate targets for the Yemeni Armed Forces as long as the American-British aggression against our country continues," the Houthi spokesman said.Troubled Waters: War in the Red Sea?Frank Gardner explains who the Houthis are and what they want.Available now on BBC iPlayerUS Central Command said the 10 drones being prepared for launch in Yemen had posed a threat to merchant vessels and US warships in the region.  All 10 were destroyed along with a Houthi drone ground control station, it said. The US added that one of its warships had shot down three Iranian drones and a Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile in the Gulf of Aden.Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have slowed down international trade, raising fears of supply bottlenecks.   On 7 October, hundreds of Palestinian gunmen from Gaza infiltrated southern Israel, where they killed around 1,300 people - mostly civilians - and took 250 others hostage.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 26,900 people - most of them women and children - have been killed, according to the health ministry there which is controlled by the Hamas group.Additional reporting by Josh Cheetham, BBC Verify	
01/02/2024 03:55:00	Bi-2: Russian anti-war band leaves Thailand for Israel - BBC News	An anti-war Russian-Belarusian rock band says all its members have left Thailand for Israel after fears they would be deported to Russia.Bi-2 had been playing in a Thai resort popular with Russian tourists when members were arrested for unauthorised shows.Human rights activists urged Thailand not to deport them for fear they would be persecuted in their home countries.Now the band says it is on its way to Tel Aviv in Israel.The band's frontman, Yegor "Lyova" Bortnik, has already arrived in the Israeli city, Radio Free Europe reports. On its Facebook page, the band announced on Wednesday: "All the musicians in Bi-2 have successfully left Thailand and are heading to Tel Aviv. Details tomorrow."      The band was being held in the capital Bangkok after being arrested while touring Phuket, a resort island that hosts hundreds of thousands of Russian visitors each year.In an earlier statement it said that "outside pressure" had "played a significant role" in its detention by the Thai authorities. "We know that the reason for this pressure is [retaliation] for our creativity, our views, our position," it said.The band has been touring outside Russia since 2022, including playing shows across Europe last year.In May, Russia's justice ministry labelled Bortnik a "foreign agent" for "opposing" Russia's invasion of Ukraine and "making negative statements" about Russia, its citizens and authorities.The band has been singled out by Russian lawmakers before for its alleged "anti-Russian stance". Russian state TV quoted the Russian ambassador to Thailand, Yevgeny Tomikhin, on Tuesday as saying that Moscow had not requested the band's extradition. Thailand and, in particular, its desirable island holiday spots such as Phuket have seen a huge influx of Russian tourists since the war began in Ukraine nearly two years ago. Many Russians have fled the country to avoid conscription. By some estimates, nearly half a million Russians arrived in Phuket in the first half of 2023. 	
01/02/2024 03:00:00	White House blames Iran-backed umbrella group for deadly drone strike - BBC News	The White House has blamed an Iran-backed militia umbrella group for a deadly attack on a US base in Jordan, as it considers how to hit back.National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said US intelligence believed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq was behind Sunday's drone strike.President Joe Biden has said without elaborating that he has already decided what the US response will be.The strike killed three US soldiers and injured at least 40 other US troops.The "attribution that our intelligence community is comfortable with is that this was done by the umbrella group", said Mr Kirby in a daily press briefing on Wednesday.The Islamic Resistance in Iraq - which is believed to contain multiple militias that have been armed, funded and trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guards force - has already claimed responsibility for the strike.The national security spokesman repeated that the US response would be "in a time and in a manner of our choosing, on our schedule"."Just because you haven't seen anything in the last 48 hours, it doesn't mean that you're not going to see anything," he said."The first thing you see won't be the last thing," he added.Mr Biden has said he does not want a wider conflict in the Middle East, which has already been destabilised by the Israel-Gaza war that erupted in October.Iran has denied any role in the drone attack.At an event on Wednesday, Revolutionary Guards commander Major General Hossein Salami, who advises Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that Tehran hears the "threats coming from American officials". "No threat will be left unanswered," he added. His remarks came a day after Amir Saeed Iravani, Iran's ambassador to the UN, told Iranian journalists in New York that Tehran would "decisively respond" to any attack on the country, according to the state-run Irna news agency.While Washington weighs its response, Kataib Hezbollah, part of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, said on Tuesday it had suspended operations against US forces to avoid causing "embarrassment" to the Iraqi government.Three American soldiers who were based at Fort Moore, in the US state of Georgia, died in the drone strike in north-eastern Jordan.At least 41 National Guard members were injured, US officials confirmed on Wednesday.The injured soldiers are from units based in Arizona, California, Kentucky and New York. Twenty-seven were able to return to duty while 14 others continue to be medically evaluated, the US National Guard Bureau said.Meanwhile, the Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen have continued to carry out missile and drone attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea in response to the war in Gaza. A ship in the Gulf of Aden was struck by a missile fired from the Taiz region, according to Ambrey, a maritime security firm. A spokesman for the Houthis confirmed the attack.US Central Command, which oversees US military actions in the Middle East, said that the USS Carney shot down one Houthi-fired missile headed towards the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday night.The US naval destroyer also "engaged and shot down" three Iranian drones "in its vicinity".Officials also said US fighter jets destroyed 10 drones in Yemen that were preparing to be launched. According to the Pentagon, the Houthis have launched more than 30 attacks on commercial ships since 19 November. The ongoing attacks have disrupted global trade and triggered retaliatory strikes from both American and British forces. 	
01/02/2024 02:58:00	Red Sea attacks: Ship stranded at sea with livestock docks in Australia - BBC News	A ship carrying 16,000 sheep and cattle that had been stranded off the coast of Australia in extreme heat has returned to a Perth port.Last month, the MV Bahijah abandoned its journey through the Red Sea - where Houthi fighters in Yemen have been attacking ships - leaving the animals stuck on board for weeks. The vessel had remained at sea pending an Australian decision on whether the livestock could be offloaded.Officials cited biosecurity risks.It is still unclear whether the animals will be permitted to disembark from the vessel.On Thursday, Australia's agriculture department said that veterinarians who had examined the animals found no "significant health, welfare or environmental" concerns and that it was determining its next steps.In an earlier update, it stressed that any livestock arriving in the country would be subject to "strict biosecurity controls" and that their "health and welfare" was the highest priority. Australia's government says its biosecurity rules, some of the toughest on the planet, have kept the country free from many of the world's most invasive pests and diseases.The incident highlights the far-reaching consequences of recent attacks on ships by Houthi militia, who are backed by Iran. The fighters began attacking ships in response to Israel's actions in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. They have insisted they only target ships linked to Israel.The vessel in question was bound for Israel when it set sail from Fremantle in Perth on 5 January. The animals were among hundreds of thousands sent from Australia to the Middle East every year.The government says it told the ship to return to Australia on 20 January, citing the "exceptional circumstances" at work. The Red Sea is a critical shipping route which provides access to the Suez Canal - which itself offers the quickest way for ships to pass between Asia and Europe. Ongoing insecurity has prompted international shipping firms to take long diversions around southern Africa, causing severe disruption to global supply chains.The US and UK have launched strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, saying they are protecting commerce. They have been supported by several other countries including Australia. Some 14,000 sheep and 2,000 cattle are stuck on board the Bahijah in temperatures close to 40C (104F), the Reuters news agency quoted farm and exporter groups as saying. The ship's manager has not commented on the plight of the livestock. The Australian government looked to strike a reassuring note in its Wednesday-evening update, which said two independent vets had been to visit the animals on board.They found "no evidence of any significant health, welfare or environmental concerns", the statement said.The events have shone a spotlight on the conditions faced by animals sent on vessels overseas.Last April, New Zealand banned the live export of animals after an incident that saw thousands of cows drown in a shipwreck. The Australian government has pledged to outlaw the export of live sheep.	
31/01/2024 23:26:00	Israelis tell British MPs of evidence of Hamas sexual violence - BBC News	Israelis who dealt with the bodies of victims of Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israel have told British MPs and peers that there was "deliberate, systematic genital mutilation" of female victims and that there was "no question" that some had been sexually assaulted.Business Secretary and Minister for Women Kemi Badenoch said all the reports must be fully investigated and sexual violence must be condemned. "Rape is not resistance," she stated.   Hamas has denied its gunmen sexually assaulted women during the attacks.But a senior Israeli police officer said her force had "clear evidence" that rape and other acts of sexual violence had been committed on a scale large enough to define it as a crime against humanity. Warning: Readers may find some of the details below distressing.On 7 October, hundreds of Palestinian gunmen from Gaza infiltrated southern Israel, where they killed around 1,300 people - mostly civilians - and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 26,900 people - most of them women and children - have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Many of the MPs and members of the House of Lords who attended Wednesday's meeting in Parliament were in tears as they listened to the testimony of the Israelis. Shari Mendes, an architect, was called up as a reservist by the Israeli military to help medics identify female bodies brought to the Shura army base after 7 October.  "Many women arrived with bloody, shredded underwear, many arrived with no clothing," she said. "Our team commander saw several female soldiers who were shot in the vagina, the crotch or they were shot in the breast. This was gratuitous. This was a deliberate, systematic, genital mutilation."  Ms Mendes said her identification unit had seen bodies decapitated or with limbs cut off. "I'm here to be their voice," she said. Simcha Greiniman was a volunteer for Zaka, an Israeli religious organisation that collects remains of the dead for burial. He told the BBC he had recovered many bodies after the Hamas attack. "In one of the houses there was a woman separated from her family. She was in her bedroom leaning on her bed," he recalled. "She was half naked from the waist down. She was shot in the back of her head... She had a live grenade in her hand."  He described finding another woman who had "nails and different objects in her body, in women's personal places", adding: "It's something you can't imagine." Mr Greiniman was clear that some of the victims he had seen had been sexually attacked. "For sure, for sure, there's no question," he said. "I'm the person that dealt with it. I'm the eyes."  "I'm here to say, 'Yes, this is what happened,' and to show the world. We are telling the truth and the world has to understand and do something with it."  His plea to the international community was to understand that it had happened and not push it away, and to put those in charge behind bars. "They have to pay for what they did," he said. Neither Ms Mendes nor Mr Greiniman are experts on sexual violence, but their testimony is in line with the evidence that the Israeli government says has been collected from forensic investigations as well as from hundreds of statements by witnesses and first responders.  Chief Superintendent Mirit Ben Mayor of the Israel Police told the Parliamentarians that it had not been easy to collect evidence because of the many different locations and because people had been murdered. But she said: "There is clear evidence that rape and sexual violence offences were committed against the victims. We are investigating crimes against humanity." The BBC has also seen and heard evidence that women were raped and mutilated. It includes video testimony from an eyewitness at the Nova music festival, videos of naked and bloodied women filmed by Hamas gunmen, and photographs of bodies taken at the scenes of a number of attacks. The cousin of 19-year-old female hostage Agam Berger told the meeting that they had to bring home the more than 100 Israelis and foreign nationals believed to still be held captive in Gaza.Ashley Waxman Bakshi said she did not even know if her cousin wanted to stay alive after being held for so long.  "You can clearly understand our worry with every minute that passes when our women and girls are in the hands of these monsters, if they were able to do this in eight hours or 12 hours on 7 October," she said. "They have been there for 117 days. What if they are pregnant?" Kemi Badenoch said the UK stood in solidarity with all the victims. She also called on international organisations to do more to be clear in their condemnation of sexual violence against Israelis, saying there must not be double standards. Israeli officials and activists have complained that leaders of the UN and other international organisations have been slow to respond to the allegations. On Monday, the UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Pramila Patten, arrived in Israel on a visit to "give voice to survivors, witnesses, recently released hostages and those affected; to identify avenues for support, including justice and accountability; and to gather, analyse and verify information".  In a message to victims, their families and witnesses published by the Israeli presidency, Ms Patten said: "Please come forward, please break your silence, because your silence will be the licence of those perpetrators." "We really want to ensure that [victims] have justice so that we put an end to this heinous act," she added. Two UN human rights experts said earlier this month that the reported acts of sexual violence constituted "gross violations of international law, amounting to war crimes which, given the number of victims and the extensive premeditation and planning of the attacks, may also qualify as crimes against humanity". 	
31/01/2024 21:07:00	Swedish police destroy object outside Israeli embassy in Stockholm - BBC News	A "dangerous object" found outside the Israeli embassy in Stockholm has been destroyed, Swedish police say.The incident - labelled an "attempted attack" by the Israeli ambassador - saw officers cordon off a wide area nearby.Police told the BBC it was too early to give further details on the object. They said no-one had been injured.A spokesman later told the AFP news agency that staff had found a "live" device and alerted officers at about 13:10 local time (12:10 GMT).The object was assessed by the national bomb squad, who chose to destroy it, the spokesman added. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said the situation was "very serious" and Sweden's Security Service are investigating "who is or who are responsible".Surveillance of the embassy and of Jewish institutions had been tightened, Mr Kristersson added.A police spokesperson told TV4 the device was detonated in a controlled manner. Swedish tabloids Expressen and Aftonbladet reported it was a hand grenade, citing unnamed sources.Meanwhile, national broadcaster SVT said armed police attended the scene and brought sandbags with them, reportedly to use during the disposal of the object.The Israeli ambassador to Sweden said there had been an "attempted attack" on the embassy and its employees."We will not be intimidated by terror," Ziv Nevo Kulman posted on X. He thanked the Swedish authorities for their "swift action".In her own post, Sweden's Deputy Prime Minister Ebba Busch said she was "shaken", adding: "The hatred against Israel is frightening. Violent extremism must be stopped."Police say they are investigating, and have not said who might have planted the suspicious device.The embassy is located by the waterside in the affluent Ostermalm area of Stockholm's city centre.	
31/01/2024 12:59:00	The 2024 election risks for Biden after deadly Jordan attack - BBC News	The deaths of three American soldiers - two women and a man from the US state of Georgia - in a drone attack in Jordan on Sunday was exactly what the Biden administration was dreading. And it means the White House is taking an extremely difficult decision over how to respond. President Biden, who met his national security team in the Situation Room on Monday, says he has decided what to do after currently weighing the options before him. He could choose to strike Iran-allied targets in the region, hit Iran itself, or do nothing at all. All options come with serious risk, especially in an election year where the president has to balance looking strong with ensuring an already dangerous situation does not spin out of control. "We don't want a wider war with Iran," National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby told reporters. "We don't want a wider war in the region, but we've got to do what we have to do."The Biden administration also has to consider its response to Iran in the context of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. Since 7 October, the US's main priority has been to stop the conflict in Gaza from spreading in the region. That's what governed the carefully calibrated American responses to the previous non-fatal attacks on its forces in region.This deadly attack completely changes the equation - the US now feels like it has no choice but to respond forcefully. Yet the need to strike a delicate balance remains. So President Biden needs to find a course of action that sends a much more robust message of deterrence, without causing the very escalation they've been working so hard to avoid.Mr Biden's political rivals - by virtue of being out of power - face no such dilemma. Donald Trump, the clear frontrunner in the race to pick a Republican presidential candidate, set the tone with a Sunday night post on social media that laid the blame squarely on the president. "This brazen attack on the United States is yet another horrific and tragic consequence of Joe Biden's weakness and surrender," Mr Trump wrote.The former president did not say, however, how he would respond if he was in office and he has not commented further. Other Republicans have not held back.  Senator Tom Cotton said "the only answer to these attacks must be devastating military retaliation". Anything less, he added, would confirm the president was a "coward".The leading Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, called for "serious, crippling cost to Iran". Senator Lindsay Graham said the US should "strike targets of significance inside Iran".But leading Democrats did not go as far - most called for those responsible to be held accountable and for the US to target Iran-backed groups rather than the country itself. "This attack… cannot go unanswered," Senator Ben Cardin, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said. "I support President Biden in a deliberate and proportionate response."Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal used similar language, writing on X that "a strong, surgical response is vital against Iran-backed forces".The Biden administration has said its decision on how to respond will not be based on polls or the looming election. "He's not looking at political calculations," John Kirby told reporters. But in an election year, any foreign policy decision is inevitably influenced by domestic politics. How will military action - or inaction - be perceived by American voters?  It is often assumed that foreign policy plays a minor part on the decisions voters make about who they want as their president. But with conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, polls suggest it is important for more voters this year.The details of this particular attack may well have faded by November when Americans go to the polls - but people do care about the image they think their nation projects in the world. I've heard voters across America tell me they are concerned that the US looks weak these days. They like Donald Trump's promise of strong-man-leadership that will mean no other country would dare to try push America around.Obviously it is much easier to talk about military strategy and global diplomacy on the campaign trail than it is inside the White House situation room. Joe Biden, meanwhile, is faced with a delicate and dangerous decision that could have far-reaching consequences in the Middle East. But his response could also have repercussions closer to home in what is a high-stakes election year.	
31/01/2024 10:19:00	Grandfather held in Dubai over party row to face court - BBC News	A grandfather from Aberdeenshire who is unable to leave Dubai following a noise row with neighbours has been told the case will go to court.Ian Mackellar, 74, and his wife, of Newtonhill, had been visiting their daughter and young granddaughter in the United Arab Emirates when he went to complain about music during a Hogmanay party.He was then reported to the police, accused of trespassing. The resulting investigation meant he was not allowed to leave the country.The family hoped the matter would resolve and he could come home, but his wife Carol, 71, told BBC Scotland News that police say it will proceed to court.Mrs Mackellar said: "The police have completed their investigations. “Ian has been given a new case number and we've been told the case will be going from a complaint case to a court case."We're very upset. I just want him home."She added: "His sister has decided to fly over to see him as we are so worried about him, mentally and physically."The couple had travelled over last month to help their daughter settle in the country.However things turned sour when Mr Mackellar went to ask neighbours to turn down music on the night of 31 December as family members were trying to sleep.Mrs Mackellar said her husband went to have a "neighbour-to-neighbour" chat to ask them to turn it down a bit.But she said some people became "aggressive", and that one person threw a drink.Mrs Mackellar said the police then came to their door two days later and informed them of the trespass complaint.Andrew Bowie, the MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, said work was ongoing to support his constituent."We are absolutely determined to ensure that Mr Mackellar sees justice and indeed that he is released," he said.The Foreign Office has said it is providing consular assistance to a British man in Dubai.The Government of Dubai Media Office has been approached for comment.	
31/01/2024 09:51:00	Kataib Hezbollah: Iran-backed group suspends attacks against US after drone strike - BBC News	An Iran-backed Iraqi militia suspected of a drone strike in Jordan that killed three US soldiers says it has suspended operations against US forces. Kataib Hezbollah, which is part of an umbrella group that claimed Sunday's attack, said this was "to prevent embarrassment of the Iraqi government".The US defence department said: "Actions speak louder than words."US President Joe Biden meanwhile said he had decided how to respond to the attack but did not elaborate.Iran warned it would retaliate against any attack on its "interests".  Earlier, it denied US and British accusations that it was involved in the attack.The US has hinted at an armed response that might come in several waves.  Kataib Hezbollah Secretary-General Abu Hussein al-Hamidawi said in a statement on Tuesday: "As we announce the suspension of military and security operations against the occupation forces - in order to prevent embarrassment of the Iraqi government - we will continue to defend our people in Gaza in other ways."The three US soldiers were killed at a base next to the Jordanian-Syrian border by a "type of Shahed drone", the one-way attack drones Iran has been providing to Russia, a US official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.Dozens more soldiers were injured in the attack on Tower 22, which was struck while US forces were asleep in their bunks.The US has blamed Iran-backed groups and has not yet conclusively determined that Kataib Hezbollah was behind it.However, a Pentagon spokeswoman said it carried "the footprints" of the group."Actions speak louder than words," Pat Ryder told reporters after the group released its statement. "There will be consequences," he added.Meanwhile, the US is taking steps to bolster security at Tower 22, where some 350 US soldiers are stationed in a mission focused on defeating the Islamic State (IS) group. Additional air defences are being sent to the base, a US official told CBS News on Tuesday, including a system designed to intercept drones."Certainly all roads of responsibility lead back to Iran," House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner told BBC News, also linking the country to attacks by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement against ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. "This needs to be responded in a way where they understand that we're not going to just continue to play defensive," he said. He added that the US reaction would force Iran to "understanding that this is a conflict that is going to come to their doorstep".Mr Biden has been weighing a number of retaliatory options, including strikes on Iran-aligned militia bases and commanders.The US could also target senior commanders of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iraq or Syria.It is also possible that the US will attack inside Iran's borders, a move which is considered the highest possible escalation that Mr Biden could take.In New York, the Iranian envoy to the UN, Amir Saeed Iravani, warned that Iran would "decisively respond to any attack on the country, its interests and nationals under any pretexts", Iran's state news agency Irna reported.  He also denied reports that several messages had been exchanged between the US and Iran via intermediaries over the past two days.Iran has built a wide network of allied armed groups and proxies operating in countries across the Middle East. They are all opposed to Israel and the US, and sometimes refer to themselves as the "Axis of Resistance", though the extent of Iran's influence over them is not clear.The US says co-ordination is overseen by the IRGC and its overseas operations arm, the Quds Force. Both are designated by the US as terrorist organisations, as are a number of the regional armed groups, including Kataib Hezbollah.The groups have dramatically stepped up their attacks against Israel, US forces and other linked targets since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip in October, in what they say is a demonstration of their solidarity with the Palestinian people.Many of the at least 165 drone, rocket and missile attacks on US bases in Iraq and Syria, or facilities hosting US troops, since 17 October have been claimed by an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. In response, the US says it has struck targets belonging to the IRGC and militias believed to have strong links with the force, including Kataib Hezbollah, Harakat al-Nujaba and Asaib Ahl al-Haq.Sunday's attack, which the Islamic Resistance in Iraq said it was behind, was the first to kill US troops in the region since the start of the Gaza war.Last month, the US said it carried out air strikes against Iran-affiliated groups after three US service members were injured, one critically, in a drone attack on a base in northern Iraq.Earlier in January, a US strike in Baghdad killed a leader of Harakat al-Nujaba who was accused of being behind attacks on US personnel.US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said last week that strikes on three facilities in Iraq belonging to Kataib Hezbollah and other groups were "in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks" against US and other international forces in Iraq and Syria.David Gritten contributed to this article	
31/01/2024 09:50:00	What is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza? - BBC News	Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas have been at war since early October. It began when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel from Gaza - the deadliest in Israel's history. An Israeli military campaign has followed, which has killed thousands in the Palestinian territory.On the morning of 7 October, waves of Hamas gunmen stormed across Gaza's border into Israel. Hamas also fired thousands of rockets. The gunmen killed 1,200 people on the day and more than 100 later died from their injuries. Those killed included children, the elderly and 364 young people at a music festival.  Hamas took more than 250 others to Gaza as hostages.The BBC has also seen evidence of rape and sexual violence during the Hamas attacks.  Hamas became the sole ruler of Gaza after violently ejecting political rivals in 2007.It has an armed wing and was thought to have 30,000 fighters before the start of the war.The group, whose name stands for Islamic Resistance Movement, wants to create an Islamic state in place of Israel. Hamas rejects Israel's right to exist and is committed to its destruction. Hamas justified its attack as a response to what it calls Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people. These include security raids on Islam's third holiest site - the al-Aqsa Mosque, in occupied East Jerusalem - and Jewish settlement activity in the occupied West Bank.  Hamas also wants thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israel to be freed and for an end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip by Israel and Egypt - something both countries say is for security. It has fought several wars with Israel since it took power, fired thousands of rockets and carried out other deadly attacks.  Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes and sent troops into Gaza in 2008 and 2014. Hamas, or in some cases its armed wing alone, is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the US, the EU, and the UK, among others. Iran backs Hamas with funding, weapons and training.Israel immediately began a massive campaign of air strikes on targets in Gaza, in response to the Hamas attack Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's aims were the destruction of Hamas and the return of the hostages.  Israel launched a ground invasion three weeks later. It has also bombarded Gaza from the sea. Attacks were initially focused on northern Gaza, particularly Gaza City and tunnels beneath it, which Israel said were the centre of military operations by Hamas. All 1.1 million people living in the north were ordered by Israel to evacuate south for their safety. Following a temporary truce in late November, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was extending ground operations to southern Gaza.  Troops reached the heart of the second biggest city, Khan Younis, where the IDF said it believed top Hamas commanders were hiding.  Hundreds of thousands of displaced people from the north were forced to move further south. The IDF also pushed into refugee camps in central Gaza. More than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed, and tens of thousands injured by Israeli strikes since the start of the war, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. It says most were women and children.   The IDF says it has killed about 9,000 Hamas fighters, in addition to more than 1,000 of the attackers inside Israel. It has not said how it came to this figure. Israel says more than 200 of its soldiers have been killed in Gaza.Homes and other buildings in Gaza have suffered from extensive damage and destruction.  Most of the 250 men, women and children abducted by Hamas were civilians. They included elderly people and those with disabilities and medical conditions. The youngest was nine months old. In Gaza, Hamas hid them in tunnels and fighters' homes. Unconfirmed reports suggest some have been held by other militant groups. During November's truce, 105 hostages (81 Israelis and dual nationals, and 24 foreigners) were released in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.Four hostages had previously been freed by Hamas and one rescued by the IDF.  Three hostages were accidentally killed by Israeli troops who mistook them for Hamas fighters. Israel cut off supplies of food, water and fuel, to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages.  It led to severe shortages among Gaza's population. Israel has since allowed in humanitarian aid, medicines and limited amounts of fuel. However, the amount of aid getting into Gaza is well below pre-war levels.  The UN has accused Israel of obstructing the delivery of aid, while Israel has blamed the UN for problems. In mid-January, the UN described the situation in Gaza as "horrific", with shelters overflowing, and food and water running out. It warned of a growing risk of famine. Gaza's health system is in a state of collapse. Only 16 out of its 36 hospitals are partially open.  They are overwhelmed by the huge number of injured and are struggling with shortages of staff, medical supplies, food, fuel and water. The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Previously occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. Israel withdrew its troops and about 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005. Home to 2.2 million people, it is one of the world's most densely populated places. Just over three-quarters of Gaza's population are registered refugees, or descendants of refugees, the UN says. Israel controls the air space over Gaza, its shoreline and its shared border, and limits the movement of people and goods. The West Bank and Gaza are known as the Palestinian territories.  Along with East Jerusalem and Israel, they formed part of  land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century. In 1948, part of Palestine became Israel, which was recognised by the UN the following year. The West Bank - including East Jerusalem - and Gaza are recognised as Palestine by many countries and bodies, although it does not have UN member status. Those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist refer to all of the West Bank, Jerusalem, Gaza and Israel as Palestine.The UN considers the West Bank and Gaza as a single Israeli-occupied territory. However, the two areas are run by rival Palestinian administrations.  The West Bank is governed with limited self-rule by the Palestinian Authority (PA), under President Mahmoud Abbas, and Israel has overall control. The PA officially recognises Israel. Hamas, in Gaza, does not recognise Israel. The future of the West Bank and East Jerusalem is one of the most difficult issues of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. An internationally backed plan for peace is known as the "two-state solution".It would mean an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital. This Palestinian state would exist alongside Israel. Israel's most important ally, the US, sees a two-state solution as the way forward once the Gaza war ends. A two-state solution is also formally supported by the PA.However, since 1967, Israel has built about 140 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.  The settlements are regarded as illegal by most of the rest of the world, though Israel disputes this.  The PA insists all settlements must be removed as part of any future peace deal. The idea of a two-state solution has never been officially advocated by Israel, and Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly stated his opposition.He says Israel must retain full security control over the West Bank and Gaza. 	
31/01/2024 06:00:00	Injured, hungry and alone - the Gazan children orphaned by war - BBC News	Born amid the horrors of the war in Gaza, the month-old baby girl lying in an incubator has never known a parent's embrace.She was delivered by Caesarean section after her mother, Hanna, was crushed in an Israeli air strike. Hanna did not live to name her daughter."We just call her the daughter of Hanna Abu Amsha," says nurse Warda al-Awawda, who is caring for the tiny newborn at the al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions which some may find upsetting. In the chaos caused by the ongoing fighting and with entire families almost wiped out, medics and rescuers often struggle to find carers for bereaved children.  "We have lost contact with her family," the nurse tells us. "None of her relatives have shown up and we don't know what happened to her father."Children, who make up nearly half of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, have had their lives shattered by the brutal war.Although Israel says it strives to avoid civilian casualties, including issuing evacuation orders, more than 11,500 under-18s have been killed according to Palestinian health officials. Even more have injuries, many of them life-changing.It is hard to get accurate figures but according to a recent report from Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, a non-profit group, more than 24,000 children have also lost one or both parents.  Ibrahim Abu Mouss, just 10 years old, suffered severe leg and stomach injuries when a missile hit his home. But his tears are for his dead mum, grandfather and sister."They kept telling me they were being treated upstairs in the hospital," says Ibrahim as his father clutches his hand. "But I found out the truth when I saw photos on my dad's phone. I cried so much that I hurt all over."The cousins of the Hussein family used to play together but now they sit solemnly by the sandy graves where some of their relatives are buried by a school-turned-shelter in central Gaza. Each has lost one or both parents."The missile fell on my mum's lap and her body was torn into pieces. For days we were taking her body parts from the rubble of the house," says Abed Hussein, who lived in al-Bureij refugee camp.  "When they said that my brother, my uncle and my whole family were killed I felt like my heart was bleeding with fire."With dark bags around his eyes, Abed stays awake at night frightened by the sounds of Israeli shelling and feeling alone. "When my mum and dad were alive, I used to sleep but after they were killed, I can't sleep any more. I used to sleep next to my dad," he explains.Abed and his two surviving siblings are being looked after by his grandmother but everyday life is very hard. "There's no food or water," he says. "I have a stomach ache from drinking sea water."Kinza Hussein's father was killed trying to fetch flour to make bread. She is haunted by the image of his corpse, brought home for burial after he was killed by a missile. "He had no eyes, and his tongue was cut," she remembers."All we want is for the war to be over," she says. "Everything is sad." Nearly everyone in Gaza now relies on aid handouts for the basics of life. According to UN figures, some 1.7 million people have been displaced, with many forced to move repeatedly in search of safety.But the UN's children's agency, Unicef, says its biggest concern is for an estimated 19,000 children who are orphaned or have ended up alone with no adult to look after them."Many of these children have been found under the rubble or have lost their parents in the bombing of their home," Jonathan Crickx, chief of communications for Unicef Palestine, tells me from Rafah in southern Gaza. Others have been found at Israeli checkpoints, hospitals and on the streets."The youngest ones very often cannot say their name and even the older ones are usually in shock so it can be extremely difficult to identify them and potentially regroup them with their extended family."Even when relatives can be found, they are not always well placed to help care for bereaved children.  "Let's keep in mind they are often also in a very dire situation," Mr Crickx says. "They may have their own children to take care of and it can be difficult, if not impossible, for them to take care of these unaccompanied and separated children."Since the war started, a non-profit organisation, SOS Children's Villages, which works locally with Unicef, says it has been working to take in 55 such children, all aged under 10. It has employed additional specialist staff in Rafah to give psychological help.A senior SOS staff member tells me about a four-year-old who had been left at a checkpoint. She was brought in with selective mutism, an anxiety disorder which left her unable to speak about what had happened to her and her family, but is now making progress after being welcomed with gifts and playing with other children she lives with.Unicef believes that nearly all children in Gaza are now in need of mental health support.  With their lives shattered, even when there is a lasting ceasefire, many will be left with terrible losses that they will struggle to overcome.	
31/01/2024 02:29:00	Israel Gaza: UN warning that aid system could collapse if UNRWA funding is withheld - BBC News	Top UN officials have warned that the withdrawal of funding for its main aid agency in Gaza could lead to the "collapse of the humanitarian system".They spoke out after the US, UK and other countries halted funding over the alleged role of some UN staff in the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel. The UN sacked several of its staff over the allegations.It said an investigation into its agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, is underway.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described UNRWA as "perforated with Hamas", saying Israel has "discovered that there were 13 UNRWA workers who actually participated, either directly or indirectly, in the 7 October massacre".But the US, the biggest donor to the UNWRA, has said it wants to see the aid agency continue its work."There is no other humanitarian player in Gaza who can provide food and water and medicine at the scale that UNRWA does," US State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller said. "We want to see that work continued which is why it is so important that the United Nations take this matter seriously, that they investigate, that there is accountability for anyone who is found to have engaged in wrongdoing." In the attack on 7 October, Hamas gunmen killed about 1,300 people and took about 250 hostages.Israel launched an offensive against Hamas in response and more than 26,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.More than half of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed during the offensive, new analysis seen by the BBC has revealed.UN Secretary General António Guterres has said a full independent investigation into UNRWA is under way,A UNRWA spokesperson has said that if funding is not resumed, the agency will not be able to continue its operations beyond the end of February."The allegations of involvement of several UNRWA staff in the heinous attacks on Israel on 7 October are horrifying," a statement by the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee says."As the secretary-general has said, any UN employee involved in acts of terror will be held accountable. However, we must not prevent an entire organisation from delivering on its mandate to serve people in desperate need. "Withdrawing funds from UNRWA is perilous and would result in the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza, with far-reaching humanitarian and human rights consequences in the occupied Palestinian territory and across the region," it adds. "The world cannot abandon the people of Gaza."Also on Tuesday, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for Gaza said no other organisation can replace UNRWA due to the the agency's "knowledge" of the population in Gaza.Other countries which have halted funding include Germany, Sweden an Japan. Mr Guterres met representatives of more than 30 donor states on Tuesday and is reported to have urged those who have withdrawn funding to reconsider. 	
30/01/2024 23:15:00	Hamas says it is studying proposal for new pause in Gaza fighting - BBC News	Hamas's political leader has confirmed it is studying a new proposal to pause the fighting in the Gaza Strip.Ismail Haniyeh said the group had been invited to discuss a framework set out by Israel, the US, Qatar and Egypt. It reportedly proposes a six-week truce, when more Israeli hostages would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.Mr Haniyeh stressed that Hamas's priorities were a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal, but Israel's prime minister ruled them out.Benjamin Netanyahu insisted the war would not end until "total victory" had been achieved, which he said meant the elimination of Hamas and the release of all hostages.The conflict was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,300 people were killed and about 250 others taken hostage.More than 26,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.During a week-long ceasefire in late November, 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Israel says 136 hostages are still being held, although about two dozen of those are presumed to be dead.On Sunday, Qatar's prime minister, the director of the US Central Intelligence Agency and Egypt's intelligence chief held talks in Paris with the heads of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency and Shin Bet internal security agency.They agreed the terms of a framework for a second pause in the fighting, which US media reports said would see Hamas release any remaining elderly, women and child hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners during an initial period of six weeks. If that was successful, there could be another two phases of swaps, with male Israeli soldiers eventually included.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday that he could not confirm the details of the proposal, but called it "a strong one and a compelling one".The Israeli prime minister's office called the talks "constructive", but noted that there were "significant gaps which the parties will continue to discuss".On Tuesday morning, Hamas's Qatar-based political chief said it had received an invitation to go to Cairo to discuss the framework and would respond "on the basis that the priority is to halt the aggression on Gaza and pull the occupation forces out".Mr Haniyeh stressed that Hamas was "open to discussing any new practical initiative or ideas, provided that they should lead to a comprehensive halt to the aggression, securing shelter for our displaced people... rebuilding [Gaza], lifting the blockade and achieving a serious swap of the captives to guarantee freeing our prisoners" in Israeli jails.Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, meanwhile threatened to "dismantle" the coalition government if a "reckless deal" was reached with Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and other countries.Later, Mr Netanyahu appeared to address the remarks by both men."I would like to make it clear: We will not conclude this war without achieving all of its goals," the prime minister said in a speech in the occupied West Bank. "This means eliminating Hamas, returning all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel.""We will not withdraw [forces] from the Gaza Strip and we will not release thousands of terrorists. None of this will happen. What will happen? Total victory!"The developments came as battles raged between Israeli forces and Hamas fighters across Gaza, particularly in the southern city of Khan Younis.On Tuesday afternoon, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Israeli tanks were stationed in the "front yard" of Al-Amal Hospital, which is in the west of the city, and that they were "firing live ammunition and smoke grenades at the displaced individuals and PRCS staff"."We deeply worry for the safety of our teams, the wounded, the sick, and thousands of displaced people in the building. Fires have broken out in tents within the confines of the PRCS Headquarters," it added.A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it "did not operate inside Al-Amal Hospital or request its evacuation" on Tuesday."The IDF has maintained close communication with the hospital, additionally, monitoring efforts show that the Al-Amal hospital is functioning and has adequate fuel and electricity.""On Monday, the IDF was informed that the oxygen supply at Al-Amal hospital was at risk, which prompted the IDF to facilitate the replenishment of two oxygen tanks that arrived to Al-Amal hospital that same afternoon," it added.The IDF has previously accused Hamas of operating inside and launching attacks from hospitals, which the group and local medics have denied.Intense fighting and bombardment have also been reported around the nearby Nasser Hospital, which is the largest medical facility still functioning in Gaza.Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said on Monday that the handful of medics remaining there were contending with very low supplies to treat between 300 and 350 patients who not could be evacuated.Rami, an MSF nurse, described how surgeons in the emergency department were being forced to reuse abdominal gauze. "They use it once, then squeeze out the blood, wash it, sterilise it and reuse it with another patient," he said.The IDF believes top Hamas commanders are holed up inside tens of kilometres of tunnels beneath Khan Younis, possibly along with hostages.It says it has so far "eliminated over 2,000 terrorists above and below ground" there and uncovered facilities for holding hostages and command centres.On Tuesday, the IDF confirmed that it had been pumping "large volumes" of water into parts of Hamas's vast network of tunnels across Gaza.There was widespread concern when its plan was first reported. Hostages' families feared it could threaten their lives and experts said using seawater could gravely damage the aquifer that is Gaza's only natural water source. "The capability was developed in a professional capacity, including analysis of the soil characteristics and the water systems in the area to ensure that damage is not done to the area's groundwater," the IDF said."The pumping of water was only carried out in tunnel routes and locations that were suitable, matching the method of operation to each case."	
30/01/2024 20:58:00	Biden says he has decided US response to Jordan attack - BBC News	President Joe Biden says he has decided how the US will respond to a drone strike that killed three American troops in Jordan at the weekend. Mr Biden did not elaborate in his remarks at the White House, but added: "I don't think we need a wider war in the Middle East."An Iran-backed militia group has claimed responsibility for the attack at a US military base.Dozens more were injured in Sunday's strike near the Syrian border.The overnight drone attack was the first time US soldiers were killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the Israel Gaza war erupted on 7 October.Asked by reporters on Tuesday morning if he had decided how to respond to the attack, Mr Biden said: "Yes." He was also asked if Iran should be blamed. "I do hold them [Iran] responsible in the sense that they're supplying the weapons to the people who did it," he said. Iran has denied any involvement. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the US might take a "tiered approach" in its response. "Not just a single action, but potentially multiple actions... over a period of time," he told reporters on board Air Force One for Mr Biden's trip to attend election fundraisers in Florida. "The guiding principle is making sure that we continue to degrade the kinds of capabilities that these groups have at their disposal to use against our troops and our facilities," he said. Mr Kirby added: "The president will do what he has to do to protect our troops and our facilities and to look after our national security."The president has a number of options, including retaliatory strikes on Iran-allied bases and commanders. The US could also target senior commanders of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps in Iraq or Syria. In recent months, several US bases in the Middle East have been attacked by militias trained, funded and equipped by Iran. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq - which is made up of several Iran-affiliated militias operating - has claimed responsibility for Sunday's strike. It has also said it mounted other attacks against US forces in recent weeks.Kataib Hezbollah, an armed faction of the Islamic Resistance, said on Tuesday it would suspend all its military operations against US troops in the region to avoid "embarrassment" for the Iraqi government. The weekend's deadly strike in north-eastern Jordan hit an American military base known as Tower 22.About 350 US forces are stationed at the facility, which US Central Command says is focused on defeating the Islamic State group.The strike killed Sgt William Jerome Rivers, 46, Specialist Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, and Specialist Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23. More than 40 others were wounded, including 34 people who officials say were evaluated for possible traumatic brain injuries. The White House said on Tuesday Mr Biden had spoken with the family members of the three troops.The president will attend the "dignified transfer" of their bodies at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Friday, the national security spokesman told reporters.Mr Biden told the families "how proud we all are of their service, how we mourn and feel sorrow over their loss", Mr Kirby said. The enemy drone struck while an American drone was returning to the base from a mission. Officials say the base's air defence auto-response features were turned off to avoid shooting down the US drone. But because of that, there was no warning for troops who were reportedly still in their sleeping quarters. A supplementary air defence system, called the Coyote, is being sent to Tower 22 to help intercept drones, the BBC's US partner, CBS News, reported. Tower 22's air defences were not as robust as those of other bases in the region, an unnamed official said. 	
30/01/2024 18:18:00	UK considering recognising Palestine state, Lord Cameron says - BBC News	Britain is ready to bring forward the moment when it formally recognises a Palestinian state, the foreign secretary has suggested.Lord Cameron said Palestinians had to be given a political horizon to encourage peace in the Middle East.He is beginning his fourth visit to the region since being appointed foreign secretary in November.The UK has a responsibility to set out what a Palestinian state would look like, he told a Westminster reception.The Palestinian people would have to be shown "irreversible progress" towards a two-state solution, Lord Cameron said."As that happens, we - with allies - will look at the issue of recognising a Palestinian state, including at the United Nations," he told the Conservative Middle East Council. "That could be one of the things that helps to make this process irreversible."The foreign secretary also urged Israel to allow more humanitarian support into Gaza and said it was "ludicrous" that vital British and other aid was being sent back at the border.Lord Cameron said the last 30 years had been a story of failure for Israel because it had failed to provide security to its citizens. Only by recognising that failure, he said, would there be peace and progress.Britain has long supported a two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians could live side by side in separate countries.But Lord Cameron is suggesting Britain could give formal, diplomatic recognition to a Palestinian state not as part of a final peace deal, but earlier, during the negotiations themselves.At the same time, there would have to be a new Palestinian authority "stood up quickly" with "technocratic and good leaders" able to govern Gaza, he said.Lord Cameron added: "Together with that, almost most important of all, is to give the Palestinian people a political horizon so that they can see that there is going to be irreversible progress to a two-state solution and crucially the establishment of a Palestinian state. "We have a responsibility there because we should be starting to set out what a Palestinian state would look like, what it would comprise, how it would work and crucially, looking at the issue, that as that happens, we with allies will look at the issue of recognising a Palestinian state, including at the United Nations. "That could be one of the things that helps to make this process irreversible."As part of any long-term deal, the foreign secretary said Israel would need to see all hostages released, with a guarantee that Hamas could not launch attacks on Israel and its leadership had left Gaza.  He said a deal would be "difficult" but not impossible.Husam Zomlot, head of the Palestinian mission in London, said Lord Cameron's comments were "historic", because for first time the UK was considering recognising a Palestinian state "as a contribution to a peaceful solution rather than an outcome".However, the idea of fast-tracking Palestinian statehood prompted anger from some Conservative MPs. Former minister Theresa Villiers told the Commons "bringing forward and accelerating unilateral recognition of Palestinian state would be to reward Hamas' atrocities".Foreign Office Minister Andrew Mitchell said the government would not recognise a Palestinian state "bilaterally" but would do so "at a time when it best serves the objective of peace". The Israeli government has yet to comment.On the ongoing efforts to end the war in Gaza, Lord Cameron said a pause in the fighting was needed now and there were "hopeful signs" about the negotiations under way."There is a path that we can now see opening up where we really can make progress, not just in ending the conflict, but progress in finding a political solution that can mean peace for years rather than peace for months," he said.The real challenge would be to "turn that pause into a sustainable ceasefire without a return to the fighting, he said. "That is the prize we should be looking for, and more than that, not just how you go from pause to sustainable ceasefire, but how you go from there to a set of political moves and arrangements that could start to deliver the longer term political solution," Lord Cameron said."Although it is incredibly difficult, although efforts in the past have failed, we cannot give up. "If the last 30 years tells us anything, it is a story of failure. "Ultimately it is a story of failure for Israel because yes, they had a growing economy, yes they had rising living standards, yes they invested in defence and security and walls and the rest of it, but they couldn't provide what a state most wants, what every family wants, which is security. "And so the last 30 years has been a failure. "And it is only by recognising that failure and recognising that true peace and progress will come when the benefits of peace and progress are greater than the benefits of returning to fighting."	
30/01/2024 17:35:00	Israeli forces kill three Palestinian fighters in West Bank hospital raid - BBC News	Israeli forces have killed three members of Palestinian armed groups in a hospital in the occupied West Bank.CCTV footage showed members of an undercover unit disguised as medics and other civilians making their way through a corridor with rifles raised.The Israeli military said the men were hiding in the Jenin hospital, and that one was about to carry out an attack.The Palestinian Authority's ministry of health accused Israel of carrying out a "new massacre inside hospitals".Hamas, an armed Palestinian Islamist group which is fighting a war with Israel in Gaza triggered by its unprecedented attacks on Israel on 7 October, said the Israeli forces had "executed three fighters", including one of its members. Another armed group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, said two of those killed were its members and were brothers. It added that one of them had been receiving treatment at the hospital.The security camera video from Ibn Sina hospital shows several members of the Israeli undercover unit - men and women - hurrying through a corridor, training their weapons left and right. One can be seen taking a piece of clothing off an unidentified person who is kneeling down with his hands behind his head, then covering his head with it.The footage shows two members of the unit carrying a folded wheelchair and a baby-carrier, apparently as props.Images from the room where the men are said to have been shot show blood-spattered floors and walls with a bloodied, blue pillow with a bullet hole in it on a bed."They executed the three men as they slept in the room," the hospital's director, Dr Naji Nazzal, told Reuters. "They executed them in cold blood by firing bullets directly into their heads in the room where they were being treated."The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the guardian of the Geneva Conventions which codify international humanitarian law, has expressed concern over the raid. "Under international humanitarian law, hospitals and medical patients should be respected and protected at all times", the ICRC said, adding that it would raise the issue "as part of its confidential dialogue with the concerned authorities".Tensions have soared in the West Bank since the 7 October attacks, with near daily Israeli arrest raids and clashes with Palestinians. Jenin, a militant stronghold, has been a focus of such raids for months.Since 7 October, Israeli forces have killed at least 357 Palestinians - militants, civilians and attackers - in the West Bank, while Israeli settlers have killed at least eight, according to the United Nations.Palestinians from the West Bank have killed at least 10 Israelis in attacks in the West Bank and Israel in the same period.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the Hamas suspect who was killed had "planned a raid attack inspired by the October 7th massacre". On that date, waves of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel from Gaza, killed about 1,300 people - mainly civilians - and took about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages.The attack triggered Israel's military campaign in Gaza, with the declared aim of destroying Hamas. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 26,600 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed in the Israeli offensive.The official Palestinian news agency in the West Bank, Wafa, said the three Palestinians in the hospital had been "assassinated".According to its sources in the hospital, about 10 members of Israeli special forces dressed in civilian clothes went to the third floor, where they killed the men using weapons fitted with silencers.Dr Naji Nazzal said one of the men, who PIJ identified as its member, had been receiving treatment at the hospital since 25 October for a spinal injury which had left him paralysed.	
30/01/2024 10:24:00	What is South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ? - BBC News	The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel rejects the allegations as "baseless". South Africa brought the case to the court. The ICJ is the top court of the United Nations (UN).Based in the Hague, in the Netherlands, it was established after World War Two, to settle disputes between states.It also gives advisory opinions on legal matters, which is what it is being asked to do with Israel. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide.But its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions.South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, following Hamas's 7 October attack. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza.Since Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas in response, more than 26,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Evidence submitted by South Africa claims "acts and omissions" by Israel "are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group". This describes what Israel is actively doing, such as carrying out air strikes, and what it is allegedly failing to do, such as, according to South Africa, preventing harm to civilians. The case also highlights Israeli public rhetoric, including comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of "genocidal intent". Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Those acts are: Israel fiercely rejected South Africa's claim. Mr Netanyahu said: "It is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas. "It would murder all of us if it could. "In contrast, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is acting as morally as possible."Israel's military says it takes a raft of measures to avoid civilian casualties. These have included:The Israeli government has repeatedly stated its intention is to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people.The court issued what it called "emergency measures" on 26 January. This was a hearing to rule on a number of interim steps which South Africa had asked it to take against Israel.The key request was for the court to order Israel to immediately halt operations in Gaza, but the court did not uphold this.However, it did instruct Israel to prevent its military from committing acts which might be considered genocidal, to prevent and punish incitement to genocide, and to enable humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. The court also ruled that it had the legal right to proceed with the genocide case. A final verdict though could take several years.Rulings are legally binding on countries which formally accept the ICJ - these include Israel and South Africa - but in practice, unenforceable by the court. In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to "immediately suspend military operations" in Ukraine - but the order was ignored.South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza.And as a signatory to the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention, it has an obligation to act, it says.The governing African National Congress also has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause.It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994.The country condemned the 7 October attacks and called for the release of the hostages."Our opposition to the ongoing slaughter of the people of Gaza has driven us as a country to approach the ICJ," said President Cyril Ramaphosa. "As a people who once tasted the bitter fruits of dispossession, discrimination, racism and state-sponsored violence, we are clear that we will stand on the right side of history."Additional reporting by Damian Zane.	
30/01/2024 02:09:00	Israel-Gaza war: Counting the destruction of religious sites - BBC News	Gaza is home to some of the oldest churches and mosques in the world, but many have not escaped the widespread destruction of Israel's military offensive.Of 117 religious sites which were reportedly damaged or destroyed between 7 October, when Israel's campaign began, and 31 December, the BBC has verified 74 cases. Seventy-two are mosques and two are churches. Israel's offensive was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on 7 October. In its investigation, the BBC used satellite imagery and user generated content to examine evidence from both before and after buildings were hit.In a statement, Hamas - the Palestinian Islamist group which rules Gaza - said 378 mosques and three churches had been hit up to 9 January, though this figure has not been independently verified.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says Hamas fighters are using places of worship for cover and as places from which to launch attacks - something Hamas denies.Believed to be one of the oldest churches in the world, St Porphyrius is one of a handful dotted around the Gaza Strip. Many of the territory's small Christian population, which before the war numbered about 1,000, has a strong connection to the land. St Porphyrius was a 5th Century bishop in Gaza whose tomb lies under the church.Like many Palestinian Christians, Marian Saba and her family sought refuge within the church grounds, believing they would be safe. But on 19 October, as the night drew in, an Israeli missile hit one of the church's outer buildings, killing 18 people and injuring many more. Marian said her 34-year-old brother-in-law Soliman was killed as he shielded his son from a collapsing wall. "It was a horrifying scene. I have never seen a dead body. I didn't know what to say," she said. "It was an immediate death." Rami Tarazi was in one of the church's halls at the time of the blast. "It was a rocket missile that was so big even the people who were in the other hall came out in white dust," he said of the explosion, which did not impact the main building."We pulled out 16 people in pieces and two full corpses," he vividly recalls. One of the people killed was Rami's 36-year-old cousin Suliman, who Rami says had been "talking and laughing" with him just an hour earlier.  According to international humanitarian law, intentionally targeting religious buildings during conflict is a war crime. There is an exception, however, if such sites are being used for military purposes. Videos uploaded by the IDF to social media show soldiers entering religious buildings it has targeted and showing underground tunnels it says were used by Hamas. In this case, the IDF told the BBC that the church was not the intended target of the strike despite its grounds being hit as a result. It said the incident was under review.Some videos and photos being shared online also purport to show Israeli soldiers disrespecting the sanctity of religious places and glorifying destruction. One image seen on X, formerly known as Twitter, shows an Israeli soldier posing in front of a fallen minaret which has been graffitied in Hebrew with the words "the temple will be rebuilt" - a reference to a belief that a third Jewish temple will be built on the contested holy site in Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif or the al-Aqsa Mosque compound.The IDF said the behaviour of the soldier in the image was "severe and not in accordance with the IDF's values", adding that it was investigating the incident.Dr Georgia Andreou from the Institute of Archaeology at University College London has been looking into the destruction of heritage sites in the Gaza Strip. She says many holy sites have great historical significance, and that the destruction of sacred, as well as heritage, sites in Gaza is "the worst I have ever seen".Many of the mosques in Gaza have been razed, and unlike those who take shelter in churches, Palestinian Muslims are choosing to seek refuge away from their places of worship.In Khan Younis, the BBC verified that Khalil Al-Rahman mosque, which had reportedly been hit in an air strike in the area, had been damaged.As a devout Muslim, Renad Alaa al-Bataa frequented this mosque, where she learnt to memorise the Quran. But since the war started she has not been back. "Previously, the IDF seldom targeted mosques unless there were alleged militant targets. But this time, they've destroyed several beautiful mosques that nurtured us and taught us about our religion," she said. During a week-long truce that took place in November, she says, the muezzin - the person who makes the call to prayer - devised a makeshift minaret and began calling for prayers five times a day from the top of what remains of Khalil Al-Rahman mosque. She says it brought her a sense of security that ended when Israel resumed fighting against Hamas. One of the starkest images of destruction to emerge from Khan Younis is a video that shows the sudden and quick flattening of Khalid bin Al-Waleed mosque. It has been viewed nearly 15m times on X.According to Chris Partridge, a weapons analyst for the BBC, the video appears to show a precision guided bomb that has been dropped from an aircraft hitting the mosque before it erupts into a cloud of flames and smoke. The clue in the choice of munition, he says, is its precision. It is unclear how many of the religious sites we have verified have been destroyed by the IDF or how many have been used by Hamas. However, the IDF says it is acting in accordance with international law to dismantle Hamas's military and administrative capabilities and taking precautions to mitigate civilian harm. The BBC asked the IDF whether it had struck both Khalil bin Al-Rahman and Khalid bin Al-Waleed mosque. A spokesperson said they had struck sites "which Hamas used for terrorist purposes", without specifying. Amid the destruction of many of Gaza's places of worship, faith has increasingly become a spiritual safety blanket for many Palestinians running away from death. Marian Saba and her family continue to shelter at St Porphyrius Church with approximately 300 others, attending Sunday Mass weekly. Nine days after it was damaged, her daughter Kylie was baptised. She described it as a bittersweet moment. What should have been a joyous occasion was anxiously brought forward by the fear that her child might be killed without one. In a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah, Renad Alaa al-Bataa is far from her home and mosque in Khan Younis. Instagram is now her diary, with nostalgia often taking over, as she posts photos of her old life, including her time as a dentistry student.But she says the Quran, which she reads daily, is her place of solace: "It lessens the heaviness of the night. If only you knew how hard the nights in Gaza are."Additional reporting by Mehdi Musawi	
29/01/2024 23:53:00	Three US soldiers killed in Jordan attack named - BBC News	The US government has released the names of three troops killed by an enemy drone attack in Jordan on Sunday. Sgt William Jerome Rivers, 46, Specialist Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, and Specialist Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23, were killed when a drone hit their housing unit.The US has blamed Iranian-backed groups and the Pentagon said it carried the "footprints" of Kataib Hezbollah.The Pentagon also reiterated the US does not want a war with Iran."We don't seek war, but we will take action, and respond to attacks on our forces," said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, said it was told by a US official that the drone used in the attack appeared to be Iranian-made. The official indicated it was a "type of Shahed drone," which is a one-way attack drone Iran has been providing to Russia.Iran has denied US and British accusations that it supported militant groups blamed for the strike.The Pentagon said the three soldiers killed on Sunday morning came from an army reserve unit based in Fort Moore, in the state of Georgia.Lt Gen Jody Daniels, Chief of Army Reserve and Commanding General US Army Reserve Command, paid tribute to the fallen soldiers. "On behalf of the Army Reserve, I share in the sorrow felt by their friends, family, and loved ones. Their service and sacrifice will not be forgotten, and we are committed to supporting those left behind in the wake of this tragedy", said Gen Daniels.The drone attack took place in Rukban, north-eastern Jordan, near the Syrian border. The base was later named by US officials as Tower 22. More than 40 military personnel were injured when the unmanned aerial system hit the container housing unit they were in on Sunday morning. Features of an air defence system were turned off at Tower 22 at the time of the attack, US officials told CBS News, because the enemy drone arrived at the same time as a returning US drone.They added that troops at the air base were still in their sleeping quarters when the drone struck - with little to no warning.Iran has denied playing a part in supporting groups suspected of being responsible for the strike.Nasser Kanaani, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, said it was "not involved in the decision making of resistance groups" in how they chose to "defend Palestinians or their own countries".Iran's Intelligence Minister Esmail Khatib said that regional armed groups aligned with Iran respond to "American aggressors" at their own discretion.US President Joe Biden said the US "will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing".The US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said he and Mr Biden would take "all necessary actions" following the attack on American forces. Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said the attack was carried out by an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-backed militia and had the "footprints" of Iraq-based militant group Kataib Hezbollah. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed it was behind the attack.The umbrella group emerged in late 2023 and is comprised of several Iran-affiliated militias operating in Iraq. It has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks.In a statement, the group said it had targeted three US bases in Syria - identifying them as Shaddadi, Tanf and Rukban. However, Rukban is on the Jordanian side of the border with Syria. The group also said it targeted an Israeli oil facility in the Mediterranean.It is the first time that a strike has killed US troops in the region since the start of the war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.There have been other attacks on US bases in the region, but before Sunday there were no fatalities, according to the US military.Officials said that US sites in Iraq and Syria had been attacked at least 165 times since 17 October. Last month, the US carried out airstrikes against Iran-affiliated groups after three US servicemembers were injured, one critically, in a drone attack on a base in northern Iraq.Earlier in January, one retaliatory US strike in Baghdad killed a militia leader accused of being behind attacks on US personnel. 	
29/01/2024 22:12:00	Iranian hired Hells Angel to kill defector, US says - BBC News	US authorities have charged three men with plotting to murder an Iranian defector living in Maryland.Naji Sharifi Zindashti, 49, who lives in Iran, allegedly asked Canadian Damion Ryan to help with an assassination.Mr Ryan, a member of the Hells Angels motorcycle club, then enlisted associate Adam Pearson, who is currently in prison.They are also accused of targeting the defector's female companion. Mr Zindashti - who US and UK officials say operates a criminal network targeting Iranian dissidents around the world on behalf of the Iranian government - agreed to pay Mr Ryan, 43, and Pearson, 29, a total of $350,000 (£275,000) plus $20,000 (£15,750) in travel expenses for the murder-for-hire, according to an indictment released Monday.The group communicated on an encrypted chat app, SkyECC, which has been implicated in a number of organised crime cases. The company that produced the app, Sky Global, was seized by US authorities in 2021. It is not related to media conglomerate Sky Group Limited.Mr Zindashti, who lives in Iran, messaged Mr Ryan about "jobs" and starting in January 2021 they began talking about a specific plot in the US, according to the indictment.Mr Ryan talked about shooting the victim in the head and wrote that he would ensure his operatives would know that "we gotta erase his head from his torso".He said he had assembled a team of four people including Pearson, a Canadian who was living illegally in Minnesota at the time. The plot was apparently never carried out and alleged targets in Maryland were not named in the indictment. The three men were charged with conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years if no death or injuries occur. In addition, Pearson faces firearms charges. Also on Monday, the US and UK governments announced sanctions on Mr Zindashti and his associates. Reports say Mr Zindashti has been arrested several times in Iran and Turkey on drug charges. In 2014, his daughter was killed by rivals in a gang dispute. He is believed to now live in Iran and US officials say he organizes assassinations of dissidents and drug-smuggling operations on behalf of the Iranian government. Turkish officials believe his network was behind the abduction of Habib Chaab, a Swedish-Iranian activist who was kidnapped during a visit to Turkey in 2020 and was later executed in Iran."The Iranian regime's continued efforts to target dissidents and activists demonstrate the regime's deep insecurity and attempt to expand Iran's domestic repression internationally," said Brian Nelson, US Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.The BBC contacted Iran's ministry of foreign affairs for comment.Mr Ryan and Pearson are currently in prison in Canada on charges unrelated to the alleged murder-for-hire.Mr Ryan is awaiting trial on drugs and weapons charges. Canadian authorities allege he was involved in an international drug-smuggling operation. Pearson pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of a man in Alberta and was sentenced last year to eight years in prison. 	
29/01/2024 21:30:00	UNRWA: Gaza aid agency says it is 'extremely desperate' after funding halted - BBC News	More countries have halted funding to the largest UN agency operating in Gaza, as the crisis deepens over the alleged role of some staff in the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel.Japan and Austria said they were suspending payments to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.The US, UK, Germany and Italy are also among those who have suspended funding.UNRWA has told the BBC it is "extremely desperate" and that "the humanitarian needs in Gaza are growing by the hour".The agency has sacked several of its staff over allegations they were involved on 7 October, when Hamas gunmen infiltrated Israel, killing about 1,300 people - mainly civilians - and taking about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages.More than 26,000 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a major military operation in response, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says. Another 1.7 million people have fled their homes, with many of them sheltering at UNRWA facilities.According to a report in the New York Times, an Israeli intelligence dossier alleges that nearly 200 UNRWA workers are Hamas or Islamic Jihad operatives, without providing detailed evidence. The dossier also alleges that at least 12 workers crossed into Israel on 7 October. UNRWA has sacked nine of those employees and says it is investigating.Another report published by the Wall Street Journal, also citing the Israeli intelligence dossier, alleges that about 1,200 of UNRWA's 12,000 employees in Gaza have links to Hamas or Islamic Jihad. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to confirm the contents of the dossier, describing the agency as "perforated with Hamas"."We discovered that there were 13 UNRWA workers who actually participated, either directly or indirectly, in the 7 October massacre," he said in an interview with UK channel TalkTV. "In UNRWA schools, they've been teaching the doctrines of extermination for Israel - the doctrines of terrorism, glorifying terrorism, lauding terrorism."The UN has declined to comment, saying an internal investigation into the agency is under way.But earlier on Sunday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was "horrified" by the accusations relating to the 7 October attack. Despite that, he has appealed to donor countries to "guarantee the continuity of UNRWA's operations".In a statement on Sunday, he said: "Of the 12 people implicated, nine were immediately identified and terminated by the Commissioner-General of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini; one is confirmed dead and the identity of the two others is being clarified."He said Gaza should not be penalised for the allegations.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the reports about UNRWA staff were "deeply troubling" and it was "imperative" for the organisation to investigate in order to hold people to account and review its procedures.But he said that UNRWA played an "absolutely indispensable role in trying to make sure that men, women and children who so desperately need assistance in Gaza actually get it" and added it was therefore imperative that the organisation's role continues.Earlier on Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said he had cancelled meetings with Mr Lazzarini and called on him to resign.An UNRWA spokesperson said that if funding was not resumed, the agency would not be able to continue its operations beyond the end of February.Announcing its decision to suspend payment, Japan's foreign ministry said late on Sunday that it was "extremely concerned about the alleged involvement of UNRWA staff members in the terror attack on Israel".It added that it had been "strongly urging" UNRWA to investigate the allegations "in a prompt and complete manner".Japan is the sixth-largest donor to the agency, according to UNRWA's 2022 figures.On Monday, Austria said it was following suit, calling for "a comprehensive, swift and complete investigation into the allegations".Juliette Touma, the director of communications at UNRWA, said in a BBC interview that the allegations were "extremely serious" and that Mr Lazzarini had taken an "extraordinary measure" in immediately dismissing the staff members in question."We are extremely desperate. It has come at a time when the humanitarian needs in Gaza are growing by the hour," she said, adding that she had visited the territory herself last week."People continue to be displaced. People are hungry. The clock is ticking fast towards famine. "We are doing everything possible to avert us from getting towards famine. But this lack of funding that we have been faced with now, when at least 10 of the largest donors have put a temporary pause on the funding, this is going to have very, very serious repercussions on what is, right now, the largest humanitarian operation in Gaza."She said UNRWA had not seen the evidence, but the allegations were being investigated by the UN's oversight office in New York.	
29/01/2024 19:29:00	Jordan base attack: What options does US have to respond? - BBC News	Washington now finds itself facing a dilemma. President Joe Biden has promised a strong response to Sunday's deadly attack on a US military base in Jordan. But the challenge for the US is to find the right balance between deterrence and escalation. Fail to act decisively and it risks sending a message of weakness that will only encourage more attacks. Act too forcefully and it could trigger an escalatory response from Iran and its allies.So what are the options? And how does this work?The US will already have a number of "on-the-shelf" military options to choose from. These have been drawn up by the US Department of Defense with intelligence input from the CIA and the National Security Agency. They are then presented to the US National Security Council and policymakers, with the president making the final decision and signing off on the chosen course. This is the most obvious choice and one that has been used in the past. There are a large number of bases, weapons stores and training depots across Iraq and Syria belonging to the myriad of Iran-backed militias. These militias are trained, equipped and funded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, but not necessarily directed by them. The US knows who they are and where they are. It could easily carry out more precision-guided missile strikes on these bases - but this has so far failed to deter the militias, who have launched more than 170 attacks on US bases in the region since 7 October.Responsibility for the attack has been claimed by a group calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. This is an umbrella term for a number of Iran-backed militias, some of which, ironically, have previously fought on the same side as the US against their common enemy in the region: Islamic State. They share common aims with Iran, namely to drive the US military from Iraq and Syria and to punish the US for its military support of Israel.This would be a massive escalation and not something the US would consider lightly. It is highly unlikely, although not inconceivable, that the US retaliation would include hitting targets on Iranian sovereign territory. Neither Washington nor Tehran want to get into a full-scale war and both have said so. Iran's response could well include attempting to close the economically vital Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world's oil and gas flow. This would have a devastating effect on world economies, driving up prices and almost certainly damaging President Biden's chances of re-election in November.One alternative is to go after senior IRGC commanders in Iraq or Syria. There is a precedent for this, the most notable being four years ago when then-President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike that killed the IRGC Quds Force commander Qassim Suleimani in Baghdad in 2020. But this too would be seen as an escalation, and could well trigger a dangerous response from Tehran.There are those in the US establishment who argue that, given the current tensions in the Middle East, it would be irresponsible for Washington to hit Iranian interests now, especially in an election year. CENTCOM, the part of the US Department of Defense that covers the Middle East, already has its hands full combatting the Houthis' attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. It will also be listening to pleas from US allies around the region not to trigger a wider Middle East conflict.But this view is likely to be outweighed by those who say that the US policy of deterrence to date has failed, and that Washington's reluctance to hit back hard at those who attack its bases has only encouraged them to step up their attacks.There is a time factor in all of this - some would argue that a radical uptick in US military responses may not be necessary or worthwhile in the long term. First, attacks by Iran-backed militias pre-date the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza - but they have dramatically increased since 7 October. Once Israel's assault on Gaza concludes then tensions in the region may well subside, although Israel warns this could still be months away. Secondly, there are loud calls by some in Washington for the US to decrease its military footprint in the Middle East. President Trump, when he was in office, had to be persuaded by his military and intelligence chiefs not to pull out all US forces from Syria, where they were helping Kurdish forces stop ISIS from returning. There is a strong possibility that should Trump return to the White House in a year's time, then Iran will get its way anyhow, if he decides to draw down the US presence in Iraq and Syria.	
29/01/2024 17:25:00	US drone attack: Death of US troops ratchets up pressure on Biden - BBC News	The death of three US servicemen and injuring of many others, turns up the heat in an already febrile region and ratchets up the pressure on the US commander-in-chief, President Joe Biden. This marks the first time American troops have been killed by enemy fire since the Israel-Gaza war erupted. And it may be the first time during this current crisis that Washington has to take such a hard look at such a difficult decision: where and how should it strike Iran?  Washington will want to send the strongest of messages to Tehran, which it blames for the fires now burning everywhere from Lebanon to Yemen. But it will also want to avoid sparking an even more dangerous escalatory spiral of strikes and counterstrikes.  This moment seems to have been all but inevitable. Since mid-October, US military installations in Iraq and Syria have repeatedly come under attack by Iran-backed militias, injuring a growing number of US soldiers. The US has retaliated, at least eight times, by hitting targets in both countries. It was only a matter of time before American lives were lost on this low-intensity, but high-risk, battlefield.  In his first response, President Biden left no doubt where the blame lies this time. The drone attack on Tower 22, a small outpost along Jordan's border with Syria, was the work of "radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq."Iran has shot back, denying any responsibility. Referring to what Tehran calls "resistance groups," a foreign ministry spokesman insisted "they do not take commands (from Iran) in their decisions and actions about how to support Palestine."  Iran's allies across this region have all been trained and armed by its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) or been instructed on how to arm themselves. This web of contacts has tightened in recent years in their so-called "axis of resistance" and the Israel-Gaza conflict has visibly strengthened this military alliance of radical non-state actors. But each actor has its agency, its own agendas and ambitions. In Iraq, most of the assaults appear to have been carried out by groups aligned in the umbrella grouping, named the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. Retaliatory strikes are complicated by the fact that some are also part of Iraq's own armed forces.  In recent months, the US has aimed fire at Iranian assets in the region, including what was described as a training base in Syria and an IRGC weapons depot. This time, the target will have to be the kind of "high value" one which hurts Iran far more - to prove Washington's mettle in this region, and, just as importantly, at home. In an election year, President Biden's political adversaries are already exploiting this crisis to reiterate their charge that he is "soft on Iran." "It's very tricky, very difficult," analyst Fawaz Gerges, Professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science told the BBC. "All scenarios have consequences." In a range of options, striking Iran itself is the riskiest of all. It would be the first attack on Iranian soil since a bungled plot in 1980 to rescue American hostages seized in the wake of the Iranian revolution. The last highly sensitive US operation against Iran was the assassination four years ago of top IRGC commander Qasem Soleimani, who was cut down by an American drone strike in Baghdad. He was accused of plotting to kill American diplomats and soldiers across the region and had been a pivotal figure in forging this "axis of resistance"."There has to be deterrent like the Soleimani attack," underlined Joel Rayburn, a former US Special Envoy to Syria, who spoke to the BBC's Newshour programme. "If a cost is not imposed on the Iranian mastermind these attacks will go on and on."Iran, also under significant pressures at home, has held back in recent months from its own strikes on Israeli or American sites in retaliation for the assassination of several of its senior Revolutionary Guard commanders, which it blames on Israel. Earlier this month, in its first direct reply, it focused its fire on what was regarded as a "soft target" when it hit what it called a base of Israel's Mossad agency in Iraqi Kurdistan. The US knows it now has to be seen to be doing something, but even more it has to be seen to succeed. That's the dilemma for Washington and its allies as the devastating Israel-Gaza war drags on, causing a staggering number of civilian casualties and untold suffering. Iran's allies insist they won't cease fire until there's a ceasefire in Gaza; so far, none is in sight as Israel wages a war it says will only end once Hamas is destroyed and hostages are freed.Tensions on another front, in the vital shipping lanes of the Red Sea, tell a cautionary tale. The US, backed by the UK and others, already finds itself leading a military campaign against Yemen's Houthis, but it hasn't stopped their attacks on vessels sailing through this passage so pivotal to world trade.It has only intensified Houthi defiance and catapulted them to the centre of world attention. A recent Western intelligence estimate put Houthi losses at about 30% of their arsenal. But the Houthis, masters of irregular warfare after surviving nearly a decade of Saudi-led airstrikes, believe they're winning far more than they're losing. The Houthis, and others in their Iran-backed alliance, have seized on this crisis to try to burnish their reputation as standard bearers for the Palestinians in their battles against Israel. While the Gaza war rages, the US looks set for a long struggle to extinguish multiple fires blazing all at once, and keep them from burning out of control.  	
29/01/2024 17:24:00	US drone attack: What is Tower 22 and why are US troops in Jordan? - BBC News	An Iran-backed militia group has said it was responsible for a drone strike at a US military base in Jordan that killed three American troops.At least 34 other service members were injured in the attack at the base, known as Tower 22. The White House blamed Iran and vowed a "very consequential response".But Iran called the accusation "baseless" and said it was "not involved in the decision-making of resistance groups".US officials have sought for weeks to prevent high tensions on several fronts in the region from boiling over into a wider war.But Sunday marked the first time US soldiers had been killed by enemy fire in the region since Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.The attack targeted a US military base known as Tower 22 in north-eastern Jordan, near the Syrian border.A defence official told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the enemy drone came in "very low and very slow" at the same time that an American drone was returning to the base from a mission.The auto-response features of the base's air defence system were turned off so as not to shoot down the US drone, the official said.As a result, there was little to no warning for troops stationed at Tower 22, who were reportedly still in their sleeping quarters when the drone arrived.There are about 350 US forces stationed at the base, conducting key functions including supporting the coalition to defeat Islamic State, according to US Central Command (CentCom).Among those injured, eight service members were medically evacuated from Jordan to receive higher-level care, but they are in stable condition, CentCom said.The base which was hit in a deadly drone attack in a north-west corner of Jordan is one of more than a dozen where US military personnel operate across Iraq, Jordan and Syria.In recent months, these bases - ranging in size from a military outpost such as Tower 22, which was hit in Jordan, to al-Asad air base in western Iraq - have been attacked by militias trained, funded and equipped by Iran.There are about 3,000 US troops based in Jordan, a key US ally, and 2,500 in Iraq - there at the invitation of the Iraqi government as part of a US-led coalition to prevent a resurgence of the jihadist Islamic State group, which still has a presence there after being routed in 2017.There are also about 900 US personnel in Syria, officially there to support its anti-IS ally the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in Syria's semi-autonomous north-east region. The Syria government opposes the US presence in its country, calling it an occupation.The US also maintains many more bases further afield across the Middle East, including three major air bases in the Gulf and a port in Bahrain which serves as the headquarters of the US Naval Forces Central Command and the US Fifth Fleet.The Islamic Resistance in Iraq said it was responsible for the attack in a statement posted to Telegram on Sunday.It said it targeted three US bases in Syria and Jordan - Shaddadi, Rukban and Tanf - as well as an Israeli oil facility in the Mediterranean.The group emerged in late 2023, right after the beginning of Israel's bombardment in Gaza in response to Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October.It consists of several Iran-affiliated militias operating in Iraq and has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks."Islamic Resistance in Iraq" is believed to be an umbrella term for various Shia militia groups such as Kataib Hezbollah, Nujaba and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada, that have a long history of targeting US bases in Iraq and Syria.Tehran refers to its networks of proxies and allied groups in the region as the "Axis of Resistance", a kind of forward defence against its enemies.The point of creating these ghost groups is to make it difficult for Washington to pin the attacks on a specific culprit.President Joe Biden said the "despicable and wholly unjust" attacks on Sunday had been carried out by "radical Iran-backed militant groups".He also vowed the US "will hold all those responsible to account at a time and manner of our choosing".All eyes are now on the White House, which is under pressure to respond forcefully to the attack, with some lawmakers and current and former officials calling for strikes against Iranian targets.Mr Biden's dilemma is how to retaliate, who to hit and where to hit. The big question is whether the US can deter attacks by hitting back hard or whether it will add fuel to a growing fire in the region.Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East, told the BBC he believes that the US should respond with "more force than we have used to date"."It's been clear that the US does not want this war in Gaza to expand in the region. It's also been clear that Iran does want it to expand," he said. "The only thing they understand is force. It's time to use it."He added: "I believe that even targets inside Iran are being included as options to the White House from the Pentagon."UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has urged Iran to de-escalate tensions in the region.	
29/01/2024 13:55:00	Iran denies involvement in drone strike that killed three US troops - BBC News	Iran has denied involvement in a drone attack on a US base near Jordan's border with Syria that killed three US troops.The US blamed the attack, which also left dozens injured, on "radical Iranian-backed militant groups".US President Biden vowed revenge and said: "We shall respond."It is the first time that a strike has killed US troops in the region since the start of the war in Gaza triggered by Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.There have been other attacks on US bases in the region, but before Sunday there were no fatalities, according to the US military.The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed it was behind the attack.The umbrella group emerged in late 2023 and is comprised of several Iran-affiliated militias operating in Iraq. It has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks.In a statement, the group said it had targeted three US bases in Syria - identifying them as Shaddadi, Tanf and Rukban. However, Rukban is on the Jordanian side of the border with Syria. The group also said it targeted an Israeli oil facility in the Mediterranean.The BBC's US partner CBS reported that US troops were in their sleeping quarters when the drone struck their Tower 22 base in the early hours of the morning.A defence official said the drone came in "very low and very slow" at the same time that a US drone was returning to the base from a mission.As a result, the auto-response features of the air defence system were turned off so as not to shoot down the US drone, the official said, which meant there was little to no warning for troops at the base.The Iraqi government has condemned the attack and called for "an end to the cycle of violence" in the Middle East.Iraqi government spokesman Bassem al-Awadi said it was willing "to collaborate on establishing fundamental rules to prevent further repercussions in the region and curb the escalation of conflict".Mr Biden said the US "will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing".On Monday White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the US was seeking a "very consequential" response to the attack but does not want a wider war with Iran or the region.The administration believed a single drone was used to target US troops in Jordan, Mr Kirby said.Iran denied US and British accusations that it supported militant groups blamed for the strike.Nasser Kanaani, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, said it was "not involved in the decision making of resistance groups" in how they chose to "defend Palestinians or their own countries".Iran's intelligence minister Esmail Khatib said that regional armed groups aligned with Iran respond to "American aggressors" at their own discretion.The White House said Mr Biden was briefed about the attack on Sunday morning by US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and other officials."Jill and I join the families and friends of our fallen - and Americans across the country - in grieving the loss of these warriors in this despicable and wholly unjust attack," Mr Biden said in a statement.The names of the servicemen killed and injured have not yet been released as officials work to notify their families.UK Prime Minister ​Rishi Sunak condemned the attack and urged Iran to "continue to de-escalate tensions" in the region. "We stand resolutely with our allies to bring stability and peace to the region," he said.Downing Street echoed the US assessment and said it believed "the attack was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq".US officials said at least 34 military personnel were being evaluated for possible traumatic brain injury, and that some of the injured soldiers were medically evacuated from the base for further treatment.They also said the drone struck living quarters at the base, which, if confirmed, could explain the high number of casualties.US Central Command and President Biden said the attack was on a base in Rukban, northeastern Jordan, near the Syrian border. It was later named by US officials as Tower 22. In December, US officials said that US bases in Iraq and Syria had been attacked at least 97 times since 17 October. Last month, the US carried out airstrikes against Iran-affiliated groups after three US servicemembers were injured, one critically, in a drone attack on a base in northern Iraq.Earlier in January, one retaliatory US strike in Baghdad killed a militia leader accused of being behind attacks on US personnel. In a pre-recorded interview with ABC News that aired on Sunday morning, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen CQ Brown said that America's aim in the region is to "not have the conflict broaden"."The goal is to deter them and we don't want to go down a path of greater escalation that drives to a much broader conflict within the region."US and coalition troops are also stationed in the Red Sea after the Iran-backed Houthis began attacking commercial ships in the region. The Yemen-based group says it is targeting vessels in the region in support of Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel is fighting Hamas.The US military has previously said "these unlawful actions have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza"."The Houthis have fired indiscriminately into the Red Sea, targeting vessels impacting over 40 countries around the world," US Central Command has said.Two Navy Seals are presumed dead after they went missing in January during an operation off the coast of Somalia to seize Iranian-made weapons bound for Houthis in Yemen. 	
29/01/2024 11:04:00	Worthing man running length of Africa secures Algerian visa - BBC News	A man running the length of Africa has secured the visa needed to continue his challenge.Russell Cook, from Worthing, West Sussex, had planned to complete the length of 360 marathons in 240 days.After visa complications, the 26-year-old previously said the challenge was dependent on whether he could secure permission to cross the border into Algeria from Mauritania.The UK's Algerian embassy said he will receive a courtesy visa on the spot."You will get a multi-entry visa to allow you to cross Algeria through the province of Tindouf in order to pursue your charitable mission," the embassy said on X, formerly Twitter."Welcome to Algeria and good luck."On day 283 of the challenge, Mr Cook, nicknamed "Hardest Geezer", said: "Boys and girls we did it. We're going to Algeria."There is still over 4,000km of running left to do, but I'll have a finish date for Project Africa ready to announce pretty soon. Daiquiris on the beach in sight."The extreme challenge began at South Africa's most southerly point on 22 April and will finish at Tunisia's most northerly point.Mr Cook had originally aimed to cover 9,320 miles (14,500km) during the challenge, crossing 16 borders, but extended the mission due to complications with his visas, health scares, geopolitical issues and an armed robbery.Last week, he said it was "game over" if he could not secure the visa into Algeria."I've been on the road for 278 days, ran 12,000km [7,456 miles] across 13 different countries, raised over £140,000 for charity - but it is all hanging in the balance," he said.Conservative MP for East Worthing Tim Loughton and Alexander Stafford MP previously offered to help by raising the issue with the Algerian Embassy, the Foreign Office and the Algerian ambassador.The challenge is in aid of The Running Charity and has raised £149,389 so far.Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

29/01/2024 23:55:00	Jordan drone strike: Pentagon to hold briefing as US considers response to attack - BBC News		
29/01/2024 06:20:00	St Patrick's Day: SDLP leader to boycott White House celebrations - BBC News	SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has said he "cannot in good conscience" attend the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations because of the US response to the Israel-Gaza war.Instead, the SDLP will send a delegation to Washington "to make the case for an end to violence".Hamas killed about 1,300 people in attacks on Israel on 7 October.  More than 26,000 Palestinians have died in Israel's retaliatory attacks, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says.More than 240 Israelis were taken hostage on 7 October; about 130 remain missing, believed to be being held in Gaza. Mr Eastwood described the response of the international community to the conflict as "heinously deficient".The US administration's response was "particularly atrocious", he added. "The scenes of destruction and annihilation in Gaza represent, in my view, a clear act of genocide," he said, in a statement.Last week, judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel must take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza.The ICJ delivered the interim ruling in South Africa's genocide case against Israel, but the UN's top court stopped short of ordering an immediate ceasefire.On Sunday, Irish Justice Minister Helen McEntee voiced support for Ireland joining South Africa's challenge, but acknowledged the Irish government needed time to study all aspects of the case."Personally I would like us to," she told RTÉ Radio One."I am very much aware that we need to do so on a correct legal basis. I mean, what you are doing essentially is accusing another country of genocide. You need to know the facts."Following the interim ruling, Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin said the government would "strongly consider" an intervention in South Africa's case and he has asked his legal team to produce a report.He added there will be engagement with "like-minded countries" on this.Mr Eastwood said Ireland and the US have "forged one of the warmest and most enduring international relationships", and it is because of this he believes there is a "duty to be honest with our friends... especially when we think they're wrong".He added: "I could not rub shoulders, drink Guinness, and have the craic while the horrifying impacts of the brutal war in Gaza continue. It would be the very opposite of solidarity with a people on the brink of destruction."Politicians from the island of Ireland traditionally visit Washington DC for the 17 March celebrations, with the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) hosted by the US president in the White House. Mr Eastwood said each political leader "will have to take their own decision on how they approach St Patrick's Day"."I am offering no criticism of anyone else," he added."There is no easy answer to any of this."Some Irish politicians have been urged by pro-Palestinian activists to boycott this year's Washington event over US support for Israel.Last week, Sinn Féin's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said her party would not boycott the trip. Instead they intend to use it to advocate for an end to violence.The party had previously called for the expulsion of Israel's ambassador to Ireland, but the motion was rejected in the Irish parliament."We are going to the US in pursuit of peace, continuing to work with the Irish diaspora and US representatives to promote and strengthen the support for the peace process at home and Irish reunification," Ms O'Neill told the PA news agency."We will also advocate for an end to the Israeli genocidal war and occupation in Gaza and the West Bank, for the establishment of a peace process in Palestine and self-determination for the Palestinian people. "In doing so, we will fulfil our promise to the Palestinian ambassador and the Palestinian people."Mr Martin has also said it would be inappropriate to boycott the celebrations."The idea that Ireland would just retreat from any engagement to me doesn't make sense," he said.The Irish government will persist in its dialogue and engagement with other nations, he added, with an aim of escalating international pressure and bringing an end to the violence in the Middle East.Meanwhile, the Irish government has said there are "no plans" to suspend funding for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.It comes after the agency announced the sacking of several of its staff over allegations they were involved in the 7 October Hamas attacks.In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Martin said he has "full confidence" in the agency's commission-general and its internal investigation.The Republic of Ireland provided the agency with €18m (£15.4m) in 2023 and "will continue our support in 2024", Mr Martin added.The UK government, which paused funding on Saturday, said it was "appalled" by Israel's allegations.The US, Australia, Italy, Canada, Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France and Germany have also suspended additional funding to the agency.Mr Martin told RTÉ News he believes those countries acted "prematurely" and that an entire population should not be punished because of the alleged actions of some workers.Created in 1949, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, is the biggest UN agency operating in Gaza.It provides health care, education and other humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. It employs about 13,000 people inside Gaza.	
29/01/2024 06:00:00	Death in the Channel - what led a 14-year-old boy to make fatal journey? - BBC News	On the night he drowned, 14-year-old Obada Abd Rabbo was having doubts once again."I can't swim," he kept telling the men around him, as they shuffled down the wet slipway in the pitch dark, towards the icy waves.Obada's older brother, Ayser, 24, clutched his hand. This was the third time since leaving Syria nine months earlier that they had headed out to sea, and each time Obada had made the same anxious pleas - that he was scared, that he didn't know how to swim, that he was not sure about the journey.Obada and Ayser were among five people who drowned, a few metres from the shore, on the coast of northern France that night - the first to die while trying to cross to the UK in a small boat in 2024, a fortnight into the new year.To try to understand how a child could be put in this situation, the BBC reconstructed Obada's journey from Syria - using videos, messages and interviews with the brothers' relatives and others who accompanied them. Our aim was to explore the wrenching decisions involved at every stage.We uncovered the extraordinary pressure that some children appear to be put under - by parents, relatives and smugglers alike. And we found a broader story about the motives and strategies of those seeking to reach the UK, and the impact of the deterrents which the British and other governments have introduced. Over the past months, the men now surrounding Obada on the slipway - nearly a dozen of them from the same neighbourhood in Daraa, a city in southern Syria - had been trying to toughen the boy up, telling him to be strong, to look after himself, to be a man. But it wasn't helping. It was normal for men to attempt the trip, given that women would be considered more vulnerable, not least since they would transit through war-torn Libya. But there were also two mothers with teenage children attempting the crossing that night.By now the inflatable boat was already in the water at the end of the slipway, and some people were clambering on board. In all there were more than 60 people in the crowd around them hoping for a place - far too many to fit safely. The smugglers had handed out motorcycle inner tubes as flotation devices with instructions not to inflate them until the boat was on its way to England.The ebbing tide quickly began tugging at the boat, pulling it away from the slipway and out towards deeper water. It was early on Sunday 14 January and the wind had dropped enough for the smuggling gangs to attempt to launch their first crossings of 2024.Soon there was a frantic scramble as people rushed into the sea trying to get on the boat as it drifted from the shoreline. And in the growing chaos came a deepening sense of confusion. This wasn't the typical wide beach that they had all seen along the northern French coast. Instead, the smugglers had brought them to the centre of Wimereux, a small resort town just north of the port of Boulogne, and to a slipway in the middle of a substantial sea wall, at high tide.There was no shallow surf to wade through as they sought to board the retreating boat, but instead a steep drop from the sides of the slipway into deep water. "It's not what we expected," said one of the survivors.In his bedsit in west London, another of Obada's brothers, Nada, 25, kept glancing at his phone. It was 01:00 in London, 02:00 in France. A few hours earlier, Nada had called the whole group as they sat warming themselves around a fire at their makeshift camp under a canal bridge in Calais. They'd seemed confident about the journey ahead. Even Obada, wearing a dark knitted hat and blue scarf, had grinned, and held up two fingers to the camera in a victory sign. Their long, difficult journey was so nearly over.Nada had made the same dangerous crossing two years earlier, ignoring his father, at home in Daraa, who had initially urged him to be patient, suggesting the war in Syria might soon end."But we've waited for 12 years, and it is not finished. There's no safety. There was no (other) way to ask for asylum," Nada remembers telling his father. Nada is a bearded, soft-spoken man, and tall, like all his brothers.Nada had chosen to travel to England because an uncle had already made the journey almost a decade earlier and been granted permission to remain. Both men had come illegally because, Nada said, there was no alternative.According to Asylum Aid, a charity providing specialist legal advice to people seeking asylum, there is in practice no way for Syrian nationals to apply for asylum without travelling in person to the UK. The vast majority try to cross the border illegally as there are no visas to apply for asylum. Family reunion - one of the few legal routes - is narrowly defined and visas are often refused, but some do succeed. A small number are also granted entry via resettlement schemes and Home Office statistics show that, in the year ending September 2023, about 325 Syrians were permitted to enter this way. More than 90% of Syrians who apply for asylum in the UK are successful, because of the conflict still raging in their country.Arriving in England, Nada had told officials that he had received death threats at his university in Damascus after being accused of disloyalty to the government and that he wanted to avoid being conscripted into the military."It was not safe. You go to the army and stay 10 years. You need to kill, or you die. We don't want this."In October last year, Nada was granted refugee status and permission to remain in the UK for five years. He recently found a warehouse job near Wembley. He's now taking an English language course and hopes to bring his wife from Syria soon - something he is allowed to apply for as a refugee - and eventually to resume his law degree in England.Soon after arriving in the UK, Nada had encouraged his brothers, still at home in Daraa, to join him."You're young, you can study here," he said he told Obada by phone.Several cousins had also reached the UK since the start of Syria's civil war. There was a whole network here of people from Daraa, a city with a reputation as the birthplace of the revolution against the Assad regime."You can make a new life here," Nada enthused.In Daraa, Obada had attended school. His brothers thought he was "very good and very clever", and hoped he might want to become a doctor. He was a keen football player and talked excitedly to Nada about watching Manchester City play in England."Just a child," a friend who knew him in Syria said.But there are indications that Obada was also being encouraged, or perhaps even pressured, to travel by his increasingly despairing parents. His father, Abu Ayeser, had multiple health problems and now hoped for treatment in the UK. His mother, Um Ayeser, confirmed to us in a video message that "my little son went so that he could reunite with us in the future".A neighbour from Daraa, who was with Obada the night he drowned, backed that up."He would reach Britain and reunite with his brother and soon after would bring his mother and father. That was the whole point of them leaving, so his father could seek medical treatment abroad," said the man, who asked us not to reveal his name.In fact, the plan was flawed from the start. Given that he already had an adult brother in London, Obada would not have been in a position, as a minor, to arrange for his parents to follow him legally.Obada was still 13 when he and his brother Ayser boarded a plane from Damascus to the Libyan city of Benghazi, in May last year. Visas are not required for Syrians travelling to Libya and an uncle working in Dubai had helped them with money, but joining him instead in the Gulf had not been an option. Dubai has no asylum system. Obada would have been unable to attend school there, and the family seemed determined to aim for the UK.If Obada, perhaps swept along by his parents' pleas, and his older brother's enthusiasm and determination, had not fully understood the risks involved, he soon would.In October 2023, after months of waiting in Libya, the brothers attempted to cross the Mediterranean in a smuggler's boat, setting off from the capital, Tripoli. But they were seized by a Tunisian patrol boat and taken back to Libya, where they fell into the hands of a local militia."We were imprisoned and tortured for a month," said a 23-year-old known as Faris, a neighbour from Daraa, who was with them frequently on the journey from Syria. They slept on the bare floor, and were often fed only once a day, with a small bowl of pasta. Eventually, with more financial help from their uncle in Dubai, the two brothers managed to buy their freedom for $900 (£707) each.At this point, unsurprisingly, Obada started to voice serious doubts about continuing the journey."He was scared. We used to talk to him to make him stronger and tell him not to worry about anything. But he needed someone to take care of him," remembers Faris.When the group announced they had found another smuggler willing to take them to Italy, Obada called his parents and told them this would be his last attempt at crossing the Mediterranean. If it didn't work, he'd come home."We held his hand. We told him, 'We are with you, there's no need to be scared,'" said Faris, as the group climbed on to another inflatable boat in December.And this time, they succeeded, narrowly. After 22 hours at sea, they were rescued by Italian coastguards off the island of Lampedusa. They were registered by the local authorities, which would make it difficult for them to apply for asylum in any other EU country but Italy. Nevertheless, once they were allowed to go free, they set off from Bologna on the Italian mainland, first to Milan, and then across the border into France.Nada, meanwhile, was starting to have doubts of his own. The rules for asylum seekers were getting stricter in the UK. He called his brothers again."I told [them] to go to Germany, or Italy. Because here, [there are] difficult rules. New rules are very hard for asylum seekers."But the brothers refused.In theory, the UK's new Illegal Migration Act, which came into force last July, would now deny Obada any right to claim asylum and to remain in the UK. But in reality, with no agreement yet on where to send those arriving in small boats, Obada would most likely have ended up joining tens of thousands of others in what the Refugee Council has described as "a state of permanent limbo" - living in the UK, but without any clear future.Nada's brothers continued by train to Paris. They knew no-one in mainland Europe. And Nada was in England, as were many other relatives. Besides, the hardest part of the journey was surely over."I want to come here [to the UK] because you are here," Nada remembers Obada telling him. They would stick to their original plan.And so, in early January, Obada, Ayser and half a dozen Syrian friends arrived in Calais. They pitched tents under a bridge, trying to avoid the French police who would sometimes take the tents and order them to "move on". The BBC has spoken to a local charity that sought to help the group in Calais. Obada was offered shelter, as a minor, but said he wanted to stay with his brother. The organisation, which is not being named because of the sensitivity of its work, was also in contact with at least two other teenage boys who would go on to board the same boat that Obada tried to take.A charity representative told us the smugglers in Calais prevented some of these other boys from "deciding for themselves", and that they also felt "under pressure from their families".Speaking about one of the other boys, the representative said: "He phoned us to tell us he was afraid. He told us that it was his parents who forced him (to attempt the crossing)."After more than a week, the group were told to get ready by Syrian smugglers to whom they had paid €2,000 each to take them to the UK. The forecast was good. They would leave on Saturday night.The wind had died down along the coast. But the temperature was only just above freezing, and the sea was perhaps 7C.In the dark, in Wimereux, Obada tried to join the crush of people attempting to board the inflatable as it was moving away from the slipway. But immediately, he and Ayser found they were out of their depth and thrashing around in the cold sea."They started screaming and asking for help," said Faris, who had managed to clamber back on to the slipway and was already helping to drag people out of the water. But in the dark, he couldn't make out where Obada was."I couldn't see them anymore. They disappeared into the water. The water pulled them, and I couldn't reach them. We didn't know it would be [deep] like this," he said.French police were on patrol nearby. Extra funding from the UK has enabled France to boost the number of officers in the region, but there still aren't enough to monitor every section of the roughly 150km (93 miles) of coastline now used by the smugglers.A navy helicopter and a patrol boat arrived at the scene at 02:15. Rescue workers helped treat 20 migrants who were suffering from hypothermia. But Obada was not among them."I can still hear it in my head, the screaming, the screaming to death, you could say," recalled Sgt Maj Maxime Menu, who had plunged into the freezing water in another rescue mission in the same area that night.A few minutes later, Nada received a phone call in London."Both of them are gone."It was another of the Syrians in the group calling. He had managed to get Ayser out of the water first, but too late. And then Obada's body was pulled ashore. Unable to swim, they had both drowned perhaps 10m (11yds) from the slipway.In his bedsit, Nada crumpled into tears at the memory of answering the call. He began to sob, his chest heaving, then he wiped his eyes.If you knew then what you know now, would you have stayed in Syria? I asked him."Yes. After what happened to Ayser and Obada, I would have stayed in Syria," he replied.Do you wish Obada had stayed in Syria too?"Yes."Do you feel guilty about encouraging him to make the trip."Yes. Yes," he said.The following evening, about 100 locals from Calais and a handful of migrants gathered in the town centre to hold a minute's silence for the five dead and to add Obada's and Ayser's names to a long scroll listing those who have died trying to cross the Channel in recent years."The biggest fault is the laws of Europe who make the life of the refugees impossible. Who give them not any rights. Who make their life here in Calais and all over the borders impossible. And we have to remember that. It is the fault of the European laws," a local French woman told the sombre crowd.Back in Daraa, Obada's parents sent us a video of their son's empty room."We want to see my children for the very last time. This is my one request. The little one was 14 years old. I wish to see him before he is buried," said his mother, Um Ayeser, between sobs."I am an ill man. I need oxygen to breathe," said his father, Abu Ayeser.How should Obada's story be judged? Many people will be inclined to criticise his parents and family for risking the life of a child on such a dangerous journey. Others, not least those with direct experience of life in war zones like Syria, may argue that it is a measure of the family's desperation that they took such a step.It seems likely that Obada's body, along with his brother's, will be buried in Calais in the coming days. The French authorities said it would not be possible to transport them to the UK, and the costs involved in a shipment back to Syria were, according to Nada, too high to contemplate.Additional research by Kathy Long, Feras Kawaf and Marianne Baisnee; design by Lilly Huynh, Matt Thomas and Kate Gaynor; production by James Percy and Dominic Bailey	
29/01/2024 04:32:00	US drone attack: Three US troops killed in drone strike on US base in Middle East - BBC News	Three US troops have been killed and dozens injured in a drone attack on a US base near Jordan's border with Syria.US President Joe Biden said the attack was carried out by "radical Iran-backed militant groups". He added: "We shall respond."Iran has denied any involvement in the attack.It is the first time that a strike has killed US troops in the region since Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.Jordan says the attack took place in Syria, not inside Jordan.There have been other attacks on US bases in the region, but before Sunday there were no fatalities, according to the US military.It is not clear who is behind this latest attack.President Biden said the US "will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing".Iran denied US and British accusations that it supported militant groups blamed for the strike."These claims are made with specific political goals to reverse the realities of the region," foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said, according to Tehran's official IRNA news agency. The White House said Mr Biden was briefed Sunday morning on the attack by US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and other officials. "Jill and I join the families and friends of our fallen - and Americans across the country - in grieving the loss of these warriors in this despicable and wholly unjust attack," Mr Biden said in a statement.The names of the servicemen killed and injured have not yet been released as officials work to notify their families.On a visit to South Carolina, Mr Biden said "we had a tough day last night in the Middle East. We lost three brave souls".US officials say at least 34 military personnel were being evaluated for possible traumatic brain injury, and that some of the injured soldiers were medically evacuated from the base for further treatment.They also say that the drone struck the living quarters, which, if confirmed, could explain the high number of casualties.US Central Command and President Biden said the attack was on a base in northeastern Jordan, near the Syrian border. It was later named by US officials as Tower 22.A Jordanian government spokesman, Muhannad Moubaideen, however, told state TV that the attack targeted al-Tanf base in Syria.In December, US officials said that US bases in Iraq and Syria had been attacked at least 97 times since 17 October. Last month, the US carried out airstrikes against Iran-affiliated groups after three US servicemembers were injured, one critically, in a drone attack on a base in northern Iraq.Earlier in January, one retaliatory US strike in Baghdad killed a militia leader accused of being behind attacks on US personnel. In a pre-recorded interview with ABC News that aired on Sunday morning, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen CQ Brown said that America's aim in the region is to "not have the conflict broaden"."The goal is to deter them and we don't want to go down a path of greater escalation that drives to a much broader conflict within the region."US and coalition troops are also stationed in the Red Sea after the Iran-backed Houthis began attacking commercial ships in the region. The Yemen-based group says it is targeting vessels in the region in support of Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel is fighting Hamas.The US military has previously said "these unlawful actions have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza"."The Houthis have fired indiscriminately into the Red Sea, targeting vessels impacting over 40 countries around the world," Centcom has said.Two Navy Seals are presumed dead after they went missing in January during an operation off the coast of Somalia to seize Iranian-made weapons bound for Houthis in Yemen. 	
28/01/2024 14:45:00	UNRWA: Key UN Gaza aid agency runs into diplomatic storm - BBC News	In Gaza, a strip of land fast becoming a wasteland, few international aid bodies can still operate. The United Nations is one of them.Its Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or UNRWA, was founded in 1949, working in Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, caring for the 700,000 Palestinians who were forced or fled from their homes with the creation of the state of Israel. Now, says the agency's head, the lifesaving assistance on which two million Gazans rely could be about to end, as several Western governments suspend their funding over allegations that some UNRWA staff were involved in the 7 October attacks on Israel.The mission currently runs shelters for the displaced and distributes the only aid that Israel is allowing in - but it is much more than that. UNRWA provides key infrastructure and tools of daily life that Gaza has sorely lacked through its seemingly endless cycles of violence, siege and impoverishment.It runs medical and educational facilities, including teacher training centres and almost 300 primary schools - as well as producing the textbooks that educate young Palestinians. In Gaza alone, it employs some 13,000 people. As the biggest UN agency operating in Gaza, it has been key to humanitarian efforts. And it has also become something of a political football, kicked by various sides over the years. Its very existence is criticised by Israel as entrenching the status of Palestinians as refugees, encouraging their continued hopes of a right of return to land from which they were driven in 1948 or during successive wars. The fate of refugees has been a core issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Many Palestinians harbour a dream of returning to historic Palestine, parts of which are now in Israel. Israel rejects that claim and has often criticised the set-up of UNRWA for the way it allows refugee status to be inherited.Moreover, Israeli governments have long denounced the agency's teaching and textbooks for, in their view, perpetuating anti-Israel views. In 2022, the Israeli watchdog IMPACT-se said UNRWA educational material taught students that Israel was attempting to "erase Palestinian identity, steal and falsify Palestinian heritage, and erase the cultural heritage of Jerusalem", adding that the agency promoted "anti-Semitism, hate, intolerance and lack of neutrality". The European Commission identified what it called "anti-Semitic material" in the schoolbooks, "including even incitement to violence". The European Parliament has called repeatedly for EU funding to the Palestinian Authority to be conditional on removing such content. UNRWA has previously said that reports made about its educational material were "inaccurate and misleading" and that many of the books in question were not used in its schools.In 2018, the administration of Donald Trump, a staunch supporter of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ceased financial support altogether for UNRWA, calling the body "irredeemably flawed". Now, as several Western governments freeze their funding, the agency is again in potentially serious trouble - with significant implications for the 5.3 million Palestinian refugees registered with it. The US, one of the countries taking the decision, is its biggest donor, contributing some $340m (£268m) in 2022. Germany, which has also suspended financing, comes next, having sent $162m that year.Israel has long accused branches of the UN of bias, antisemitism and worse. And now, a government facing increasing criticism at home and abroad over the war in Gaza has seized on this opportunity to bolster its argument - and somewhat shift the focus.For Israel's Western allies, this is also a chance to show understanding and support for Israel while at the same time keeping up the pressure on its government to rein in the offensive. Despite pausing funds, White House National Security Adviser John Kirby was at pains to point out that the violations of a handful of staff "should not impugn the entire agency", which, he added had "helped save literally thousands of lives in Gaza. They do important work".Israel's foreign minister has labelled UNRWA "the civilian arm of Hamas" and said it should not have a role in post-conflict Gaza, which begs the question: if the United Nations won't be allowed to pick up the pieces of a shattered territory, what will?	
28/01/2024 14:31:00	Red Sea: UK navy ship HMS Diamond shoots down Houthi drone - BBC News	A British war ship has shot down a Houthi drone targeting the vessel in the Red Sea.The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in a statement that HMS Diamond had deployed the missile on Saturday, and no injuries or damage were sustained.The Iran-backed Houthis have been targeting ships they say are linked to Israel and the West that travel through the Red Sea trade route.Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said the UK remains "undaunted" by the attacks.Posting on X, he called the latest attack by the Yemen-based group "illegal", adding: "Our commitment to protect innocent lives and the freedom of navigation is absolutely unwavering."The MoD said in its statement: "These intolerable and illegal acts are completely unacceptable and it is our duty to protect the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea."A spokesperson for the MoD confirmed that this is the third incident of this kind with HMS Diamond since December - the first taking place on 16 December and the second on 9 January.Earlier this week, the US and UK launched joint air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. It was the eighth time the US had struck Houthi targets, and the second time the UK was involved. On Friday, the Marlin Luanda - a British-linked oil tanker in the Gulf of Aden - was set on fire for several hours after being hit by a missile fired by the Houthis.The fire was extinguished with no crew injured after French, Indian and US naval ships provided assistance to the vessel.The Houthis said it targeted the vessel in response to "American-British aggression against our country".The Houthis have targeted foreign ships in the area since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. They have declared support for Hamas and have said they were targeting ships travelling to Israel.	
27/01/2024 22:39:00	Houthis attack British-linked tanker Marlin Luanda in Gulf of Aden - BBC News	A tanker with links to the UK was on fire for several hours in the Gulf of Aden after being hit by a missile fired by the Houthis. The Iran-backed movement, based in Yemen, said it targeted the Marlin Luanda on Friday in response to "American-British aggression".The US and UK have launched air strikes on Houthi targets in response to attacks on ships in the Red Sea region.French, Indian and US naval ships provided assistance to the vessel.UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps called the attack "intolerable and illegal.""It is our duty to protect freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and we remain as committed to that cause as ever," he said on X.The operator of the Marlin Luanda is registered as being Oceonix Services Ltd, a UK registered company. The tanker flies under the flag of the Marshall Islands and is operated on behalf of Trafigura - a multinational trading company. In an update on Saturday, Trafigura said all crew were safe and that the fire in a cargo tank had been put out. The ship was now sailing towards a safe harbour, the company said. The US Central Command (Centcom) said there were no casualties on the tanker, which was made up of 22 Indian and 1 Bangladeshi crew members. It is the latest attack on commercial shipping by the Houthis in and around the Red Sea. The group says it is targeting vessels in the region in support of Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel is fighting Hamas.In a statement, a Houthi spokesperson claimed the Marlin Luanda was a British ship and was targeted in response to "American-British aggression against our country". The UK government said attacks on commercial shipping are "completely unacceptable" and that Britain and its allies "reserve the right to respond appropriately".The US Central Command said "these unlawful actions have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza". "Neither the vessel nor its crew have any affiliation to Israel. The Houthis have fired indiscriminately into the Red Sea, targeting vessels impacting over 40 countries around the world," Centcom said in a statement. The UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said the incident happened 60 nautical miles south-east of Aden.It warned other vessels to transit with caution and report any suspicious activity.Later, Centcom said its forces had conducted a strike at 03:45 local time (00:45 GMT) on Saturday "against a Houthi anti-ship missile aimed into the Red Sea and which was prepared to launch". They "destroyed the missile in self-defence", Centcom said.Since November, the Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels travelling through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.	
27/01/2024 12:04:00	Uri Geller unearths Scottish brick below Israeli museum - BBC News	Spoon-bending illusionist Uri Geller has found a brick, made near a Scottish island he owns, beneath his own museum in Israel. Archaeologists pulled it from the furnace of the old soap factory in Old Jaffa, Tel Aviv during excavation work. The brick was emblazoned with the word "Forth" - the trademark of a defunct brickworks in Stirlingshire. Geller, 77, who owns Lamb Island in the Firth of Forth, said he was "completely freaking out" at the discovery. He now plans to display the brick in a gold-plated case in the museum. "When the archaeologist crawled out of the hole with a brick that said Forth on it I said 'This cannot be true, I have an island in the Forth," he told BBC Scotland News."What are the odds of finding a brick here in Israel that was made near my island in the Firth of Forth. This is synchronicity."Geller moved back to his homeland eight years ago after spending 35 years in England with his wife Hanna and two children.It took four years to renovate the historic building and turn it into Uri Geller Museum.He leads tours of the building, which contains hundreds of pieces of memorabilia from his career, including items from famous friends including Michael Jackson, Salvador Dali and John Lennon.The self-proclaimed psychic said the archaeologists were called in after he "got a feeling" there was more to discover under the £6m museum's cobbled floor. They discovered a furnace and round pot where olive oil was boiled during soap making in the former factory - and the Scottish brick. Mark Cranston, founder of Scottishbrickhistory.co.uk, said the brick came from the now defunct Roughcastle Firebrick Works in Bonnybridge in Stirlingshire."This brick says Forth, which was Roughcastle's trademark. They were running between 1892 and 1964 so it could have been made any time between those dates," he said. "Israel is a popular place for them to turn up. They would be taken there by ship."This is an exciting find. These bricks would be used as a firebrick. Metal buckles under heat so firebricks are used as a bridge between the heat."Geller bought Lamb Island, off the east coast of Scotland, in 2009. He described it as "a very special place - possibly the most mystical island in the world".He said: "It is unbelievable that this brick could have come from anywhere in Europe but it comes from Forth in Scotland where my island is. It is mind blowing."It is also incredible that it came from under very old stones here in Israel."  Do you have an idea for a story we could cover? Contact our local reporters in Edinburgh here.	
27/01/2024 11:29:00	Huge push for Gaza aid - but little hope for those suffering - BBC News	The Qatar Emiri Air Force cargo plane, a hulking grey C17, sat by a runway at the sprawling Al Udeid airbase. Deep inside, Britain's Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron, in black loafers and sweater, attempted to push a pallet of humanitarian aid for Gaza into the aircraft. It wouldn't budge. He stepped back while burly Qatari airmen in combat fatigues made some adjustments. But the former British prime minister wasn't giving up, and with a sudden shift, the bundle - part of nearly 30 tonnes of aid including tents and food - began to move into the belly of the plane.Lord Cameron's latest Middle East tour was aimed at helping to broker a permanent ceasefire to the conflict, the release of the more than 132 remaining hostages, and an increase in the aid getting into Gaza on a daily basis. He's putting in a lot of effort, but so far at least, has little to show for it. Standing by the plane's enormous wings, Lord Cameron told me: "Nobody wants this conflict to go on a moment longer than necessary. But I've always understood that you won't have a proper ceasefire if you've still got Hamas in place, able to launch attacks on Israel. "Everyone has to understand, that must be dismantled, otherwise no peace, no ceasefire will be sustainable."His latest round of in-person diplomacy (the day before he met Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas) came in advance of this weekend's talks under way in France, to free the hostages and pause hostilities. But there still appears little prospect the suffering will end soon in Gaza. There's a chasm between the aid Gaza needs, and will need for years to come, and what it is currently receiving. While Israel's bombardment of Gaza continues, the flow of aid is being drip-fed into the strip. Britain says 500 trucks a day are needed to provide basic needs - most days fewer than 200 make it inside. On one day this month, only 30 crossed into Gaza. "It's vital we can actually get it into Gaza and crucially, once it's in Gaza, get it around Gaza," Lord Cameron said. "What I was saying yesterday to the Israelis, they've got to deal with the bottlenecks. They've got to make sure the crossing points are opened more often. They've got to make sure the checking is done more quickly. They've got, crucially, to give the visas to the UN staff and the trucks that the UN staff need to get the aid around Gaza."Nine out of 10 people are living on one meal a day in Gaza, according to the World Food Programme. All aid is subject to stringent inspections by Israel which does not want anything to get inside that could benefit Hamas. Qatar and Britain are allies, the Gulf emirate and Israel are not. It hosts the Hamas political leadership, and has been a key mediator in talks to release the hostages still held by the group, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by several countries.Qatar helped secure the previous week-long ceasefire in November that led to the freeing of 105 hostages taken in the attack of 7 October, which killed 1,300 people. But as David Cameron arrived in Doha, a recording of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was leaked in which he described Qatar's role as a mediator in the Gaza war as "problematic". The British foreign secretary dismissed the criticism and said that Qatar's role was "helpful".Qatar said it was appalled at the Israeli prime minister's remarks, which came just before this weekend's meeting in France, which will bring together William Burns, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, his Israeli counterpart, David Barnea and Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani. The Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel will also attend. The talks are aimed at freeing the Israeli captives and establishing a ceasefire, however wide the gap between Israel and Hamas's demands.  Hosting Lord Cameron at the airbase was Lolwah Rashid Al-Khater, Qatar's Minister of State for International Cooperation. Some 12 tonnes of aid on the plane are from Qatar, and even this joint consignment is far from enough said the minister. "On some days, these past days, even less than 100 [trucks make it into Gaza]. This situation is very difficult. There are many bottlenecks. And as a matter of fact, man-created obstacles, I should say. According to the 4th Geneva Convention article 59, it is the obligation on the occupying power, in this case it would be Israeli occupation, to ensure adequate levels of aid, supplies, and aid schemes," she told me. And in some cases, the wrong type of aid is being sent, the Qatari diplomat said. One recent consignment from a foreign donor was full of covid tests, she said. As the cargo plane filled with tents climbed slowly into the clear blue desert sky, Lolwah Al-Khater had one final point to make: "It's very important to emphasise," she said, "that aid can never and should never be substituting the need for an immediate and a permanent ceasefire. "Unfortunately, some actors have been trying to promote that we need more aid without doing enough on the other front."The situation inside Gaza is dire - at least 1.7m people have been displaced, some multiple times. The 285 family tents from Qatar and Britain will go to Unicef in Gaza and house up to five people in each tent. In recent days torrential rain there has made conditions even worse. The healthcare system is on its knees. From inside Gaza, a British doctor messaged me: "People don't get operated upon because a) no beds b) no resources," he wrote. "Lots of people are just left to die if the trauma burden is too high, on the floor in the emergency department, most of the time. We received 45 last night from Khan Younis, of which 70% died because of lack of resources. I think from a humanitarian perspective, it is just shocking to see the rapidity of the unfolding situation in front of my eyes." 	
26/01/2024 19:09:00	Israel reined in by ICJ rulings on Gaza - but will it obey? - BBC News	This was not a complete victory for South Africa, or the Palestinians.The ICJ did not order Israel to halt its military campaign - an implied recognition of Israel's right to self defence in the wake of the Hamas attacks on 7 October last year.But the UN's highest legal body has recognised that the situation in Gaza is catastrophic.Crucially, it said that situation was "at serious risk of deteriorating further" before the court delivers its final verdict on the charge of genocide, a process that could take years.As a result, it made several demands of Israel, broadly in line with most of the nine "provisional measures" demanded by South Africa.By large majorities the court's 17 judges ruled that Israel should do everything in its power to avoid killing Palestinians, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, creating intolerable living conditions in Gaza, or deliberately preventing Palestinian births.It also said Israel should do more to "prevent and punish" public incitement to genocide, citing examples by Israel's president and defence minister.And there was a call for "immediate and effective measures" to address the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.Not a call for a ceasefire, then, but a series of demands that, if implemented, would drastically change the nature of Israel's military campaign in Gaza.Israel vehemently rejects the allegation of genocide, arguing that it is Hamas that's responsible for putting Palestinian civilians in harm's way.It says Hamas operates inside and underneath Gaza's densely populated towns and refugee camps, making it virtually impossible for Israel to avoid killing civilians.And it says that it has gone to great lengths to warn civilians to avoid danger. The belief that Israel has "the most moral army in the world" is one almost universally held by the country's Jewish citizens.But since early October, Israel's actions have resulted in the displacement of around 85% of Gaza's 2.3 million population. Those who flee the fighting seeking refuge in squalid, overcrowded shelters, with dwindling healthcare and grossly inadequate humanitarian supplies.It was clear, soon after the court's American president Joan Donoghue began speaking, that the urgency of Gaza's plight was uppermost in the court's mind and that Israel had not succeeded in its bid to have the entire case thrown out.Judge Donoghue delivered a bleak summary of the suffering being experienced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. She said the plight of children was "especially heartbreaking".This is not the court's final ruling on genocide - that's likely to take several years.But the measures called for today are designed to offer the Palestinians of Gaza some measure of protection, while the judges consider South Africa's fundamental charge against Israel.Israel must now decide how to respond. The ICJ's rulings are binding, but there's no enforcement mechanism. Israel could choose to ignore the judges altogether.With diplomatic efforts now apparently concentrating on the possibility of a two-month ceasefire, and efforts still being made to improve the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip, Israel may argue that it's already taking steps to meet the court's demands.But even if the situation eases - and there's no sign yet - the fact remains that Israel still stands accused of genocide, a case the ICJ believes is plausible and thus worthy of further detailed consideration.Israel, a country born out of the ashes of the world's worst example of genocide, must now live under this legal shadow until the court delivers its verdict.	
26/01/2024 16:54:00	ICJ says Israel must prevent genocide in Gaza - BBC News	The UN's top court has ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, but stopped short of telling it to halt the war.The highly anticipated hearing was part of a controversial case brought by South Africa.South Africa had asked the court to order Israel to stop military action straight away pending a decision on whether Israel has committed genocide.Israel has vehemently rejected the accusation as "wholly unfounded".Friday's hearing at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague was the first time the judges have issued a ruling as part of the case which began two weeks ago. A verdict on the central allegation of genocide is expected to take much longer, possibly years.Although the court did not call for a halt to Israel's military action, as South Africa had asked it to do, it is being interpreted as a victory for those who support South Africa's case. The ICJ found it did have jurisdiction on the matter, and decided there was a plausible case under the 1948 Genocide Convention, and that the Palestinian population in Gaza was at real risk of irreparable damage."For the implementation of the international rule of law, the [ICJ's] decision is a momentous one," said South Africa in a statement. It called Friday's ruling a "significant milestone in the search for justice for the Palestinian people".The Palestinian foreign minister said the ruling showed that "no state is above the law", adding it "should serve as a wake-up call for Israel and actors who enabled its entrenched impunity".Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not address the ruling directly but said "Israel's commitment to international law is unwavering. Equally unwavering is our sacred commitment to defend our country." He said South Africa's allegation that Israel was committing genocide was "not only false, it's outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it".Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant dismissed the ruling, saying Israel "does not need to be lectured on morality in order to distinguish between terrorists and the civilian population in Gaza".A spokesman for Hamas, the Palestinian group whose unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October triggered the war, called the outcome "important", saying it contributed to "isolating Israel", Reuters news agency reported. The ICJ ordered Israel to take a series of measures against potentially genocidal acts against Palestinians in Gaza. These include measures not only on the battlefield but also against public incitement to genocide. It also ordered Israel to take "immediate and effective measures" to enable the provision of aid to people in Gaza.The court said Israel must report on its compliance to the court within one month.Although orders issued by the ICJ are legally binding, it does not have the power to enforce them. Israel is not expected to commit itself to the orders.More than 26,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza by Israel's bombardment since 7 October, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. Israel launched its offensive after waves of Hamas gunmen burst through the border early that day, killing about 1,300 people - mainly civilians - and taking about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages.	
26/01/2024 14:35:00	Kerem Shalom crossing: Israeli protesters hold up aid trucks to Gaza - BBC News	Hundreds of Israeli protesters have blocked some humanitarian aid trucks from entering Gaza for a third day.Demonstrators, including families of hostages still held in Gaza, waved Israeli flags at a key crossing and chanted against "aiding the enemy". The protesters say they are demanding no aid for Gaza until all of the hostages are released. This comes despite a US demand that aid to civilians in Gaza be allowed to enter "without interruption".For a third consecutive day, the protesters descended on the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza to try to block humanitarian aid from entering the enclave. A queue of trucks carrying aid supplies, some of them flying Egyptian flags, idled for hours at the crossing as the protesters urged the government to stop aid supplies until the remaining captives held by Hamas are freed.The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said that on Wednesday - the first day of the protests - only nine trucks were able to cross at Kerem Shalom, while 114 were diverted to the Rafah crossing in Egypt. The UN said that only 153 trucks had entered Gaza on Wednesday, which was well below what had been able to enter in recent weeks.The Israeli government is facing growing international pressure to allow more humanitarian relief into Gaza, combined with intense domestic pressure to secure the release of the hostages.The protesters say they view the delivery of aid to Gaza while their loved ones are still being held by Hamas as "a moral failure". They say they fear the aid could end up in the group's hands. Israeli media report that although some of the protesters are related to hostages, others are the parents of IDF soldiers currently deployed in Gaza, with another group representing right-wing activists who promote a return of Jewish settlements to Gaza. The demonstration took place amid unconfirmed reports that Israeli and American officials will hold "critical" hostage talks with Qatari and Egyptian mediators in Europe in the coming days.The reports suggest that the director of the US Central Intelligence Agency, William Burns, and the Mossad chief, David Barnea, will meet Qatar's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, to discuss the release of more than 100 Israeli hostages and a pause in fighting in Gaza.The White House has described the talks as "sober" and "serious" efforts, involving players who were key to sealing a previous agreement in November. But Hamas continues to insist on a full ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.A senior Palestinian official has told the BBC that mediators have proposed the phased release of Israeli hostages in exchange for a renewable ceasefire, the release of Palestinian prisoners and an increase in aid.Meanwhile, heavy fighting has continued in Gaza. Israeli military officials say warplanes have carried out dozens of raids on several Hamas targets around Khan Younis during the night. The Hamas-run health ministry says Israeli attacks in the past 24 hours have killed 183 people and injured nearly 400 others. Israel launched its military campaign with the declared aim of destroying Hamas after its gunmen killed 1,300 people - mostly civilians - and took about 250 others hostage, in the unprecedented attack on southern Israeli communities on 7 October last year. Since then, health officials say more than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza.	
26/01/2024 00:00:00	ICJ ruling: UN top court orders Israel to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza but not to end war - BBC News		
26/01/2024 00:03:00	Gaza war: ICJ to rule on call for Israel to stop military action - BBC News	The UN's top court is to decide whether to issue emergency measures ordering Israel to halt its operations in Gaza.The session of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Friday is part of a case brought by South Africa alleging that Israel is committing genocide.Both countries testified when the case opened two weeks ago. Israel has vehemently rejected the allegation.A ruling against Israel is not enforceable by the court but would be politically significant.More than 25,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed and tens of thousands injured, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, since Israel began its offensive, triggered by an unprecedented attack on Israel by the group.The Hamas attack on 7 October killed about 1,300 people, mainly civilians. The attackers also took about 250 people back to Gaza as hostages.South Africa, which strongly supports the Palestinians, asked the court to issue nine provisional measures, including a halt to military activity by Israel, while it considers the accusation of genocide. A ruling on the latter is not expected for a long time, possibly years.Israel reacted with outrage to the genocide allegation, accusing South Africa of distorting the truth. It said it had a right to defend itself and was targeting Hamas fighters, not Palestinian civilians. It asked the judges to dismiss South Africa's request which it said was based on "grossly distorted" and baseless allegations of a non-existent genocide.In reaching a ruling on Friday, the 17 judges - 15 permanent justices, plus one each from South Africa and Israel - must answer two questions:Also, the judges are not limited to South Africa's specific requests. The panel could simply instruct Israel to ensure its actions comply with international law and to ensure that it does not do anything to impede deliveries of food, water or medicines.The ICJ, though, only has the power to issue advisory opinions. And while its rulings are in theory legally binding, they are not enforceable by the court. If Friday's ruling go against Israel, it is almost certain to be ignored.It would, however, place additional political pressure on Israel to work towards a ceasefire, and will intensify pressure on Israel's strongest international allies to do what they can behind the scenes to find a resolution and guarantee humanitarian assistance gets to where it is needed.	
25/01/2024 17:52:00	Qatar 'appalled' by reported criticism from Israel's Netanyahu - BBC News	Qatar has said it is "appalled" by remarks attributed to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which he apparently called its role as a mediator in the Gaza war "problematic".Israeli TV broadcast what it said was a recording of Mr Netanyahu telling the families of hostages held by Hamas that "you don't hear me thanking Qatar". "They have leverage... because they finance [Hamas]," he reportedly adds.Qatar said the comments, if true, were "irresponsible" but "not surprising".The tiny Gulf emirate has had high-level contacts with Israel since the 1990s, but they have never officially established diplomatic relations.Qatar has long championed the Palestinian cause and hosts political leaders of Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, the US and other countries.It has also provided hundreds of millions of dollars of aid for Gaza, which has been subject to a crippling blockade by Israel and Egypt since 2006, when Hamas won legislative elections. The blockade was tightened the following year when Hamas reinforced its power in Gaza by violently ousting Palestinian Authority (PA) forces.Since 2018, Israeli governments have allowed Qatar to pay the wages of tens of thousands of civil servants in Gaza's Hamas-run government, financially support the poorest families, and fund fuel deliveries for the territory's sole power plant. Qatar insists the funding was only for civilian and humanitarian purposes. The policy sparked controversy within Israel, with critics warning it was helping Hamas to stay in power and fund its military activities.   Mr Netanyahu - who has been re-elected to office for all but one of the past 15 years - said it was a way to dissuade attacks on Israel and prevent a humanitarian disaster in Gaza.Following the cross-border attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,300 people were killed and 250 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages, he dismissed as a "big lie" accusations that he had also encouraged the payments in order to strengthen Hamas at the expense of the PA.Israel responded to the attacks by launching a large-scale military campaign in Gaza with the aim of destroying Hamas. More than 25,000 people have been killed in the fighting, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Qatar used its ties with Hamas to help broker a week-long pause in the fighting in late November, during which 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were freed in exchange for some 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.The emirate has for weeks been trying to broker a new ceasefire, with Gaza's humanitarian crisis worsening and with the Israeli government coming under mounting domestic pressure to secure the release of the remaining hostages.On Tuesday, Israel's Channel 12 TV released what it said was a recording of Mr Netanyahu telling hostages' families: "You don't hear me thanking Qatar. Have you noticed?""Why? Because for me it is essentially no different from the UN or Red Cross, and in a certain sense is even more problematic - I have no illusions about them.""But I'm ready to use any actor right now that helps me bring [the hostages] home," he added.Israel has accused the UN and Red Cross of not doing enough to support the hostages or to help get them freed.The prime minister purportedly said the reason Qatar could help was because of "leverage" over Hamas."Why do they have leverage? Because they finance them."On Wednesday night, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari wrote on X, formerly Twitter: "These remarks if validated, are irresponsible and destructive to the efforts to save innocent lives, but are not surprising." "For months, and following a successful mediation last year that led to the release of more than 100 hostages, Qatar has been engaged in regular dialogue with the negotiating parties including Israeli institutions, attempting to establish the framework for a new hostage agreement and the immediate entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza."He added that Mr Netanyahu appeared to be undermining the mediation efforts "for reasons that appear to serve his political career".In response, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X: "Qatar is a country that supports and finances terrorism. It is Hamas's patron and is largely responsible for the massacre of Israeli citizens by Hamas." "One thing is certain: Qatar will not have one iota of involvement in Gaza on the day after the war," he added.There was no immediate comment from Qatar's foreign ministry.Meanwhile US President Biden is sending the director of the CIA to try to broker a new deal on hostages held in Gaza, the BBC's US partner CBS has confirmed. William Burns will meet the Qatari PM and directors of Mossad, Israel's secret service, in France.	
25/01/2024 12:05:00	Foreign Office gives warning to Worthing man running length of Africa - BBC News	A man running the length of Africa has been advised to avoid travelling through Algeria by the UK Foreign Office over safety concerns. Russell Cook, from Worthing, West Sussex, had originally planned to complete 360 marathons in 240 days.After visa complications, the 26-year-old said the challenge could be in doubt.The government warned terrorists were "likely" to try to carry out attacks in Algeria, including kidnappings.The extreme challenge began at South Africa's most southerly point on 22 April and is due to finish at Tunisia's most northerly point.Mr Cook, nicknamed "Hardest Geezer", had originally aimed to run 9,320 miles (14,500km), crossing 16 borders, but extended the challenge due to complications with his visas, health scares, geopolitical issues and an armed robbery.He is on day 279 of the challenge. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said it had provided Mr Cook with travel advice. "It clearly sets out the risks involved travelling through these dangerous areas, to where we clearly advise against all travel," a spokesman said. "Our travel advice is just that, advice, and it is up to individuals to decide whether to follow it. Visa applications are a matter for the issuing country."Mr Cook previously said the challenge could be in doubt if he could not secure permission to cross the border into Algeria from Mauritania."I've been on the road for 278 days, ran 12,000km (7,456 miles) across 13 different countries, raised over £140,000 for charity - but it is all hanging in the balance," he said.MP Alexander Stafford, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Algeria, has written to the Algerian Ambassador to the UK asking him to help grant a visa to Mr Cook.

25/01/2024 10:07:00	UUP: Iraq veteran Col Tim Collins to run in North Down - BBC News	Retired British Army colonel Tim Collins is to run for the Ulster Unionists as their North Down candidate in the next general election.Col Collins is best known for his role in the Iraq War in 2003.The last time an MP from the party was elected to North Down was 2010.Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said Northern Ireland "needs to move on and modernise" and that he backs a controversial new Troubles legacy bill.The current MP for the North Down constituency is Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry, who first won the seat in 2019, following the retirement of independent unionist Lady Hermon.Talks were reportedly taking place among unionist parties in a bid to find an agreed single unionist candidate but the UUP leader Doug Beattie says his party "does not do pacts".No date has been scheduled yet for the Westminster election but Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said it was his "working assumption" that it would take place in the second half of this year.Northern Ireland elects 18 MPs to the House of Commons.The DUP currently has eight seats, Sinn Féin holds seven while the SDLP has two and Alliance holds one seat in North Down.The UUP last held two seats at Westminster from 2015 until 2017.In relation to the recently passed UK Troubles legacy law, he told BBC Good Morning Ulster: "I take the view that justice has been weaponised in the province and it has been taken away."Sadly the fallout from this is that some people won't see justice."Northern Ireland needs to move on, and this is part of moving Northern Ireland on. It needs to join the modern world and this is crucial to achieving that."On the new law, he said: "I think, sadly, it is something that is going to have to happen if we are ever to move on in Northern Ireland."The recently passed UK legacy law offers a conditional amnesty to those accused of killings during the Troubles.It also stops any new Troubles-era court cases and inquests being held, and has been opposed by politicians in Northern Ireland."We cannot keep clinging to the past," he said."We have got to remember we have young people. We don't need more inquiries - we need better health services, we need better education, we need to spend the money where it is required, we need to move on."Asked if this aligns with party policy, he said: "That is something I'll have to discuss because I've only just recently joined the Ulster Unionist Party."Col Collins currently lives in Canterbury but said he will buy a house in the north Down area, where he grew up and has connections, if he wins the seat.

On Wednesday afternoon, UNRWA's Gaza director, Thomas White, said a building at the facility that was housing 800 people from northern Gaza was hit.In an interview with the BBC from Rafah in the evening, he said the building was struck by "two tank rounds" and that at least nine people were killed.On Thursday morning, Mr White issued a statement saying the building was "hit by two shells and caught fire". Twelve people had now been confirmed dead and 15 of the injured were in a critical condition, he added."A number of missions to assess the situation were denied. Yesterday evening, the UN finally managed to reach the affected areas to treat trauma patients, bring medical supplies and evacuate injured patients to Rafah."He added: "The situation in Khan Younis underscores a consistent failure to uphold the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law: distinction, proportionality and precautions in carrying out attacks. This is unacceptable and abhorrent and must stop." In response to UNRWA's initial reports, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: "After an examination of our operational systems, the IDF has currently ruled out that this incident is a result of an aerial or artillery strike by the IDF." "A thorough review of the operations of the forces in the vicinity is under way," it added. "The IDF is also examining the possibility that the strike was a result of Hamas fire."Vedant Patel of the US state department repeated Washington's calls for the protection of civilians in Gaza. "We deplore today's attack on the UN's Khan Younis training centre," she said, and called it "incredibly concerning".The IDF also said on Wednesday afternoon that its troops had "launched a divisional manoeuvre on West Khan Younis" that was targeting Hamas "outposts, infrastructure, and command and control centres"."Dismantling Hamas' military framework in western Khan Yunis is the heart of the logic behind the operation."The IDF added that Hamas "exploits the civilian population, exploits shelters and hospitals" - something the group has denied.Gaza's health ministry meanwhile accused the IDF of "isolating hospitals in Khan Younis and carrying out massacres in the western area of the city".The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said the al-Amal Hospital, which it runs, and its local headquarters were under "siege" by Israeli forces, trapping patients, wounded people and an estimated 13,000 displaced people.The organisation alleged that three displaced people were killed after being targeted at the entrance to the headquarters on Wednesday morning. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) warned on Tuesday night that its staff inside the nearby Nasser Medical Complex - the largest hospital still partly functioning in Gaza - had reported bombing and heavy gunfire nearby."They are currently unable to evacuate along with the thousands of people in the hospital, including 850 patients, due to roads to and from the building being either inaccessible or too dangerous." The IDF has issued evacuation orders for western parts of Khan Younis, including those where Nasser and al-Amal are located. The UN estimates there are about 88,000 residents and 425,000 displaced people in the area.Mr White told the BBC that tens of thousands more people were now on the move, heading south to Rafah, on the border with Egypt, where as many as 1.4 million are already sheltering.  In another incident in Khan Younis on Tuesday, a cameraman for the UK's ITV News filmed a Palestinian civilian being shot dead on a main road about 1.7km (1 mile) south of the UNRWA shelter.Five men are seen walking towards the combat zone holding a white flag, before there is a burst of gunfire and one of them falls to the ground. It was not clear who opened fire. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was asked in the Parliament on Wednesday whether such pictures would prompt him to push for a ceasefire in Gaza.He replied: "No-one wants to see this conflict go on for a moment longer than is necessary and we do want to see an immediate and sustained humanitarian pause."Efforts involving several countries to try to reach a ceasefire are ongoing, with one plan said to include a month-long truce and phased release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. But both Israel and Hamas appear to have rejected proposals, and hopes of any progress have been dampened.Egypt's President, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, meanwhile accused Israel of deliberately holding up aid deliveries at the Egyptian-controlled Rafah border crossing as "a form of pressure on the Gaza Strip and its people over the conflict and the release of hostages".  However, an Israeli defence ministry agency co-ordinating the deliveries with Egypt and the UN rejected the claim, insisting that "there is no limit to the amount of aid that can enter Gaza". 	
25/01/2024 00:21:00	A jobs crisis in India is driving workers to Israel - BBC News	On a frigid morning last week, hundreds of men, wrapped up in woollens and blankets, queued up inside a sprawling university campus in India's northern state of Haryana.The men, carrying backpacks and lunch bags, were queueing up for practical exams for construction jobs - plastering workers, steel fixers, tile setters - in Israel. For those like Ranjeet Kumar - a university educated, qualified teacher who has only ever managed to find work casually as a painter, steel fixer, labourer, automobile workshop technician, and a surveyor for a non-profit - it is a chance too good to pass up.The 31-year-old has never managed to earn more than 700 rupees per day, despite having two degrees and having cleared a government "trade test" to work as a "diesel mechanic". In contrast, the jobs in Israel are paying around 137,000 rupees ($1,648; £1,296) a month, along with accommodation and medical benefits.Perhaps unsurprisingly then, Mr Kumar, who got a passport last year, is eager to secure a job as a steel fixer in Israel to support his seven-member family."There are no secure jobs here. Prices are going up. I am not financially stable even after graduating nine years ago," he said.According to reports quoting officials, Israel plans to bring in 70,000 workers from China and India and other countries to boost its construction sector, which has been struggling since the 7 October Hamas attack. A labour shortage had arisen after Israel barred some 80,000 Palestinian workers following the attack, reports add.Some 10,000 workers from India will reportedly be hired. Uttar Pradesh and Haryana are accepting job applications, with the Maharshi Dayanand University in Haryana's Rohtak city hosting tests for a few thousand applicants from across the country.  (The Israeli embassy in Delhi declined to comment on the subject.)Like Mr Kumar, the job seekers in the queue are part of India's sprawling and precarious informal economy, working without formal contracts and benefits. Like Mr Kumar, many hold college degrees but are struggling to land secure jobs, and find themselves in casual construction jobs, earning up to 700 rupees a day for about 15-20 days a month. They carried their resumes - "I  am a good team player with my team," said one.Many juggle multiple jobs to augment earnings. Some attribute their financial setbacks and limited prospects to India's 2016 currency ban - or demonetisation - and the strict 2020 Covid lockdown. Others complain about question paper leaks in government exams. Many claim to have tried to pay agents to illegally enter the US and Canada but found it difficult to gather the money. All this, they said, had prompted them to look for a secure, more lucrative overseas job, "never mind the risk of working in a war zone". Sanjay Verma, who also graduated in 2014, obtained a technical education diploma, and spent six years attempting over a dozen government exams for positions in the police, paramilitary and railways. ("There are very few jobs, and the demand is 20 times their number," he said). In 2017, he failed to pay up 140,000 rupees to an agent for a promised 900 euro-per-month farm job in Italy. Parbat Singh Chauhan said he had slipped back into uncertainty after the twin shocks of the currency ban and the pandemic lockdown. The 35-year-old from Rajasthan worked as a emergency ambulance driver, earning 8,000 rupees a month for a 12-hour daily job. He also undertook small construction contracts in his village, and even bought six cars for taxi rentals.Mr Chauhan, like many others, commenced his journey after completing high school. He began as a newspaper hawker in school, earning 300 rupees a month. After his mother died, he worked in a clothes shop. When he didn't find a decent job, he did a course in repairing mobile phones. "But that didn't help much," he said.For five to seven years until 2016, his fortunes improved: he drove an ambulance, managed small village construction contracts and ran his fleet of taxis. "But the lockdown [in 2020] destroyed me. I had to sell my cars as I couldn't afford the mortgage. Now I am back to driving an ambulance and taking small government construction contracts," he said.There are others like Ram Avatar, a 40-year-old tile setter from Haryana with two decades of experience. Faced with the challenges of a rising cost of living and stagnant wages, he worries about funding the higher education of his children - his daughter is pursuing a bachelor's in science, while his son aspires to become a chartered accountant. He tried for jobs in Dubai, Italy, and Canada but couldn't afford the exorbitant fees demanded by agents. With expenses for rent, his children's coaching, and food, he says he's struggling."We know there's a war going on in Israel. I am not afraid of death. We can die here too," he said.Then there's the rising tide of aspiration. Harsh Jat, 28, earned a humanities degree in 2018. Initially a mechanic in a car factory, he later spent two years as a police vehicle driver, growing weary of dealing with "intoxicated people misusing the emergency line". Subsequently, he worked as a pub bouncer in the upscale suburb of Gurgaon, earning 40,000 rupees. "These jobs, they throw you out after two years and there's no security," he told me.Mr Jat, jobless, returned to his family's eight-acre farm. "But nobody wants to farm now," he said. He tried government jobs - clerk, policeman - without success. He said young men in his village have paid agents 6m rupees each to illegally enter US and Canada. They were sending remittances home, funding their families' acquisition of fancy cars."I want to go abroad and get a good, well-paying job because when I have a child he will ask me, 'why does my neighbour have a swanky SUV, and we don't'?" said Mr Jat. "I am not scared of the war."The jobs scene in India presents a mixed picture. Government data from its Periodic Labour Force Survey, shows a declining trend in joblessness - from 6% in 2017-2018 to 4% in 2021-2022. Santosh Mehrotra, a development economist and visiting professor at the University of Bath, attributes this to the inclusion of unpaid work as jobs in government data."It's not that jobs are not happening. It's just that organised jobs are barely growing and at the same time, the number of young people looking for jobs is increasing," said Prof Mehrotra.Unemployment is falling but remains high, according to the latest State of Working India report, by Azim Premji University. After stagnating since the 1980s, the share of workers with regular wages or salaried work had begun increasing in 2004 - 18 to 25% for men and 10 to 25% for women, according to the report. Since 2019, however, the pace of regular wage jobs had decreased due to a "growth slowdown and the pandemic".The report found that above 15% of graduates - and a massive 42% for graduates under 25 years old - had no jobs in the country after the pandemic. "This group has aspirations for higher incomes, and they don't want to do insecure gig work. This group is trading that extreme risk [of going to Israel] for higher incomes and some level of reduced precarity," said Rosa Abraham, a labour economist with Azim Premji University. One of them is Ankit Upadhyay from Uttar Pradesh. He said he paid an agent, got a visa and spent eight years in Kuwait working as a steel fixer before losing his job during the pandemic."I have no fear left. I want to work in Israel. I don't mind the risks there. There's no job security at home," he said.	
24/01/2024 18:57:00	Saudi Arabia to get first alcohol shop in more than 70 years - BBC News	Saudi Arabia has said it will open a shop in Riyadh selling alcohol to a select band of non-Muslim expats, the first to open in more than 70 years.The clientele will be limited to diplomatic staff, who have for years imported booze in sealed official packages known as diplomatic pouches.Saudi officials said the shop would counter "the illicit trade of alcohol".Prohibition has been law since 1952, after one of King Abdulaziz's sons drunkenly shot dead a British diplomat.The new store will be located in Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter west of the city centre, according to a document seen by the AFP and Reuters news agencies.A source familiar with the plans told Reuters the shop was expected to open within weeks. There will be limitations, however:However - according to the document seen by AFP - these will not be particularly stringent. Patrons will be limited to 240 "points" of alcohol per month. One litre of spirits will be worth six points, one litre of wine three points and one litre of beer one point.There are also no suggestions that the clientele will be widened to "ordinary" foreigners in the kingdom without diplomatic privileges, who officially have no access to alcohol.While alcohol will become part of Riyadh life, drinkers would be wise to be mindful of where they drink and how they behave afterwards.Under current Saudi law, penalties for consumption or possession of alcohol can include fines, jail time, public flogging and deportation for unauthorised foreigners.The document also said authorities are planning a "new regulatory framework" that would also allow "specific quantities" of alcohol to be brought in by diplomats to "put an end to... an uncontrolled exchange of such goods", it added.For years diplomatic staff have had to use their "pouches", which cannot be tampered with by authorities in their host country, to bring in limited amounts of alcohol. The moves are the latest in a series of initiatives known as "Vision 2030" to liberalise Saudi society under the crown prince and de facto ruler of the country, Mohammed bin Salman.Other Gulf states operate similar alcohol regimes. However, the UAE and Qatar also allow the sale of alcohol to non-Muslims over 21 in hotels, clubs and bars. There is no suggestion from the Saudi document that the government there is considering doing the same. While alcohol is forbidden under Islam, Saudi Arabia had until 1952 held a conciliatory attitude to its presence inside the kingdom. That changed after Mishari bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, a prince, shot dead Cyril Ousman, the British vice-consul in Jeddah, in 1951 for refusing to pour him another drink at a function.A year later, King Abdulaziz imposed a total ban on alcohol. Mishari was convicted of murder.	
24/01/2024 16:35:00	Mediators push for Gaza ceasefire deal but gaps remain between Israel and Hamas - BBC News	There is huge pressure for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza and the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas.Up to now, weeks of mediation by Qatar and Egypt with US involvement have brought no breakthrough.But in recent days, more reports have suggested "serious" progress is being made in indirect talks held with delegations from Israel and Hamas. At the same time, on Wednesday, unnamed Israeli officials quoted by the Israeli media are cautioning that there is a "very large" gap on fundamental issues.From what the BBC has learnt, the main block appears to boil down to major differences over how to bring a complete end to the war.A senior Palestinian official, who is familiar with ongoing talks, told us that Cairo had laid out a new five-stage framework to Hamas officials.This is said to start with a humanitarian truce, during which Hamas would release the remaining civilians it is holding hostage, including women, children and the elderly. In exchange, some Palestinians would be freed from Israeli jails and the amount of desperately needed aid going into Gaza would increase.Finally, there would be a long-term ceasefire and complete cessation of hostilities.  The handover of the remaining Israeli hostages would be accompanied by further Palestinian inmates being allowed out of prison, according to our source.The indication is that the release of more high-profile Palestinian prisoners would be sought in exchange for the captive Israeli soldiers.The Palestinian official said that Israel was insisting on keeping its forces on the ground until the last stage of the process. We were told that Hamas has demanded that the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops and return of displaced residents to their homes takes place earlier.Other international media reports have said that while Hamas is demanding a full ceasefire, Israeli negotiators are only prepared to accept a pause that would last weeks, but could be extended as conditions evolved.At a news conference on Tuesday, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson, Majed al-Ansari said: "We have presented ideas to both sides, we are getting a constant stream of replies, and that in its own right is a cause for optimism."Later, White House spokesperson John Kirby said that the US Middle East envoy Brett McGurk was in Cairo and would continue "active" discussions in the region on a new deal to bring home hostages and secure a humanitarian pause."The conversations are very sober and serious," Mr Kirby told journalists.During a week-long ceasefire in late November, 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were freed out of more than 250 kidnapped in the shocking Hamas cross-border attacks of 7 October, which triggered the war in Gaza.In return, some 240 Palestinian prisoners were released.Israel and Hamas blamed each other for causing the collapse of the truce by rejecting the terms to extend the daily release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian detainees.Now, on both sides, inevitably, there are major differences between what is publicly declared and what may be negotiable.This week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeated that nothing short of "absolute victory" in Gaza can be accepted.Meanwhile, many commentators have suggested that totally destroying Hamas - which has been governing the territory for a decade and a half - is not realistic. However, one thing that Israel and its Western allies are unlikely to compromise on is that Hamas leaders must be removed from power in Gaza, to ensure that there can be no repeat of the attacks three months ago, which killed more than 1,300 people.Interestingly, there have been unconfirmed media reports this week that as part of a ceasefire and hostage release proposal, Israel had made an offer to allow top Hamas leaders in Gaza to relocate to other countries. Hamas claimed it had rejected such a proposal.With more than 25,000 people now killed in Gaza, according to local health officials, and a catastrophic humanitarian situation, international calls for a ceasefire have become much harder for Israel to ignore.Meanwhile, noisy protests and rallies by the families of Israeli hostages ensure their demand to bring home their loved ones has become a priority of domestic politics. They have overwhelming public sympathy.The latest Israeli reports denying that negotiations with Hamas over a potential hostage release deal are progressing will be a cause for general anxiety.Unnamed diplomatic officials are being quoted by various Israeli media saying that suggestions of positive developments are "fake". They blame Hamas for a failure to compromise.With mediators no doubt rushing to try to shore up the process, the most encouraging sign may be that neither Israel nor Hamas has yet indicated it is abandoning the latest rounds of indirect talks.	
24/01/2024 12:17:00	Scottish grandfather unable to leave Dubai over party noise row - BBC News	A grandfather from Aberdeenshire is unable to leave Dubai following a row with neighbours over a Hogmanay party.Ian Mackellar, 74, and his wife, of Newtonhill, had been visiting their daughter and young granddaughter in the United Arab Emirates when he went to complain about music noise.However he was then reported to the police, accused of trespassing. The ongoing investigation means he is not allowed to leave the country.His anxious wife Carol, 71, told BBC Scotland News: "We have no idea when Ian will be allowed to come home. The family are all very distressed."The Foreign Office has said it is providing assistance.Mrs Mackellar is hoping the authorities in Dubai will look on the case "favourably", as there had been "no evil intent" in what happened.She said they had travelled over last month to help their daughter settle in the country.However things turned sour when Mr Mackellar went to ask neighbours to turn down music on the night of 31 December as family members were trying to sleep."The music was like being in a nightclub several doors down, it was bouncing," Mrs Mackellar said.She said her husband went to have a "neighbour-to-neighbour" chat to ask them to turn it down a bit.But she said some people became "aggressive", and that one person threw a drink.Mrs Mackellar said the police then came to their door two days later and informed them of the trespass complaint.Mrs Mackellar has now returned home, in time for a hospital appointment she had.She said her husband also had health worries, including a heart issue."I am very worried about his state of health and mind," she said. "He's very stressed, and he's worried about me."She said what had happened was all over "something so insignificant"."He's such a placid man," she said. "He's a devoted dad and husband."We have been married for 49 years and have never really been apart. I just want him home."Detained in Dubai is an organisation which aims to help foreigners abroad.Lawyer and Detained in Dubai chief executive Radha Stirling told BBC Scotland there were fears Mr Mackellar could ultimately face two years or more in jail."He definitely faces lengthy incarceration," she said.“This is a very sad situation. Nobody would ever imagine that a polite request to turn the music down would result in a travel ban and criminal prosecution."She explained: "Certainly in other cases we've seen MPs in Scotland get involved with diplomatic support and even arranging meetings with the UAE's ambassador to the UK."And in all of these cases that sort of support at the MP level motivates the FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) to become involved, and also they can reach out and speak to their counterparts at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  in the UAE and highlight the absurdity of this case."A Foreign Office spokesperson confirmed: “We are providing consular assistance to a British man in Dubai.”The Government of Dubai Media Office has been approached for comment.	
24/01/2024 11:52:00	Iraq condemns 'irresponsible' US air strikes on Iran-backed groups - BBC News	The Iraqi government has strongly condemned US strikes which targeted sites used by Iranian-backed groups in Iraq on Wednesday.A spokesperson for Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said they "blatantly" violated his country's sovereignty.The US said its "proportionate" attacks had targeted "Iran-affiliated groups".The paramilitary Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) said the "treacherous" US action killed one of their fighters. The PMF, which is dominated by Iran-backed Shia Muslim militias, said a number of other fighters were injured in strikes on their bases in al-Qaim, a town on the Syrian border in western Anbar province, and in Jurf al-Nasr, in the central province of Babil.US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes on three facilities belonging to the Kataib Hezbollah militia and other groups were "in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks" against US and other international forces in Iraq and Syria.Major General Yehia Rasool, a spokesman for Prime Minister Sudani, said in a statement that the US action was "contributing to a reckless escalation"."This unacceptable act undermines years of co-operation... at a time when the region is already grappling with the danger of expanding conflict, the repercussions of the aggression on Gaza," he added, referring to the war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas.He added that Iraq would treat the US operations "as acts of aggression" against its people on their land, and urged the international community to help restore peace.Writing on X, formerly Twitter, Iraq national security adviser Qassem al-Aaraji said the US action would "not help bring calm". He added that "the US should pile on pressure for a halt to the Israeli offensive in Gaza rather than targeting and bombing the bases of an Iraqi national body".Last week, four US military personnel were injured in a ballistic missile and rocket attack on Iraq's Al Asad air base, in Anbar province.The Pentagon said on Tuesday that they had returned to duty and that there was no significant damage to facilities.The US military's Central Command (Centcom) said an Iran-backed militia targeted the air base, which hosts American troops.The Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed it was behind that attack. The umbrella group emerged in late 2023 and is comprised of several Iran-affiliated militias operating in Iraq. It has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks.Mr Austin said: "We do not seek to escalate conflict in the region. We are fully prepared to take further measures to protect our people and our facilities." "We call on these groups and their Iranian sponsors to immediately cease these attacks."In a separate statement, Centcom said the strikes were carried out at 00:15 local time on Wednesday (21:15 GMT Tuesday)."These strikes targeted [Kataib Hezbollah] headquarters, storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack UAV capabilities," it added, without mentioning their locations.Kataib Hezbollah, or Brigades of the Party of God, is a powerful Iraqi Shia militia that receives financial and military support from Iran. It is believed to have strong links with Iran's Quds Force, the overseas operations arm of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps.Since 2009, the US has designated the group as a terrorist organisation, accusing it of attacking US and Iraqi forces in Iraq on behalf of Iran, and of threatening Iraq's stability. Saturday's attack on Al Asad air base followed a US drone strike in Baghdad earlier this month in which a high-ranking PMF commander was killed.US troops in Iraq and Syria have been attacked dozens of times by Iran-aligned fighters since the war in Gaza started in October.The US and UK have also carried out strikes on Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement in response to its missile and drone attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.Meanwhile, Iran has carried out a number of missile strikes over the last week against targets in Syria, Iraq and Pakistan, which it claimed were linked to the Islamic State group, Israel and a Baloch separatist group respectively.Last Saturday, Iran accused Israel of carrying out an air strike in the Syrian capital, Damascus, which killed five senior members of Iran's security forces.	
23/01/2024 21:15:00	Khan Younis: Israel says forces have encircled Gaza's second city - BBC News	The Israeli military says its ground forces have encircled Khan Younis, the southern Gaza Strip's largest city. Troops have also reportedly advanced deeper into remaining parts of the city, where they believe Hamas leaders are hiding in tunnels with hostages.Residents said tanks had shut the last road out of the city to the Mediterranean coast, effectively stopping them from fleeing southwards.There was also intense fighting around the city's two main hospitals.It came as funerals took place for some of the 24 Israeli soldiers killed on Monday on the deadliest day for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since the start of its ground offensive in Gaza 12 weeks ago.At least 195 Palestinians were also killed in Gaza over the previous 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.The ministry says more than 25,400 people have been killed - mostly children and women - during the war between Hamas and Israel.It was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,300 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 250 others taken hostage.Israeli ground forces expanded their operation into southern Gaza in early December, after largely taking control of Hamas strongholds in the north.Within days they were said to have reached the "heart" of Khan Younis, where hundreds of thousands of people who had fled northern areas were sheltering.But the troops have since faced fierce resistance from Hamas's Khan Younis Brigade. It is considered to be one of the two strongest in the group, which is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other countries. The Israeli operation has expanded and intensified in recent days, with dozens of people reported killed in air and artillery strikes on Monday alone as tanks pushed into the west and centre of the city.On Tuesday, the IDF put out a statement saying that over the past day its troops had "carried out an extensive operation during which they encircled Khan Yunis and deepened the operation in the area". The troops had "engaged in close-quarters combat, directed [air] strikes, and used intelligence to co-ordinate fire, resulting in the elimination of dozens of terrorists", it added.The IDF also ordered residents of western Khan Younis to move immediately to the al-Mawasi area, on the Mediterranean coast, for their own safety.However, some witnesses said tanks had blocked the road leading there, preventing them from joining the estimated million people currently sheltering to the south in Rafah, on the border with Egypt."I am trying to leave for Rafah but the tanks are now very near to the coast and are firing toward the west," Shaban, an electrical engineer with four children, told Reuters news agency.The World Health Organization meanwhile said it was deeply concerned by reports of attacks on hospitals in Khan Younis.On Tuesday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said a civilian had been killed by an Israeli drone at the entrance of Al-Amal Hospital, which it runs, and that others had been injured when shells struck its nearby headquarters. "The situation remains extremely dangerous. Early this morning, there was direct artillery shelling of the Palestine Red Crescent's headquarters on the fourth floor. Israeli drones did not stop firing at people at al-Amal Hospital," spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh told the BBC from Ramallah. "[There is] panic and fear among thousands of displaced people who are taking shelter inside our facilities."There was no immediate comment from the IDF, but it has previously accused Hamas fighters of embedding themselves among the civilian population and operating in and around medical facilities.Ms Farsakh also said ambulances were "facing significant challenges to reach wounded people and transport them to hospitals", adding that they were now being told to take critical cases to Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza. And she warned that Al-Amal and the nearby Nasser Medical Complex - the largest of the 14 hospitals still partly working in Gaza - were "overwhelmed and overcrowded".Dr Haytham Ahmad, who works in Nasser's emergency department, told the BBC that multiple amputations were being performed, and that in some cases, patients were not being given anaesthetic because of a shortage of supplies."These cases have severe crush injuries and there is just some skin and muscle still connected. We try to use limited anaesthetic in this situation," he said.A World Health Organization spokesman said Nasser was "now basically besieged" and that there was "no way in and out" for its 400 patients, as well as the medical staff treating them and displaced civilians.Gaza's health ministry alleged that Israeli forces had fired "heavily on the upper floors of the specialised surgery building and the emergency building" of the hospital.One video filmed by a Palestinian journalist appeared to show gunfire hitting the hospital's western corner, while in another clip smoke is seen rising from an area to the south. The IDF told AFP news agency that it was "not aware of the event".Later, UN Secretary General António Guterres said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was "appalling" and that the entire population was "enduring destruction at a scale and speed without parallel in recent history". He also once again appealed for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman said it was "engaging in serious discussions with both sides" on a potential deal, and a Palestinian official told the BBC that a Hamas delegation had arrived in Cairo on Tuesday morning to "discuss new proposals" with Egypt's intelligence minister.Israel has not denied that it has proposed a two-month truce, involving the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. But there are reports that has already been rejected by Hamas, which demands a permanent ceasefire.	
23/01/2024 19:59:00	Israel-Gaza war: IDF says 24 soldiers killed in Gaza in one day - BBC News	 The Israeli army says 24 of its soldiers were killed in Gaza on Monday - the deadliest day for its forces since their ground operation began.That includes 21 reservists who died in an explosion likely caused by mines that Israeli forces had placed in two buildings to demolish them, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. The IDF later said rocket-propelled grenade fire triggered the explosion."A militant squad surprised the force with RPG fire," a spokesman said."The first rocket hit one of the buildings in which explosives had been laid out. The hit apparently led to the explosion that caused the collapse of the building and the building next to it," Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari added.According to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, 195 Palestinians have been killed in the past day.In an earlier briefing, Rear Admiral Hagari said the reservists were killed in central Gaza at around 16:00 (14:00 GMT) on Monday - close to the kibbutz of Kissufim on the Israeli side of the border. They were involved in an operation to allow for residents of southern Israel to safely return to their homes after tens of thousands were evacuated after the Hamas attack on 7 October.The first funerals for those killed in the explosion have been held at Mount Herzl in a rainy Jerusalem. Many of the mourners wore military uniforms and the scene was full of blue and white Israeli flags.  Israel's military had already confirmed that three officers were killed in a separate attack in southern Gaza on Monday.The country's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that despite its suffering, his country would push on with its offensive until it had "absolute victory."Elsewhere in Gaza, there has been fierce fighting by three hospitals in Khan Younis in the south, which is crowded with displaced people.  The IDF announced it has completely encircled the city, which has been a main focus of its ground offensive targeting Hamas.Israel believes that the group's leaders may be hiding there and that it may also be where some Israeli hostages are being held. According to the IDF, dozens of local gunmen were killed in its operation and its forces found rockets in rocket-launchers ready to fire, as well as tunnel shafts and a large number of weapons.The Palestinians said that women and children have been killed in the latest fighting in the city. They added that Israeli blockades and the storming of hospitals since Monday had left the wounded and dead beyond the reach of rescuers.The dead were being buried inside the grounds of Nasser hospital because it has been unsafe to leave in order to reach the cemetery.  It is said that Israeli forces stormed another hospital, Al-Khair - which is in the al-Mawasi area to the west - and arrested staff.  Israel launched the war with the declared aim of destroying Hamas after waves of its gunmen killed 1,300 people - mostly civilians - and took about 250 others hostage in the unprecedented attack.According to the IDF website, 217 soldiers have been killed since the beginning of Israel's ground invasion on 27 October out of a total of 552 killed since 7 October.At least 25,490 people - mainly women and children - have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.	
23/01/2024 18:51:00	Worthing man running length of Africa halted by visa issue - BBC News	A man running the length of Africa for charity has said the challenge could be in doubt over visa issues.Russell Cook, from Worthing, West Sussex, had planned to complete the length of 360 marathons in 240 days.After complications including an armed robbery, the 26-year-old was forced to extend the challenge.Mr Cook said it was now dependent on whether he could secure permission to cross the border into Algeria from Mauritania.Posting on X (formerly Twitter), he said: "I've been on the road for 278 days, ran 12,000km [7,456 miles] across 13 different countries, raised over £140,000 for charity - but it is all hanging in the balance," he said. "If we don't get the visas, then it is game over."Tim Loughton, the Conservative MP for East Worthing responded to the message: "Russ-have been sent this and I gather that you are from East Worthing. Can you email me some details and we will do what we can to help through the Foreign Office and Algerian Embassy."Alexander Stafford MP also said he would help by raising the issue with the Algerian ambassador.The extreme challenge began at South Africa's most southerly point on 22 April and will finish at Tunisia's most northerly point.Mr Cook had originally aimed to cover 9,320 miles (14,500km) during the challenge, crossing 16 borders, but extended the challenge due to complications with his visas, health scares and geopolitical issues.Mr Cook, nicknamed "Hardest Geezer", has called for the assistance and support of those who have followed the challenge to help secure the visa. "It's the only option we've got," he said. "There is literally no other way to get to the most northern tip of Africa for us."The challenge is in aid of The Running Charity and has raised £142,659 so far.Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

23/01/2024 17:26:00	UK not seeking confrontation with Houthis - Sunak - BBC News	The UK will not hesitate to take further military action against Houthi targets in Yemen if the group continues Red Sea attacks, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has told MPs.Mr Sunak said the UK was not seeking confrontation with the Iran-backed group, but would continue to act in self-defence. It follows overnight strikes with the US in Yemen.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he backed the "targeted action".Four RAF Typhoons and two Voyager tankers took part in a second wave of joint US-UK action against the Houthis on Monday night, following previous raids on 11 January. They targeted two military sites used to support attacks on shipping north of Yemen's capital, Sanaa. The prime minister said all intended targets were destroyed.Addressing the House of Commons on Tuesday, Mr Sunak said: "We are not seeking a confrontation. We urge the Houthis and those who enable them to stop these illegal and unacceptable attacks."But, if necessary, the United Kingdom will not hesitate to respond again in self-defence.""Maximum care" was taken to protect civilians in the strikes, he added. No civilians have died as a result of the strikes.Sir Keir was not briefed beforehand, but Downing Street said he and Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle were informed while British fighter jets were in the air at about 22:00 on Monday.Since November, the Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels travelling through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. The group says it is targeting ships linked to Israel in response to the military ground operation in Gaza. However, many of the vessels which have been attacked have no connection with Israel.Yemen's internationally recognised government, which is now based in Riyadh, Saudia Arabia, has condemned Houthi attacks.What was originally intended to be a short, sharp shock for the Houthis has now descended into a repetitive tit-for-tat. The latest strikes will have made a dent in their arsenal.But the Houthis, who took over much of Yemen 10 years ago, have a large supply of missiles and drones and show every sign of continuing their attacks on shipping, undeterred by the eight US-led air strikes so far this year. The US and UK have little choice but to continue hitting Houthi targets as long as their attacks continue - to give up now would be tantamount to ceding control of a crucial global shipping route to a proscribed terror group backed by Iran.So far, the strikes have been precise and calibrated with minimal human casualties, but that may change. The longer these exchanges carry on, the greater the risk of escalation. There is a real risk that in due course Yemeni civilians may die in these retaliatory air strikes, which could ignite a wave of anti-western anger across the wider Middle East.The Houthis have vowed vengeance against US and British interests, believing they have God on their side. They have survived eight years of civil war and countless airstrikes by their neighbour, Saudi Arabia. They have strategic patience, claiming they will outlast their western adversaries.They also accuse the US and UK of supporting Israel with its military action against them. But Mr Sunak said there was "no link between our actions of self-defence in the Red Sea and the situation in Israel and Gaza". "Those who make that link do the Houthis' work for them," he told MPs. There have been at least 12 further attacks by the Houthis since 11 January, including on Monday night ahead of the latest strikes.Incidents have increased in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since the first wave of US-UK strikes. But the prime minister insisted the latest British military action had worked to "degrade capability", though noted there "may be a difference between reducing and eliminating" the threat. "The targets are specifically selected on the basis of intelligence, military sites which impact the security and safety of seafarers and shipping, and to that end I'm confident the strikes are being carried out in a way that's effective and achieving their aim," he told MPs.Mr Sunak said action against the Houthis had been a "last resort" and only after repeated warnings had been ignored, adding that the UK in both waves of attacks had acted in order to "protect innocent lives and preserve the freedom of navigation".The government's aim is to stop the illegal sale of weapons to the Houthis and impose sanctions to cut off the group's financial resources, he added.The government has published the legal advice it received for the operation, which concluded the strikes were legal under international law. Sir Keir Starmer backed the strikes and said attacks on vessels needed to stop. "They are designed to destabilise us so we must stand united and strong, they bring danger to ordinary civilians who are working hard at sea, so we must protect them, and they aim to disrupt the flow of goods, food and medicines, so we must not let them go unaddressed," he said.A "general debate" on military action in the region will take place in the Commons on Wednesday. MPs will not be asked to consider and vote on a specific motion. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who has called for a vote, said his party accepted the case for the strikes but that there had been "remarkably little clarity about what the next steps are and when the UK's objectives will be judged to have been fulfilled".Downing Street has defended the decision not to consult Parliament first, arguing that the government was "acting with precedent" and that "there isn't a requirement to hold a vote".Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron will be visiting the region this week. 	
23/01/2024 17:07:00	'I go to sleep a dead man' - father's pain at daughter's captivity in Gaza - BBC News	On 7 October Eli Albag's daughter Liri was taken into Gaza as a hostage following the Hamas attacks on Israel that day."I wake up in the morning alive and go to sleep dead. Each day," says Eli as he tries to cope with the pain of 18-year-old Liri's ordeal, and his own inability to keep her safe.Standing outside the Houses of Parliament, he holds two images of Liri, before and after she was taken captive. The contrast is heartbreaking.In the latter - a still from a video made by Hamas after the capture - Liri looks dishevelled, with dirt pictured on her face and hoodie."I couldn't sleep for three days because I see my daughter in shock," Mr Albag says."I want to show to the world. This is the same girl, it is not different girls. This is Liri freedom, a girl of peace and love," he says pointing to the first picture. "And this is Liri in the hands of the Hamas. You see the difference. You can see in the eyes and the face. "She see the dead, she see people with guns on her head and she see murdered girls in front of her for two hours."Mr Albag is one of four relatives of hostages who have come to London to lobby the UK Government to put pressure on Qatar, which is involved in talks to release the hostages but also hosts a number of senior Hamas leaders.They say they want the Gulf state to choose whether it wants to continue to host Hamas or be "part of Western civilisation".Israel says more than 130 people remain unaccounted for after they were abducted during the Hamas attacks. More than 100 captives were released during a six-day ceasefire at the end of November.Adding to Mr Albag's pain is the fear that Liri may have been sexually abused by her captors.He told the BBC that he thought released former hostages who spent time with his daughter Liri knew something about this but avoided telling him to spare him any grief.Some released hostages have said they were told directly by other female hostages that they had been sexually assaulted. A report by the Associated Press quoted doctors as saying that 10 of those released were assaulted or abused.Also, the BBC has seen and heard evidence of sexual violence against women on the day of the 7 October attacks."We know that some of the girls - it's very difficult to say this - they attacked them, sexually, and we are worried, especially that they didn't release them," Liri's father said.He added that there were women aged between 18 and 30 who had not been released.The former hostages would not respond to his "difficult questions" about sexual abuse and moved their eyes away, he said."I understand they don't want to talk about this, they don't want to hurt us. But we understand. We really understand," he says.Mr Albag says Liri is his youngest daughter, the "happiest, who liked music, who liked to dance" and who had "friends all over the world".He is a self-confessed tough guy but he is unable to sleep and often unable to talk because of what he thinks could be happening to her."All the family's broken, she has two sisters and a young brother, and from 7 October we are not living," he says. "I wake up in the morning alive and go to sleep dead. Each day. This is what's happened to us, no day no night."He says he knows from the released hostages that his daughter was alive and physically unhurt after 50 days of captivity, though they were living in a tunnel with no food, no water, no fresh air and no electricity. She was unable to have a shower for that whole period, he adds."It is our hope that we can receive her back, in good condition," he says.But his fears have led to other fears.More than three months since the hostages were taken, it could soon be too late for any unwanted pregnancies - resulting from rape - to be terminated. Mr Albag says: "The clock is ticking, there is a limit of time to stop it."Later on Monday the four Israelis attended a Conservative Friends of Israel meeting. Eli Albag handed UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak a dog tag with the words "Bring them home".Another of the four, Liran Berman, whose brothers Gali and Ziv are still held hostage, explained their message for the Qataris."We know that Qatar is the key player," he said. "They are hosting the leadership of Hamas but they are also investing in Western civilisation, buying football teams and properties in London, in Europe, in the US. "They need to choose a side. If they want to be part of Western civilisation, ok, but they can't host Hamas leaders."A Qatari official responded by offering "deepest sympathies" to the families of the hostages and said they were continuing to engage with all sides, "working around the clock to reunite the hostages with their families and bring an end to the war"."Since the first day of the crisis, Qatar has done everything it can to secure the release of hostages and prevent further bloodshed," the official added. "This includes using its communication channel with Hamas, established over a decade ago in coordination with the United States. "So far, 109 hostages have been released from Gaza through these efforts, while Qatari mediation succeeded last week in reaching an agreement to deliver medicine to hostages and other aid to civilians in Gaza."	
23/01/2024 14:23:00	Mohammad Ghobadlou: Iran executes protester with mental health condition - BBC News	Iran has executed a man who was sentenced to death in connection with mass protests against the clerical establishment, the judiciary says.Mohammad Ghobadlou, 23, was convicted of murder and "corruption on Earth" for allegedly running over a policeman with his car and killing him during a protest near Tehran in September 2022. Rights groups said he faced an unfair trial marred by torture allegations.Appeals to take into account his mental health condition were also rejected.He is the ninth person to have been executed in relation to their involvement in the protests. At least four others are believed to be under sentence of death and 15 others are at risk of being handed the death penalty.The nationwide unrest was triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly wearing her hijab "improperly".Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands detained in a violent crackdown by security forces, which have portrayed the protests as "riots".The judiciary-run Mizan news agency said Mohammad Ghobadlou's death penalty was implemented on Tuesday morning, after being upheld by the Supreme Court. Videos posted on social media showed members of his family - reportedly including his mother and aunt - crying out in anguish at the gates of Qazalhasar prison in Karaj, moments after he was hanged. According to BBC Persian, one woman can be heard telling prison guards: "You killed my Mohammed. He took to the streets for all of the young people." On Monday night, Ghobadlou's mother had made an emotional, videotaped appeal to the family of the policeman he was convicted of killing, asking them not to enforce the punishment of "qisas", or retribution in kind.She had previously urged the judiciary to take into consideration that her son had been diagnosed bipolar disorder as a teenager and had stopped taking his medication two months before the protests, diminishing his responsibility.Ghobadlou's lawyer, Amir Raesian, wrote on X on Monday evening that the execution would be illegal and amount to "murder". He argued that the Supreme Court had in July struck down the death sentence because of his client's mental health condition.However, Mizan reported that Mr Raesian's claim was not true, saying the Supreme Court had twice rejected such appeals. Amnesty International said last year that Ghobadlou had received two death sentences after "grossly unfair sham trials marred by torture-tainted 'confessions' and failure to order rigorous mental health assessments despite his mental disability". According to information obtained by the human rights group, he was denied access to a lawyer by investigators following his arrest and that he was subjected to repeated beatings and not given his bipolar medication in order to force his "confession". It said he was also denied an independently chosen lawyer at his trial before the Revolutionary Court, which consisted of two brief sessions in October and November 2022. At his two Criminal Court trial sessions that December, the lawyer he appointed was denied access to material evidence.Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, director of the Norway-based group Iran Human Rights, denounced Ghobadlou's execution as "an extrajudicial killing"."The Islamic Republic's leader Ali Khamenei and his judiciary must be held accountable for this crime," he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.After learning on Monday that the execution was imminent, imprisoned human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi had called on Iranians to express their solidarity with Ghobadlou's family. "The execution of Ghobadlou is a deliberate act of murder & a crime & in the face of murder, silence is betrayal," she wrote in a post on a Threads account run by relatives. "Don't leave Mohammad's family alone. Let's stand with them tonight. Anyone in any way possible, shout: 'Do not execute!'"	
23/01/2024 11:47:00	US and UK launch fresh strikes on Houthis in Yemen - BBC News	The US and UK have conducted a fresh series of joint air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.The Pentagon said Monday's strikes hit eight targets, including an underground storage site and Houthi missile and surveillance capability.The Iran-backed Houthis have been targeting ships they say are linked to Israel and the West that travel through the important Red Sea trade route.The US and UK said they were trying to protect the "free flow of commerce".A joint statement issued by the Pentagon confirmed "an additional round of proportionate and necessary strikes" against the Houthis.The statement added: "Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, but let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: we will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world's most critical waterways in the face of continued threats."On Tuesday the Pentagon said its assessment was that the strikes destroyed or degraded more than 25 missile launch and deployment facilities. This is the eighth strike by the US against Houthi targets in Yemen. It is the second joint operation with the UK, after joint strikes were carried out on 11 January. Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron told reporters the UK had sent a "clear message" and that it will "continue to degrade" the Houthis' ability to carry out attacks.  Asked whether the strikes could escalate tensions in the Middle East, Lord Cameron said it was the Houthis who were escalating the situation and he was "confident" the previous strikes had been effective.He went on to say the Houthis' narrative that the strikes were related to the war between Israel and Hamas "shouldn't be accepted", and the UK wants to see a "swift end to the conflict" in Gaza. Lord Cameron said the UK had called for an "immediate humanitarian pause" and that "we want it to turn into permanent, sustainable ceasefire". It is a plan he will put forward when visiting the region this week, he said. The joint statement said the strikes were carried out with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will give a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon, addressing the UK's decision to conduct further strikes. Opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer was not told about the strikes before they happened, but was seen arriving at the Cabinet Office this morning for a confidential briefing.US fighter jets from the carrier USS Eisenhower were involved in Monday's strikes. Four RAF Typhoons, supported by a pair of Voyager tankers, joined the US forces, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said. "Our aircraft used Paveway IV precision guided bombs to strike multiple targets at two military sites in the vicinity of Sanaa airfield. These locations were being used to enable the continued intolerable attacks against international shipping in the Red Sea," the MoD said."In line with UK standard practice, a very rigorous analysis was applied in planning the strikes to minimise any risk of civilian casualties, and as with the previous strikes, our aircraft bombed at night to mitigate yet further any such risks," it added.Government minister Huw Merriman told Sky News the airstrikes would "not just be a one-off", if the Houthis continue to attack ships in the Red Sea. UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps described the strikes as "self defence" against the Houthis' "intolerable attacks" on merchant shipping. "Aimed at degrading Houthi capabilities this action will deal another blow to their limited stockpiles and ability to threaten global trade," he wrote on X.Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said the party was "concerned about the Houthis' attacks in the Red Sea" and they "support the case for limited strikes", but that it was "absolutely vital that Parliament has an opportunity to have its say, via a debate and a vote". Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported strikes in Yemen's Sanaa, Taiz and Bayda provinces, including the al-Dailami air base near the capital Sanaa.Ten days after the first carefully calibrated joint air and missile strike by the US and UK, the Houthis remain defiant. They have continued to launch a variety of projectiles at shipping passing Yemen's coastline, in one case mistakenly targeting a ship carrying Russian oil. Under the newly named Operation Poseidon Archer, US-led strikes have now hit fresh targets, after previously carrying out a number of pre-emptive strikes on Houthi launch sites. These, say the Pentagon, destroyed missiles just as they were being prepared for launch. Western intelligence recently estimated that at least 30% of Houthi missile stocks had been destroyed or degraded. Yet the Houthis, who are supplied, trained and advised by Iran, are clearly bent on continuing their attacks on shipping they suspect of being linked to Israel, the US or the UK. These have earned them much popularity at home, where many Yemenis have been chafing under their brutal rule. They are also popular with many across the wider Arab world since the Houthis say they are supporting Hamas as part of the Iran-backed 'Axis of Resistance' against Israel.It comes after US President Joe Biden and Mr Sunak spoke earlier on Monday.In an official readout of their phone call, the White House said Mr Biden and Mr Sunak "discussed ongoing Iranian-backed Houthi attacks against merchant and naval vessels transiting the Red Sea".They reiterated "their commitment to freedom of navigation, international commerce, and defending mariners from illegal and unjustifiable attacks", the White House said.It added: "The president and prime minister discussed the importance of increasing humanitarian aid and civilian protections for people in Gaza, and securing the release of hostages held by Hamas."The Houthis began attacking merchant vessels in November, saying they were responding to Israel's military ground operation in Gaza. Since then, the group has launched dozens of attacks on commercial tankers passing through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.In response, the US and UK launched a wave of air strikes against dozens of Houthi targets on 11 January. Those strikes - also supported by Australia, Bahrain, the Netherlands and Canada - began after Houthi forces ignored an ultimatum to cease attacks in the region.	
23/01/2024 15:00:00	Latest US-UK strikes on Houthis in Yemen were self-defence - Sunak - BBC News		
23/01/2024 02:50:00	UAE has funded political assassinations in Yemen, BBC finds - BBC News	The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has funded politically motivated assassinations in Yemen, a BBC investigation has found.Training provided by American mercenaries - hired by the UAE in 2015 - has then been used by Emiratis to instruct locals, sparking a surge in targeted killings, a whistleblower says.The findings come as conflict in Yemen has returned to the international spotlight following attacks on ships in the Red Sea. The UAE government has denied the allegations in our investigation - that it had assassinated those without links to terrorism - saying they were "false and without merit". The killing spree in Yemen - more than 100 assassinations in a three-year period - is just one element of an ongoing bitter internecine conflict pitting several international powers against each other in the Middle East's poorest country. The deadly atmosphere has discouraged the permanent return of Yemen's internationally recognised government. This, it could be argued, has indirectly helped to embolden the Iran-backed Houthis. Washington has announced that it will now re-designate the group as "global terrorists".I have been reporting on the conflict in my native Yemen since it began in 2014. The fighting led to the government losing control of the country's north to the Houthis - who over the years have become savvier and better equipped. In 2015, the US and the UK supported a coalition of mostly Arab states led by Saudi Arabia - with the UAE as a key partner - to fight back. The coalition invaded Yemen with the aim of reinstating the exiled Yemeni government and fighting terrorism. The UAE was given charge of security in the south, and became the US's key ally on counter-terrorism in the region - al-Qaeda had long been a presence in the south and was now gaining territory. American mercenaries: Killing in YemenBBC Arabic's Nawal al-Maghafi reveals how the UAE hired mercenaries to conduct targeted assassinations of its political enemies in Yemen, with American mercenaries starting the killings in 2015.Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or on BBC Two at 23:15 on Tuesday 23 January (23:45 in Northern Ireland), or on YouTube (outside UK).Listen to Nawal al-Maghafi's radio documentary on Assignment on the BBC World Service and on BBC Sounds from Thursday 25 January.But instead of this establishing greater stability, during my frequent reporting trips at that time I witnessed a wave of mysterious targeted killings, in Yemeni government-controlled southern areas, of Yemeni citizens unconnected to terror groups. Under international law, any killing of civilians without due process would be counted as extra-judicial. The majority of those assassinated were members of Islah - the Yemeni branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. It is a popular international Sunni Islamist movement which has never been classified by the US as a terror organisation, but is banned in several Arab countries - including the UAE where its political activism and support for elections is seen by the country's royal family as a threat to their rule. Drone footage of the first assassination mission, leaked to BuzzFeed News and first reported in 2018, gave me a starting point from which to investigate these mysterious killings. It was dated December 2015 and was traced to members of a private US security company called Spear Operations Group.I finally met one of the men behind the operation shown in the footage in a restaurant in London in 2020. Isaac Gilmore, a former US Navy Seal who later became chief operating officer of Spear, was one of several Americans who say they were hired to carry out assassinations in Yemen by the UAE.He refused to talk about anyone who was on the "kill list" provided to Spear by the UAE - other than the target of their first mission: Ansaf Mayo, a Yemeni MP who is the leader of Islah in the southern port city of Aden, the government's temporary capital since 2015.I confronted Mr Gilmore over the fact that Islah had never been classified as a terrorist organisation by the US authorities."Modern conflicts are unfortunately very opaque," he said. "We see this in Yemen - one person's civil leader and cleric, is another person's terrorist leader."Mr Gilmore, and another Spear employee in Yemen at the time - Dale Comstock - told me that the mission they conducted ended in 2016. But the assassinations in southern Yemen continued. In fact they became more frequent, according to investigators from the human rights group Reprieve.They investigated 160 killings carried out in Yemen between 2015 and 2018. They said the majority happened from 2016 and only 23 of the 160 people killed had links to terrorism. All the killings had been carried out using the same tactics that Spear had employed - the detonation of an improvised explosive device (IED) as a distraction, followed by a targeted shooting.   The most recent political assassination in Yemen, according to Yemeni human rights lawyer Huda al-Sarari, happened just last month - of an imam killed in Lahj by the same method. Mr Gilmore, Mr Comstock, and two other mercenaries from Spear who asked not to be named, said that Spear had been involved in training Emirati officers in the UAE military base in Aden. A journalist who asked to remain anonymous also told us he had seen footage of such training. The mercenaries would not go into detail about what it had entailed, but a senior Yemeni military officer from Aden, who worked directly with the UAE himself, gave me more details.As the mercenaries' profile had made them conspicuous in Aden and vulnerable to exposure, their brief had been changed to training Emirati officers, "who in turn trained local Yemenis to do the targeting", the Yemeni military officer told me. Through the course of the investigation, we also spoke to more than a dozen other Yemeni sources who said this had been the case. They included two men who said they had carried out assassinations which were not terror-related, after being trained to do so by Emirati soldiers - and one man who said he had been offered release from a UAE prison in exchange for the assassination of a senior Yemeni political figure, a mission he did not accept. Getting Yemenis to conduct the assassinations meant it was harder for the killings to be traced back to the UAE.By 2017, the UAE had helped build a paramilitary force, part of the Emirati-funded Southern Transitional Council (STC), a security organisation that runs a network of armed groups across southern Yemen.The force operated in southern Yemen independently of the Yemeni government, and would only take orders from the UAE. The fighters were not just trained to fight on active front lines. One particular unit, the elite Counter Terrorism Unit, was trained to conduct assassinations, our whistleblower told us.The BBC has found that despite the American mercenaries' stated aim to eliminate the jihadist groups al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS) in southern Yemen, in fact the UAE has gone on to recruit former al-Qaeda members for this security force.The whistleblower sent a document with 11 names of former al-Qaeda members now working in the STC, some of whose identities we were able to verify ourselves. During our investigation we also came across the name Nasser al-Shiba. Once a high-ranking al-Qaeda operative, he was jailed for terrorism but later released. A Yemeni government minister we spoke to told us al-Shiba was a known suspect in the attack on the US warship USS Cole, which killed 17 American sailors in October 2000. Multiple sources told us that he is now the commander of one of the STC military units.Lawyer Huda al-Sarari has been investigating human rights abuses committed by these UAE-backed forces on the ground. As a result of her work, she would frequently receive death threats. But it was her 18-year-old son Mohsen who paid the ultimate price. He was shot in the chest in March 2019 while on a trip to a local petrol station, and died a month later. When Huda returned to work after his death, she says she received messages warning her to stop. "Was one son not enough? Do you want us to kill the other?" they said. A subsequent investigation by Aden's public prosecutor found that Mohsen was killed by a member of the UAE-backed Counter Terrorism Unit, but the authorities have never pursued a prosecution. Members of the prosecutor's office - who we cannot name for safety reasons - told us that the widespread assassinations have created a climate of fear that means even they are too afraid to pursue justice in cases involving forces backed by the UAE.Reprieve has received a leaked UAE document that shows Spear was still being paid in 2020, though it is not clear in what capacity. We asked Spear's founder, Abraham Golan, whether his mercenaries had trained Emiratis in assassination techniques, but he didn't respond. We put the allegations in our investigation to the UAE government. It said it was untrue that it had targeted individuals with no links to terrorism, and that it supported counter-terrorism operations in Yemen at the invitation of the government of Yemen and its international allies. "The UAE has acted in compliance with applicable international law during these operations," it said.We asked the US Department of Defense and the State Department to talk to us about Spear Operations Group, but they declined. And the US government's intelligence agency said in a statement: "The idea that the CIA signed off on such an operation is false."Update 29th January: This article originally referred to leaked drone footage of the first assassination mission and linked to a BuzzFeed article reporting that story by journalist Aram Roston. We subsequently updated this sentence to make clear that this was first reported by BuzzFeed News in 2018 and that the footage had been leaked directly to them.	
23/01/2024 00:23:00	Navy Seals presumed dead after anti-Houthi mission - BBC News	Two US Navy Seals who went missing during an operation to seize Iranian-made weapons - bound for Houthis in Yemen - are now presumed dead, the US military says.The incident took place on 11 January when commandos were boarding a ship off the coast of Somalia. According to media reports, one was swept away and the second jumped in to save him. US Central Command said attempts were being made to recover the bodies."We mourn the loss of our two Naval Special Warfare warriors, and we will forever honour their sacrifice and example," said the head of Central Command (Centcom), Gen Michael Erik Kurilla.The US Navy identified the two as 27-year-old Navy Special Warfare Operator 2nd Class Nathan Gage Ingram and 37-year-old Navy Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Christopher J Chambers.Air and naval units from the US, Japan and Spain spent 10 days searching an area of more than 21,000 sq miles (54,000 sq km) to try to find the commandos, with the help of oceanographers and meteorologists.Navy Seals are members of a specialist maritime military force responsible for tasks including reconnaissance and carrying out covert operations. "These Seals represented the very best of our country, pledging their lives to protect their fellow Americans," US President Joe Biden said in a statement on Monday. "Our hearts go out to the family members, loved ones, friends, and shipmates who are grieving for these two brave Americans."Military officials told the Associated Press the first Seal, Ingram, was swept into heavy seas during the night mission as they were boarding an unflagged dhow - a traditional sailing ship - where the weapons were discovered.The second, Chambers, entered the water to try to save him. Capt Blake L Chaney, commander of Naval Special Warfare Group 1, said in a statement that the two Navy Seals "were exceptional warriors, cherished teammates, and dear friends to many within the Naval Special Warfare community"."Chris and Gage selflessly served their country with unwavering professionalism and exceptional capabilities," Capt Chaney said.Centcom said last week that warheads for Houthi medium-range ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles, as well as parts for air defence systems, were among the items seized. It added that initial analysis indicated the components were for missiles that have been used by the Iran-backed Houthis to target vessels travelling through the Red Sea recently. The supply, sale and transfer of weapons to the Houthis is considered a violation of a 2015 United Nations Security Council resolution, as well as international law. Dozens of vessels have been targeted in the Houthi attacks, leading hundreds of cargo ships and tankers to be rerouted around the southern tip of Africa to avoid the strikes. The Houthis, who support Hamas, say they are only targeting vessels with connections to Israel following the start of the war in Gaza. However, some of the ships they have hit have had no clear connection to Israel.They have also begun attacking ships associated with the US and UK after both countries launched airstrikes against Houthi positions in Yemen in retaliation to the Red Sea attacks. The group controls the country's north, the capital Sanaa and the Red Sea coastline. Both the US and UK say they are not seeking a conflict with the Houthis but are trying to protect the international trade route. 	
22/01/2024 22:33:00	US demands Israel conduct full investigation into Palestinian-American teen's killing - BBC News	The US is calling for a full probe into the murder of a Palestinian-American teenager who died on Friday in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Tawfic Abdel Jabbar, 17, was shot in the head and killed, his family said.Jabbar's family said they believe he was hit by an off-duty Israeli soldier and an Israeli settler who shot at the car he had been driving.The Israeli police said a civilian and an off-duty policeman had fired at someone suspected of hurling rocks.The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said that one of its members was also in the area, and that it is investigating the claim that the soldier had fired shots at the Palestinian teenager.The White House, increasingly at odds with the Israeli government and also facing criticism at home about its handling of the war in Gaza, is pressing for a wide and deep investigation.Calling the death of Jabber "a tragic killing", National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby said that "we have every expectation that those responsible will be held accountable"."We call on Israel to conduct a full, thorough and transparent investigation into his killing," Mr Kirby said at a White House press briefing on Monday. Jabbar's death comes amid rising tensions in the West Bank between Palestinians and Israeli settlers, as the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas in Gaza enters its fourth month. At least 319 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the war broke out on 7 October, according to UN data. Many were killed in shootouts with the Israeli military, but some, witnesses say, were killed by Israeli forces and settlers while they were unarmed.President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are divided over the future of post-war Gaza. Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected US calls for a two-state solution to the conflict, where a Palestinian state would be created next to an Israeli one.Born and raised in Louisiana, Jabbar had travelled to the village of Al-Mara'a Al-Sharqiya, about 10 miles northwest of Ramallah, with his family in May to learn about his Palestinian roots, his family said. His father, Hafeth Abdel Jabbar, told NBC News that his son had hoped to study engineering in college and was considering pursuing a degree in the West Bank.Jabbar's family said he was killed after going out for a picnic with friends. Witnesses told them that the teenager was first shot by a person who appeared to be a settler, followed by someone wearing an IDF uniform.In his interview with NBC, Mr Abdel Jabbar said  he doubts the US government will take action to respond to the killing of his, who, he said, was "very loved".He dismissed the accusation by Israeli authorities that his son was hurling rocks. But he added that even if rocks were thrown, his son should not have been killed."You're gonna shoot the car 10 times because a guy threw a rock?" he asked.	
22/01/2024 22:00:00	UK officials probe Iran generals' antisemitic talks to students - BBC News	Videos of antisemitic speeches by Iranian generals, given to UK students, are being investigated by the Charity Commission. The regulator is also looking at footage of "death to Israel" chants at an Islamic charity's UK premises.Verified by the BBC, two of the videos show talks by members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. One described an apocalyptic war on Jews.The group that promoted the online talks said it respects all communities.The footage - which also includes a denial of the Holocaust - adds to growing concerns from some MPs that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is attempting to radicalise UK Muslims. Security services have also warned it is inciting violence and plotting to kidnap or kill people on British soil.One of the most powerful paramilitary organisations in the Middle East, the IRGC controls the Iranian government's foreign covert operations and supports militant groups such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen.The IRGC has previously been linked to kidnap and assassination plots in the UK. Counter-terror police confirmed in February last year that 15 such plots had come out of Iran since 2020, and the BBC has since been told there has been at least one more.The videos seen by the BBC were recorded in 2020 and 2021 and show three events. Two were live-streamed speeches by former and active IRGC commanders. The other was an in-person event inside the Kanoon Towhid Islamic centre in west London, commemorating Iran's top military commander Gen Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in a US air strike in 2020. Chants of "death to Israel" were heard at the event, but it is not known who was saying them.The BBC has also seen evidence of another online talk to UK students by an IRGC commander who has since boasted of his role in training Hamas before the 7 October attacks.The online talks were promoted in advance by the Islamic Students Associations of Britain (ISA) and its affiliates, which use the Kanoon Towhid centre as a meeting place. Unlike the UK's main Muslim student groups, the ISA was founded to promote the philosophy of the leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini.Kanoon Towhid is owned by the Al-Tawheed (TUCF) Charitable Trust. The trust was already being investigated by the Charity Commission after reports of the event honouring Gen Soleimani, who was sanctioned by the UK for his links to terrorism. The commission is now examining the videos seen by the BBC, which include footage of this event.The commission's chair, Orlando Fraser, has previously warned that charities must not "become forums for hate speech" or extremism. The Charity Commission has the power to investigate, sanction or close down charities which breach the regulations.Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, described the speeches as a "brazen act of radicalisation". She said the IRGC should be added to the list of proscribed terrorist groups in the UK, meaning it would be illegal to be an IRGC member or to show support for them. In one recording - an Instagram Live from Iran in September 2020 which has been viewed about 1,500 times - IRGC commander Hossein Yekta said universities had become "the battlefront" and urged the students listening to become "soft-war officers".Kasra Aarabi - director of IRGC research at the US-based campaign group United Against Nuclear Iran, and who shared the videos with the BBC - said "soft-war officers" is a term used by Iran to describe recruits to its ideological battle with the West. He said it was coined by a branch of the IRGC, "which today is proactively conducting terror plots on British soil".Ali Ansari, a professor of Iranian history at the University of St Andrews, said the talks reflected "an attempt to encourage disruption, discontent, and basically undermine the stability of Western society, and what we need is a much more robust response to it".  Prof Ansari said proscribing the IRGC as a terrorist organisation would be difficult, as it is an arm of the Iranian state. But he said the UK government could still shut down its activities.The other video of an online talk seen by the BBC, this time from January 2021, again glorified the death of Gen Soleimani.Seen by tens of thousands of people, the video shows former IRGC commander Gen Saeed Ghasemi comparing Soleimani's death to the Hollywood film Terminator 2, saying that after Soleimani was attacked, the broken pieces would come back together, stronger than before."You killed Qasem," he said, referring to the US, "but he shattered into millions of hearts in the Islamic world. You can no longer stand in his way."In the footage, Gen Ghasemi also falsely claimed the Holocaust was "a lie and a fake" and described an apocalyptic war that the British students could join to "bring an end to the life of the oppressors and occupiers, Zionists and Jews across the world".He added: "God willing, myself and you good students in Europe will be written in the beautiful list of the soldiers of the resistance from tonight."In addition to the videos, the BBC has seen promotional posts dating from November 2020 for another talk to British students featuring elite former IRGC commander Ezzatollah Zarghami. Mr Zarghami, who is sanctioned in the UK for human rights abuses, posted a picture of himself on his Telegram social media account speaking live over Zoom on the evening of the talk.Mr Zarghami was part of a group of radical students who stormed the US embassy in Tehran in 1979, holding Americans hostage for more than a year. He is currently the minister of Cultural Heritage and Tourism in Iran and has since boasted of training Hamas in Gaza prior to the 7 October attacks. In an interview on Iranian state TV, he also described how he had provided Hamas with missiles.Online adverts for the speeches in the videos displayed the logo of the Islamic Students Associations of Britain. In one of the videos, the association's name is spelled out on the screen in Farsi.And the Instagram Live event from September 2020 was hosted by Mohammadhussain Ataee, a British citizen educated in Yorkshire who was secretary of the Islamic Students Associations of Britain at the time. It is the only video he appears in and he is no longer the secretary of the organisation. However, Mr Ataee is still the secretary of the Union of Islamic Students Associations of Europe - an umbrella body that includes the British organisation. In January last year, he was granted an audience in Tehran with Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Mr Ataee said the allegations against him are false, but would not answer the BBC's questions. He has previously said he does not have direct or indirect affiliation to the IRGC, or any army, government or security group in the world. He added the Islamic Students Associations have never had any "physical gathering in Kanoon Towhid or anywhere else with any of the falsely accused individuals".Mr Ataee also said the students association was a democratic organisation which makes its decisions through an executive committee, not through one person.After watching the footage of IRGC commanders, the foreign affairs committee chair Ms Kearns urged the government to make such events illegal, adding the videos depicted "a risk to the stability of our country"."It makes me really worried about the state of our society, everyone should be horrified by what they're seeing in those videos," she said. "It's division, it's hatred. It's inciting violence, potentially it's incredibly serious."She said the IRGC had to be proscribed and "they are aiding and abetting people who would commit terrorism on our soil".One of the people who says he is under threat is Vahid Beheshti, a British-Iranian journalist and human rights activist. He told the BBC police have warned him his life is at risk."Every day that I wake up, I think this is my last day," said Mr Beheshti, who has been holding a sit-in protest outside the Foreign Office for almost a year. He said in the past few weeks he had been approached and was told: "I'm gonna cut your neck". Mr Beheshti said he believes the small group of people targeting him are IRGC agents, operating freely in the UK.The government says it keeps the list of proscribed organisations under review, but it has a policy not to comment on whether a specific organisation is or is not being considered.A spokesperson said: "We have sanctioned more than 350 Iranian individuals and entities, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in its entirety."The Islamic Students Association of Britain told the BBC it is an independent group led by student volunteers with no affiliations to any government.The association said it respects people from all backgrounds, faiths and communities and "does not support or endorse anyone that does not share these values". It added that "all its activities are clearly lawful".The Al-Tawheed (TUCF) Charitable Trust, which runs the Kanoon Towhid centre, was repeatedly contacted for comment but did not respond.	
22/01/2024 06:14:00	Worthing man running length of Africa eyes Sahara Desert - BBC News	A man running the length of Africa is eyeing the most difficult part of the challenge - crossing the Sahara Desert. Russell Cook, from Worthing, West Sussex, had originally planned to complete 360 marathons in 240 days.After complications with his visas, health scares, geopolitical issues and an armed robbery, the 26-year-old was forced to extend the challenge.On day 273, Mr Cook said he was "sizing up the Sahara" for the final leg of the mission. "We've got a difficult stretch to manoeuvre. One of those reasons is because the Sahara Desert is really big, famously has no water and is very hot," he said. "Another thing to add into that issue is that there are some quite difficult geopolitical issues to resolve in that region."We have to cross from Mauritania to Algeria on foot, which as far as we can see from research, hasn't been done by foreigners in a very long time."Mr Cook, nicknamed "Hardest Geezer", said he had attempted to contact tourism boards and government representatives in Algeria to "help smooth that situation over".The extreme challenge began at South Africa's most southerly point on 22 April and will finish at Tunisia's most northerly point.Mr Cook had originally aimed to cover 14,500km (9,320 miles) during the challenge, crossing 16 borders, but extended the challenge due to complications.Speaking from Senegal, Mr Cook said he did not expect any difficulties from the wildlife in the Sahara Desert. "Luckily for me, all the big ones seem to have heard rumours of a mad ginger man running through the continent, and they have just deserted at all costs," he added. The challenge is in aid of The Running Charity, having raised £131,898 so far. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram. Send your story ideas to southeasttoday@bbc.co.uk.	
21/01/2024 18:53:00	More than 25,000 now killed in Gaza since Israel offensive began, Hamas-run health ministry says - BBC News	More than 25,000 people have now been killed in Gaza during Israel's offensive there, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.It said there had been 178 deaths in the last 24 hours, making it one of the deadliest days in the war so far. As fighting continued, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again rejected creating a Palestinian state.The White House has said the US and Israel "clearly see things differently" when it comes to a two-state solution.Israel began its offensive following the 7 October attack in which Hamas fighters killed 1,300 people in southern Israel and took more than 240 hostage.In its first public account of the October assault, published on Sunday, Hamas described it as a "necessary step" against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and a way to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners.Israel's air and ground operation is currently focusing on southern Gaza, where the military are convinced top Hamas commanders are holed up in, or beneath, the city of Khan Younis. That is where the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had discovered another tunnel, some 830m (2,700ft) long and containing booby-traps and blast doors. The IDF footage showed what appeared to be a tunnel with mattresses and cells inside - it is where Israel believes around 20 hostages, including children, were held at various points. None were found when the tunnel was discovered, though.Israeli soldiers have also faced renewed attacks in the north of the Gaza Strip, where Hamas is said to have seized an opening around the town of Jabalia as Israel moved troops and tanks south.More than three months since the conflict erupted, Israel - whose army far outstrips Hamas's capabilities - is still facing significant resistance across Gaza. US intelligence agencies reportedly estimate that the Israeli military has killed 20-30% of Hamas fighters, which falls far short of Mr Netanyahu's stated aim of "completely destroying" the armed group.The classified report is also said to have found that Hamas still has enough munitions to continue striking Israel and Israeli forces for months, raising the spectre of a prolonged war in which Israel could get bogged down.The apparent slow progress, the fact no top Hamas commander has yet been captured or killed, and the collective trauma over the 130 or so Israeli hostages still missing, is prompting growing anti-government anger in Israel. Protests are continuing by relatives of those still held by Hamas, calling for Mr Netanyahu to prioritise their release over the potentially impossible aim of destroying Hamas. And a still relatively small anti-war movement is also demonstrating, horrified by the damage wrought on Gaza - one of the most intense and destructive military campaigns in recent history. Most Israelis have rallied around their flag - but not around their prime minister, who, according to a recent poll, only 15% of the public believe should stay in office once the war ends.How it does end is the subject of growing disagreement between Mr Netanyahu and Israel's western allies. After speaking to US President Joe Biden for the first time in almost a month, the Israeli prime minister reiterated his rejection of a future Palestinian state. In a post on X - formerly Twitter - he said Israel must retain "security control over the entire area west of [River] Jordan", which also encompasses the Israeli-occupied West Bank territory.Mr Netanyahu has been fiercely opposed to a Palestinian state throughout his political career. But by repeatedly asserting it now, an increasingly unpopular prime minister appears to be doubling down on a view that he feels chimes with the majority opinion in a nation too horrified by the attacks to countenance an independent Palestinian state.His apparent fight for political survival is clashing with exasperated Israeli allies, who hope that the current bloodshed could force both sides into meaningful diplomacy over a sustainable two-state solution.UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC earlier that Mr Netanyahu's stance was "disappointing". The White House has said the US and Israel "clearly see things differently".Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, went further, calling the refusal to accept a Palestinian state "completely unacceptable". He added it "would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security".	
21/01/2024 12:28:00	Shapps 'disappointed' by Netanyahu opposition to Palestinian state - BBC News	Creating two separate states is the only solution to ending the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, the defence secretary has said.Grant Shapps said it was "disappointing" that Israel's prime minister has rejected the idea. Benjamin Netanyahu's position was not "a surprise", he told the BBC.But Mr Shapps said Palestinians "deserved" a sovereign state, adding "I really don't see that there is another solution".Following a call with US President Joe Biden on Saturday, Mr Netanyahu's office released a statement saying he had "reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty". Mr Shapps said the comments were "very disappointing". "It's not in some senses a surprise - he's spent his entire political career against a two-state solution. But the point is, which other route is there to seriously resolve this?" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. "Palestinians deserve a sovereign state, Israel deserves to have the full ability to defend itself, its own security."Unless you pursue a two-state solution, I really don't see that there is another solution."He added there were a variety of views within the Israeli government "so we very much distinguish between the views of individuals and our overall support for Israel as a country". Labour has also described Mr Netanyahu's comments as "completely unacceptable". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told Sky News: "Statehood of a people is not in the gift of its neighbour, it is the right of a people and it is the right of the Palestinian people."Mr Netanyahu's remarks appeared to deepen a public divide with the US.  Speaking to reporters after the call between the two leaders, Mr Biden insisted a two-state solution was still possible with Mr Netanyahu in office."There are a number of types of two-state solutions. There's a number of countries that are members of the UN that... don't have their own militaries," he said.Hamas killed about 1,300 people and took 240 hostages in its surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October. In response, Israel launched airstrikes and a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip.  According to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, more than 25,000 people have been killed in the territory since the start of the conflict. Also appearing on the programme, Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf, whose parents-in-law were trapped in Gaza for more than three weeks in the early stages of the war, repeated his call for an immediate ceasefire. Asked if he thought people sometimes placed a different value on Palestinian lives, he said: "Without a shadow of a doubt. If you talk to anybody who is Palestinian, you speak to many people in the Muslim community, they feel that the Palestinian blood is very cheap."In his interview, Mr Shapps also said the UK needed to be prepared for "a more dangerous world".In a speech on Monday he warned of growing risks posed by countries including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, as well as terrorist groups. However, asked when the government would hit its target of spending 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the size of the economy, on defence, Mr Shapps said he could not give an exact date. He told the BBC the trajectory was "already upwards", with spending "comfortably above 2%", and that the target would be met "when economic conditions allow". It comes after former head of the British Army Gen Lord Dannatt warned the UK risked a repeat of the 1930s, when the "woeful state" of its armed forces failed to deter Hitler, unless it invested more in its military.  Writing in the Times on Friday, he criticised the shrinking size of the Army and called for the government to commit to spending 3% of GDP on defence.Challenged over why the size of the Army was reducing if the threats to the UK were growing, Mr Shapps said: "It's not the number of people alone that matters, it's the lethality, it's how capable our systems are of defence."	
21/01/2024 10:32:00	Understanding a week of missile strikes across Middle East - BBC News	The past week has seen new rounds of violence across the Middle East, deepening fears of conflict spreading in an already unstable region.Here is a brief guide to what has happened - and where it might lead.On Tuesday, Iran unexpectedly carried out a missile and drone attack on Pakistani territory. Iran said it was targeting an Iranian Sunni Muslim militant group, Jaish al-Adl, that has staged attacks inside Iran. Pakistan said two children were killed and swiftly hit back, launching missiles at Pakistani "terrorist hideouts" on Iran's side of the border. Iran said three women, two men and four children were killed.The flare-up has heightened tensions in a region already experiencing a multitude of crises. Although the area of the tit-for-tat strikes is far from the main theatres of fighting in the Middle East, the border is volatile and further incidents here could quickly escalate, for instance if Jaish al-Adl retaliates against Iran.This week saw multiple rounds of US Navy missile strikes against the Houthi Zaidi Shia movement in Yemen, following Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a waterway crucial to world trade. The Houthis - backed by Iran - stepped up their attacks in November following the outbreak of the war in Gaza. They vowed to target "Israeli-linked" boats so long as Israel's offensive continued, to show solidarity with the Palestinians.Consequently all merchant shipping in the international waters has been put under threat, something considered intolerable by Western powers. The US and UK, backed by allies, launched the first air strikes against the Houthis last week to try to deter them - but the group has remained defiant.On Monday, the Houthis hit a US vessel in the Gulf of Aden in what appeared to be their first successful attack on an American ship since their campaign began. A second was hit in the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday and the Houthis have vowed to continue - raising the prospect of further US strikes and the question of whether Iran will feel forced to respond.An increasingly intensifying years-long shadow war between arch-foes Israel and Iran ratcheted up on Monday when Iran fired missiles at what it described as headquarters of Israel's Mossad spy agency in Irbil in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, killing four people. Iraq - an ally of Iran and hostile to Israel - denied Mossad was there and condemned the attack.Iran said its attack was a response to the alleged Israeli killings recently of a senior Iranian commander in Syria and two top Iran-backed militants in Lebanon - one a commander of the Shia militant movement Hezbollah and the other the deputy leader of the Palestinian group Hamas.The Israel-Lebanese border, where Israel and Hezbollah - heavily armed and funded by Iran - have frequently traded strikes since the Hamas attack on Israel and start of the Gaza war on 7 October, is one of the most dangerous fronts in the region.On Wednesday Israel's military chief of staff said "the likelihood of [war in the north] happening in the coming months is much higher than it was in the past."At the same time as it struck in Iraq, Iran fired missiles into a rebel-held province in north-west Syria, saying it had targeted bases of the Islamic State (IS) group in retaliation for IS suicide bombings in southern Iran on 3 January which killed 94 people. IS, a Sunni jihadist group, considers Shia Muslims heretical, and Iran is the dominant Shia power in the region. While Iran is a key ally of the Syrian government, directly striking militants in the rebel-held region is a rare step and a signal to its adversaries that Iran is prepared to act far afield.An air strike on the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Saturday killed 10 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Five of them were senior members of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Syria and Iran blamed Israel, with Iran vowing revenge. It follows similar strikes around Damascus earlier in the week. Israel has not commented, but has previously acknowledged carrying out hundreds of aerial operations in Syria involving attacks on targets it says are linked to Iran. An interception of a fighter aircraft by Syrian air defences - which has so far not happened - or deadly retaliation could ignite a new crisis in a region beset by wars.Intense fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has continued, with the war there now in its 15th week. At least 891 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombardment since last Sunday, raising the death toll there since 7 October to more than 25,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. On the Israeli side, nine soldiers were killed in the same period, bringing its combat death total to 189.Israel intensified its offensive on the southern city of Khan Younis this week, while troops reached their furthest point south since the start of the war, the Israeli military said. Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the conflict could go on until 2025, Israeli TV reported this week.Israel was also hit by a car-ramming and stabbing attack on Monday, for which police arrested two Palestinian suspects from the occupied West Bank. The attack, which was praised by Hamas, killed a woman and injured 17 other people. It was one of the first such attacks inside Israel since the start of the Gaza war, heightening anxieties among Israelis still reeling from the 7 October attacks. Violence has also escalated in the West Bank alongside the war. Israeli air strikes there on Wednesday killed nine Palestinians, medics said. Israel said at least five of the dead were planning an imminent attack.Missiles were fired at an air base used by US-led coalition forces in western Iraq on Saturday, injuring several US military personnel, US Central Command said. Iranian-backed militants are suspected of being behind the attack. Bases housing US and coalition forces in Iraq and north-east Syria have been attacked dozens of times by Iranian-backed militants in recent months, drawing US retaliation. The attacks are seen as part of Iran's indirect conflict with the US, where it can strike US assets at arms length.About 3,400 coalition personnel are in Iraq and Syria as part of efforts to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group, which still operates in pockets in the region.Attacks by one country into another have also been happening in other places in the Middle East this week.Turkey carried out air strikes against Kurdish militants in northern Iraq and a US-backed Kurdish-led militia alliance in northern Syria on Monday, its defence ministry said. The latest strikes are part of a decades-long and bloody conflict between Turkey and armed Kurdish groups which Turkey, which has a large Kurdish minority, regards as terrorist organisations. One of the strikes is reported to have hit a prison holding more than 3,000 IS prisoners.There were also rare air strikes by Jordan across its border with Syria. Ten people, including children, are reported to have been killed. It is thought to have targeted drug smugglers. Iran-backed militias in Syria have been accused by Jordan of trafficking the amphetamine Captagon into the kingdom and on to Gulf Arab states.	
21/01/2024 09:08:00	Israel-Gaza: Netanyahu defies Biden over Palestinian state - BBC News	Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again rejected the idea of creating a Palestinian state.His comments came hours after a phone call with US President Joe Biden after which the US leader indicated Mr Netanyahu may still accept the idea. Mr Netanyahu's remarks appeared to deepen a public divide with the US.The US believes a Palestinian state alongside Israel - known as a "two-state solution" - is vital for long-term stability. But the White House acknowledged this week the US and Israeli governments "clearly see things differently".Speaking to reporters after the two leaders held a call for the first time in almost a month, Mr Biden insisted a two-state solution was still possible with Mr Netanyahu in office."There are a number of types of two-state solutions. There's a number of countries that are members of the UN that... don't have their own militaries," he said.But on Saturday Mr Netanyahu doubled down on his position, which he has held for much of his political career and repeated earlier this week.A statement released by his office read: "In his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty."Also on Saturday, in a post on X - formerly Twitter - he said Israel must retain "security control over the entire area west of [River] Jordan", an area which also encompasses the Israeli-occupied West Bank territory. UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said on Sunday that Mr Netanyahu's statement was "disappointing", even though it was not a surprise.The comments will dampen hopes in some circles that the Gaza crisis could result in Israeli and Palestinian leaders restarting diplomatic negotiations and kickstarting the dormant peace process.Mr Netanyahu's increasing isolation abroad comes amid continuing support for the war at home, coupled with protests over the fate of the estimated 130 hostages still being held inside Gaza by Hamas.Hamas killed about 1,300 people - mostly civilians - and took 240 hostages in their surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October.Thousands of protesters, including relatives of those still missing, gathered in Tel Aviv on Saturday, urging Mr Netanyahu to reach a truce to allow the hostages home. Gil Dickmann, whose cousin was captured on 7 October, said: "Dear Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, we believe that you can bring them back. We believe in you. "We know that you can sign this deal and bring about this victory to all the citizens of Israel. Just do it, Bibi. Just do it. Bring the hostages back home."Israeli forces have continued to push into southern Gaza, saying they are searching for top Hamas officials they believe are hiding in Khan Younis, the Strip's second biggest city.The Israel Defense Forces said they had raided a tunnel in Khan Younis that had been used to hold hostages, although they were not there when it was discovered. While the focus of the fighting is now in southern Gaza, there have been renewed clashes around the northern town of Jabalia, as Palestinian fighters reportedly advanced while Israel tried to move its soldiers and tanks south. Almost three months since Israel launched its ground invasion of Gaza, its army - vastly superior to Hamas in strength and equipment - is still facing significant resistance across the territory. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said on Sunday that 25,105 people had been killed in the territory since 7 October. More than 60,000 had also been injured, it said. 	
21/01/2024 07:28:00	Jerusalem: Armenian Christians fight controversial land deal - BBC News	While Christmas may be a distant memory for many, the Armenians of Jerusalem only just held their annual celebration on 19 January. This year, the holiday was overshadowed by the war in Gaza and the ongoing threat to the survival of the community from a deeply controversial real estate deal.Many spent the day in an unconventional fashion, joining a sit-in at a tent in their church car park, which is part of a large plot at risk in the Armenian Quarter of the walled Old City."This illegal, treacherous land deal actually brought us all together," says Setrag Balian, a ceramicist turned activist.  Armenians date their presence in the holy city back to the 4th Century. Many of the 2,000-strong community live inside the large, cobble-stoned compound of St James Convent.In the past, they have often been divided by political differences and family fights and there have been rifts between Jerusalemite Armenians and their Church leaders who act as employers and landlords for many.  Yet for two months, local Armenians and priests have all been staying in a large, improvised tent here, around-the-clock, to try to block the development going ahead. They eat here and work shifts as guards behind a makeshift barricade decorated with Armenian flags.Together, they say, they have seen off attacks by contractors with bulldozers, armed settlers and masked thugs."Everything was put in danger with this deal," Setrag says. "Whoever wants to take away our rights and endanger our presence and our lives here, we will stand up against them and defend our rights till the end."Last April, facts began to emerge about a 2021 contract secretly signed between the Armenian Patriarch and a Jewish Australian-Israeli developer. It gave a newly-created firm, Xana Gardens, a 98-year lease to build and operate a luxury hotel in an area known as the Cow's Garden.The deal covered a plot of 11,500 sq m, abutting the ramparts of the south-western corner of the Old City, with an option to take over an even bigger area.  It includes the car park, some church buildings and the homes of five Armenian families, accounting for about 25% of the Armenian Quarter.Located on Mount Zion, it has huge religious significance and is incredibly valuable real estate but an annual fee of just $300,000 (£237,000) was to be paid by the developer."For that amount you could barely rent yourself a couple of falafel shops in the Old City," commented one Armenian using the car park, who asked for his name not to be used. Amid heated protests by locals and a decision by Jordan and the Palestinian Authority to withdraw their recognition of the patriarch over his role in the deal, pressure grew on the Church to cancel the contract.Meanwhile, an international team of Armenian lawyers came to investigate and give advice.  The patriarch claimed he had been tricked by a trusted priest who was later defrocked.  He finally announced a formal move to cancel the deal in October.At that point, tensions between Armenians and representatives of the developer - whose workers had forcibly taken over the car park - began turning into direct confrontations.When Israeli bulldozers arrived at the contested site to try to begin demolition, Armenians rushed to block it. The next month, there were claims of intimidation as the developer arrived with several armed men.  Further attempted incursions came after the protest tent was set up. The most violent was last month when masked men came to the car park beating people with sticks and using tear gas. A priest, Father Diran Hagopian, broadcast events on Facebook Live."They were shouting, 'you should go out from this land'," he later told the BBC. "One of their leaders was shouting: 'You can break their legs, you can even kill them, but they should leave.'"The apparent involvement of known Jewish settlers in attacks alongside other evidence has increased long-held suspicions that a powerful settler organisation is involved in the attempted land takeover.  Ever since Israel captured the Old City and its holy sites from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War, Jewish investors in Israel and overseas have sought to buy properties to try to cement Israeli control over occupied East Jerusalem.Palestinians want this part of the city as the capital of their hoped-for future state. Jewish Israelis view the whole of the city as their eternal, undivided capital.Researchers at the Israeli non-profit organisation Ir Amim, which is focused on the Israel-Palestinian conflict and supports the diversity of Jerusalem, are worried about developments in the Armenian Quarter."This is close to sensitive places," says Aviv Tatarksy. "Creating a settlement in this area is part of very far-reaching aims of settler organisations who basically want to Judaise completely the Old City, with their eyes on the Temple Mount or al-Aqsa Mosque."The settlements built in occupied territory are seen as illegal under international law, although Israel disagrees.The BBC has contacted the developer behind Xana Gardens several times but not heard back.  The now-defrocked American priest who coordinated the deal, Baret Yeretsian , was surrounded by a mob of angry young Armenians shouting "traitor" as he exited St James Convent last year, assisted by Israeli police, before moving to Southern California.He has since denied to journalists that the developer has any political or ideological agenda, describing such accusations as "propaganda" based on his Jewish identity.The Armenian Church has now begun proceedings through the Israeli courts to challenge the validity of the contract for the Cows' Garden.  As locals gathered around a brightly lit Christmas tree in their makeshift tent last week, they remained resolute but were aware that their legal fight could easily take years.Whether incursions can be stopped in the meantime remains to be seen.	
21/01/2024 00:44:00	US personnel injured in missile attack on Al Asad airbase in Iraq - BBC News	A number of US military personnel have been injured in a missile attack on an airbase in western Iraq.The US military's Central Command said an Iran-backed militia targeted the Al Asad airbase, which hosts American troops, with ballistic missiles and rockets on Saturday evening. An unspecified number of US personnel were "undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain injuries".At least one Iraqi service member was wounded in the attack.The strike against the base was claimed by a group calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. According to the US-based Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the group emerged in late 2023 and is comprised of several Iran-affiliated armed groups operating in Iraq.It has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks. And Al Asad base has been attacked repeatedly in recent years.The US military said most of the missiles fired on Saturday were intercepted but some evaded air defences and hit the base, adding that an assessment of the damage is ongoing.It is the latest in a series of attacks on US positions in Iraq and Syria by Iran's proxies in the region since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza conflict last October.The US military and allies have also intervened to stop Houthi missile attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea.US forces carried out another airstrike on Saturday against the Houthis - an Iran-backed rebel group controlling much of western Yemen. The US military said it targeted a launch site, after identifying an anti-ship missile "that was aimed into the Gulf of Aden and prepared to launch".The Iranian military has carried out a number of missile strikes in recent days against targets in Syria, Iraq and Pakistan.Earlier on Saturday, Iran accused Israel of carrying out an airstrike in the Syrian capital Damascus which killed five senior members of Iran's security forces.	
20/01/2024 20:20:00	Iran warns air strike on Syria will not go unanswered - BBC News	Iran's president said an air strike on the Syrian capital that killed five senior members of Iran's security forces will not "go unanswered".Ebrahim Raisi said Israel was to blame for the attack, which also killed a number of Syrian forces. Israel has not commented. For years it has carried out strikes on Iranian-linked targets in Syria.Such strikes have intensified since the Israel-Gaza war began following Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israel. In a statement posted on the president's officials website, Mr Raisi expressed his condolences to the families of the "high-ranking martyrs".He vowed to avenge their deaths, and described the attack as a "cowardly assassination of five of Iran's most distinguished advisors".The statement described the strike as "terrorist and criminal" and said it "shows the height of [Israel's] desperation and weakness against the combatants of the resistance front". "It will not remain unanswered," said the statement.Iran's foreign ministry said the attacks were an "aggressive and provocative" act by Israel, urging international actors to condemn them. Senior figures among the Iranian Revolutionary Guard - a major military, political and economic force in Iran - have been present in Syria since the civil war began there in 2011, helping to support the regime of President Bashar al-Assad against widespread rebellion to his rule.Saturday's attack took place in the Mazzeh neighbourhood, south-west Damascus, an area home to a military airport, as well as the UN headquarters in Damascus, embassies and restaurants. Iran's semi-official Mehr news agency said the attacks killed the IRGC's Syria intelligence chief and his deputy, as well as other Guard members. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based campaign group, said 10 people were killed in the strikes, including leaders of the Revolutionary Guard.The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency quoted a military source as saying it had managed to stop some of the missiles, but that the attacks - which it said had hit a residential building - killed and injured some civilians. Buildings were also destroyed, it said. A resident told AFP news agency that they saw "explosions" in the western Mazzeh area and "a large cloud of smoke". "The sound was similar to a missile explosion, and minutes later I heard the sound of ambulances," he added. Videos, which the BBC has not verified, showed a large cloud of smoke and buildings destroyed.Last month a suspected Israeli air strike just outside Damascus killed a senior IRGC commander.The Middle East has been on heightened alert since 7 October, when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel, killing about 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking 240 hostages back to Gaza. More than 132 hostages are thought to still be held in the territory. More than 24,900 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel says its ground and air operation in Gaza is aimed at destroying Hamas. The conflict has raised concerns about a wider war spreading around the region, particularly between fierce rivals Israel and Iran, and amid a series of overlapping crises. Israel is targeting the Palestinian group Hamas, which is supported by Tehran. It has been carrying out precision strikes across the border in Syria for some time now, bombing weapons supplies heading for its Iran-backed foe, Hezbollah, or taking out key figures in that supply chain, and it is also exchanging fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria are also targeting US forces in the region, and the US and UK have struck the Houthis - another Iran-backed group - in Yemen, who have been attacking ships in the Red Sea. Fears about an even wider conflict were further heightened this week, when Iran exchanged strikes with its neighbour Pakistan. On Tuesday, Iran admitted carrying out a missile and drone attack in south-western Pakistan, killing two children, saying it was targeting an "Iranian terrorist group" in Pakistan. Days later, Islamabad hit back, launching strikes it said were targeting "terrorist hideouts" in south-eastern Iran, killing nine people. Although both sides insisted they were targeting militant bases in each other's countries, Iran and Pakistan withdrew their ambassadors from the respective capitals. But following talks, diplomatic ties were restored. Iran has hit targets in Pakistan, Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan, Turkey has also bombed Kurdistan, while Jordan has attacked drug smugglers across its border with Syria. The US is still hitting ISIS in Syria and simultaneously fighting off drone strikes by Iran's proxies there and in Iraq. There is no common policy behind these attacks, other than the well-worn pretext of "acting in national self defence". 	
20/01/2024 14:17:00	Two Royal Navy warships collide off coast of Bahrain - BBC News	An investigation is under way after two UK warships collided at a port in Bahrain, the Royal Navy says.Video widely shared on social media appeared to show HMS Chiddingfold reverse into HMS Bangor off the coast in the Middle Eastern port.No-one was hurt in the incident, the Ministry of Defence said, declining to comment on the nature of the collision while investigations continue.The two ships are part of the UK's long-standing presence in the Gulf.Both are specialist minesweeper vessels, helping ensure the safe flow of trade through the waters, the Royal Navy said."We are aware of an incident concerning two minehunters alongside in Bahrain. There are no casualties as a result of this incident and it would be inappropriate to comment further whilst investigations are ongoing," a spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence told the BBC.Meanwhile, Rear Admiral Edward Ahlgren said the cause of the collision "is still to be established". "We train our people to the highest standards and rigorously enforce machinery safety standards, but unfortunately incidents of this nature can still happen," he told PA news agency.A full and thorough investigation "is already under way," Rear Adm Ahlgren said, "and any changes in procedure that could prevent further incidents will be rapidly implemented.""In the meantime, the UK will continue to play a key part in ensuring the safety of merchant shipping in the region."Footage unverified by the BBC showed what seemed to be a large hole in the fibreglass hull of HMS Bangor following the crash.It is not the first time HMS Chiddingfold has been involved in such an incident. In 2021, also off the coast of Bahrain, it struck HMS Penzance, a ship of the same class as HMS Bangor.HMS Bangor is due to be decommissioned next year.	
20/01/2024 07:21:00	Palestinians tell of fears for the future as war destroys Gaza - BBC News	As Israel intensifies its offensive on Khan Younis, Palestinians in Gaza have spoken of their fears for the future.Some of the heaviest battles in Gaza in recent days have been around the southern city.Already displaced families have been fleeing the area of the Nasser hospital, the largest still functioning in the territory.More than 24,900 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its response to the 7 October Hamas attacks, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Hamas attack in Israel killed around 1,300 people, most of them civilians, and saw 240 hostages taken back to Gaza. Israel says its air and ground operation in Gaza is aimed at destroying Hamas.The majority of Gaza's 2.3 million people are displaced and fight daily to find food, drink and medicine. Mohammed al-Khaldi, a father of two children displaced from Gaza City, told the BBC: "I lost my home, my shop and my source of income. I am no longer able to provide the simplest requirements of life for my children. "I hold the Israeli occupation responsible for the massive destruction, but I do not absolve Hamas of responsibility for everything that happened," he said.Hamas is the Palestinian group which has run Gaza since 2007. Its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, was thought to have about 30,000 members before the 7 October attack."The worst thing that could happen is that we return to the previous situation, to a war every two or three years. The situation was difficult before the war and has become catastrophic now," Mr Khaldi said. "The prices of goods have risen tenfold and most basic necessities are not available. I wish to die a thousand times every day when I look into my children's eyes and feel terrible helplessness because I am not able to feed them."Most of the people I spoke to in Khan Younis said that the Israeli army was advancing towards the city centre. They are working underground more than above ground, said Naji Mahmoud, one of the displaced people from Gaza City. Mr Mahmoud witnessed a major Israeli attack that took place in northern Gaza and left for Khan Younis during the week-long humanitarian truce at the end of November. "We feel that the ground is shaking under us, something like an earthquake, and this is repeated almost every evening, the bombings seem to target the tunnels," he told the BBC. "When we were in Gaza [City], most of the attacks were from the air." Manifestations of security breakdown are spreading throughout Gaza, and people are complaining about the phenomenon of theft and armed robbery. A journalist who requested anonymity told the BBC: "I was returning from my job in Rafah late at night. I had three masked people stop me - they were carrying knives, and one of them was carrying a gun. "They searched the car for anything valuable. One of them noticed that I was a journalist and allowed me to leave." On the streets of Rafah masked police officers with guns in police cars can be seen, but people are complaining that they are not doing enough to deter merchants who monopolise goods and raise prices in an insane manner. "I bought a bag of wheat marked Unrwa [the UN agency for Palestinian refugees] for $100 (£79; €92) - 10 times the original price. Why are the police not arresting the war traders who sell wheat most likely stolen from the UN aid agencies?" complained Mohammed Sheik Khalil. "I can't find milk for my baby, my son has autism and has not received treatment for months. I cannot calm him down, and his condition has deteriorated after we made great strides in treating him before the war."Hamas always worked according to emergency plans during the previous four wars, but this time it is different. The Israeli army has destroyed the government system, killed a large number of security and police officers, and destroyed security headquarters and police stations, leaving ordinary crime uncontrolled.Neveen Imadedin, a mother displaced from her home in Gaza City and now living in the southern town of Rafah, said: "We want the war to end but with a sustained long-term political solution. We want our state, not to return to the no-peace, no-war situation. "Look what happened to us, thieves stole everything from my house, my clothes, home furniture and even solar panels." "My house is located in the western part of Gaza City and was hit by four shells from the Israeli tanks that were controlling the neighbourhood. "We are displaced here in Rafah and before that [we were] in Khan Younis. We have no money and no home, the unstoppable wars between Hamas and Israel have destroyed our lives."A businessman called Mohammed agreed. "We have lived under unjust rule for more than 16 years. Hamas imposed heavy taxes on us and now they have dragged us into a devastating war in which we lost our property, money and homes," he told the BBC. "I used to live in a good house and work in trade. Now what will we do? The crossings are closed, the company has been destroyed, and the house is not fit for habitation due to the destruction."The worst thing that could happen to us is that we return under Hamas rule when the war ends."	
20/01/2024 01:12:00	Tracking Houthi attacks in the Red Sea - BBC News	In recent weeks the dangers for shipping in the Red Sea region have increased dramatically, as Iranian-backed Houthi fighters have targeted commercial shipping with drone and missile attacks, as well as more brazen assaults by boat and helicopter.The Houthis, who control a large part of Yemen, have declared their support for their "Palestinian brothers in Gaza and the West Bank" and say they are targeting commercial vessels with links to Israel.But many of the ships targeted, particularly in recent days, have no clear links to Israel at all.  As can be seen in data mapped by BBC Verify below, most of the attempted strikes on shipping have occurred at the southern end of the Red Sea, along the Yemeni coast, as the waterway narrows into the Bab al-Mandab Strait.Shipping further east in the Gulf of Aden has also been targeted. Only a few of the attempted strikes have hit their targets. One of the most recent was on 17 January, involving the Genco Picardy, a US-owned bulk carrier. It sustained damage to its side from a Houthi drone but was able to continue its journey.On the scene shortly afterwards to take this photograph was an Indian navy warship - an indication of the multi-national scale of efforts to repel Houthi attacks. Houthi forces have used a range of weaponry, including missiles and kamikaze attack drones.They possess Qasef-1 and Qasef-2 drones with an estimated range of 200km, and others with a flying range of up to 1,800km. Their ground-launched missiles may be capable of striking ships up to 800km away.The Houthis have also tried boarding ships using small boats, and on one occasion, used a helicopter to land an assault team on the deck of a cargo ship, the Galaxy Leader. The group hijacked the vessel and it is still being held off the Yemeni coast.Some weaponry being used in these attacks has been plundered from the country's military since the start of Yemen's civil war. The UN also says components for Houthi weaponry have been sourced from east Asia through civilian supply chains. But the increasingly sophisticated array of drones and missiles used by Houthi forces has increased speculation that Iran is supplying them with weapons as well.The US has announced the seizure of what it says are parts for missiles and air defence systems on a fishing boat travelling from Iran to Yemen. Military analysts also believe an Iranian ship, the MV Behshad, is helping the Houthis target vessels in the region. The MV Behshad was originally in service as a cargo ship which analysts say has now been retrofitted with surveillance equipment.The BBC has approached the Iranian government for comment.Lightly-armed private guards that travel with many of the commercial ships are not equipped to fend off attacks from the air, says Chris Farrell, who has led on-board security teams in the region. "It's one of the biggest challenges commercial shipping has faced in a very long time," he says.As the international response has ramped up, the US and UK have carried out air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen in an attempt to degrade their military capability.However, the Houthis control extensive areas of mountainous terrain in Yemen, and military experts say this makes it easier to hide their radar platforms, munitions and launch vehicles. In December, a US-led military partnership was announced to safeguard commercial shipping in the area with warships patrolling the waters of the Red Sea. The UK has committed naval vessels to the operation. Other countries, including France, have military vessels in the area as well, but outside the US-led operation.Coordinating the efforts of several international partnerships will be a challenge, says Bradley Martin, a former US Navy captain, now at the Rand Corporation. Keeping these vessels fuelled and re-supplied with sophisticated weaponry is very expensive, he says. An intercept missile such as the Sea Viper can cost over a million dollars whereas a Houthi attack drone may only cost a few thousand dollars to produce. A growing number of companies are redirecting their ships away from the Red Sea, choosing a much longer, more costly journey around Africa's Cape of Good Hope.Those operators choosing to risk the dangers of the Red Sea route have adopted other measures to reduce the possibility of attack. Some have disabled their on-board AIS tracking - the system all commercial shipping uses to allow their position and declared route to be monitored - making it harder for Houthi forces to locate them. Some ships have taken to declaring "no link to Israel" on their location equipment. Others have written "armed guards on board" or "all Chinese crew" - underscoring what ship owners believe will deter attackers.Despite recent US and UK airstrikes, the Houthis "retain considerable ability" to target shipping, says Dr Martin, but as their missile stockpiles deplete, we may see an uptick in attacks by drones and boats. "The risk to shipping can be brought down," he says, but ultimately the key is resolving broader political issues like the Israel-Gaza conflict. "We're not going to end it just with defending shipping."	
20/01/2024 00:43:00	Iran's sudden strikes show just how perilous region has become - BBC News	These are shape-shifting times in the Middle East. This week, out of the blue, Iran suddenly attacked targets in "friendly" Pakistan, sparking an unprecedented tit-for-tat across their volatile border and a sharp spike in tension on a far edge of the grievous Israel-Gaza war.Iran wanted a message to be heard loud and clear - at home, and a long way beyond. "It has showcased its missile arsenal and its willingness to use it," says Vali Nasr, professor of international affairs and Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University. "It was a message also likely intended for Israel and the US in the midst of the Gaza war, especially with the potential escalation in Lebanon and Yemen."Like most observers, he believes "for now Iran is not looking to escalate".  Ever since the Gaza war exploded after Hamas's murderous 7 October assault on southern Israel, it has been darkened by fears of an even more dangerous contagion. No-one, including Iran and its principal partner Hezbollah, as well as the United States, wants to see an even hotter conflagration. Iran's war has been a web of shadow wars. It sits at the fulcrum of what it calls an "axis of resistance", the alliance of Tehran-backed groups dotting the region, from Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, to the Houthis in Yemen, and well-armed groups in both Iraq and Syria. Most have been designated as terrorist entities by some Western states.Their military prowess is rooted in Iran's accelerated arming and training; each actor also has agendas and ambitions of its own. Fires have been burning on all these fronts, and sometimes blazing, with efforts to douse the flames lest they provoke crippling Israeli and American reprisals.When Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) carried out these first direct strikes since this crisis erupted, they trained their sights on Pakistan and two other friendly countries. They may have seen them as areas of least resistance beyond the highly combustible landscape of their "axis of resistance". Iran's elite force unleashed a barrage of ballistic missiles and suicide drones against what it called an intelligence centre for Israel's Mossad spy agency in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, and at "anti-Iran terror groups" including Islamic State in rebel-controlled swathes of Syria.Each operation was said to have its own specific retaliatory rationale.Iran says it had to aim fire at Iranian Baloch separatists operating in restive southwest Pakistan. "An attack was imminent. They had gathered and were leaving the base," says Prof Seyed Mohammad Marandi at the University of Tehran. He also points to last month's killing of 11 Iranian police officers in its tense province of Sistan and Balochistan.Pakistan also spoke of an "impending attack" when it then fired its own salvos two days later into southern Iran against what it said were bases of its own Baloch nationalists, which it called "terrorist targets". This cross-border tension has simmered for decades; this is its worst moment.Northern Iraq and Syria, closer to the Gaza epicentre, were about settling separate scores."The attacks in Iraq and Syria were retaliation for the general as well as the atrocity in Kerman," explains Prof Marandi. He's referring to last month's assassination just outside Damascus of one of the IRGC's most senior men, Sayyed Razi Mousavi, which was widely reported as the work of an Israeli air strike. Then, earlier this month, a double suicide bombing shattered a memorial service in Iran for Qasem Soleimani, the top commander assassinated by an American drone in Iraq four years ago. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the deadliest attack in Iran since the 1979 revolution."Iran has been under pressure to react, including to the killing of senior Hamas and Hezbollah commanders in Lebanon, but it doesn't want to get directly embroiled in any escalation by hitting Israel or the US," says Mohammad Ali Shabani, editor of Amwaj media, which provides in-depth analyses of the region."We are going to continue to see a slow boil," he says. These are also tough times at home for Iran's ruling clerics. They've faced unprecedented women-led protests over social freedoms and more, as well as financial woes stemming from international sanctions, alleged corruption, and mismanagement.And there has been blowback after these latest operations, with angry denunciations from Iraq, as well as the Arab League, and an even more forceful rebuke from Pakistan."They did not think through that striking in Pakistan territory could just have no repercussions," remarks former Pakistan foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar. "Their action created a crater of distrust. It will take hard work and persistence to fill." There are wars within wars in every corner of this conflict. Pakistan also had to be seen to be setting its own red lines in a neighbourhood where age-old rival India, as well as Taliban-run Afghanistan, were watching closely. Accusations and more of harbouring hostile forces have long been hurled across those borders too.This past week has been a reminder, if one was needed, of the unpredictability and peril in this moment of a widening and worsening Israel-Gaza war.Any day can be a flare-up on one or multiple fronts - and there are the longer-term risks being shaped in a region where fault lines were deeply and darkly etched long before Hamas's 7 October attacks. Israel's largest loss of life in a single day since the founding of its state, as well as the seizing of more than 250 hostages, sparked a military campaign causing a staggering number of civilian deaths and turning much of Gaza into an unliveable wasteland.It has enraged and emboldened this Iran-backed military alliance of militant non-state actors. They've been drawing closer for years. Now they've forged a far more vocal and visible league.For Iran's adversaries, the proverbial "we need to do something about Iran" may now be even riskier. It may also mean confronting Tehran's staunchest allies across the region."Tehran has achieved what the Pentagon calls military 'overmatch' - a level of capability in which a country has weaponry that makes it extremely difficult to check or defeat," says Robin Wright, author of several books on Iran and a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars.This current escalation has not been cost-free. US salvos against Iranian-backed fighters in Iraq are reported to have significantly damaged their infrastructure. The Pentagon says its air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, in an effort to stop their attacks on vessels in the vital Red Sea shipping lanes, have destroyed a quarter of the Houthi arsenal.But on the balance sheets of some of Iran's allies, they believe they're winning far more than they're losing. Standing up for Gazans has galvanised their popularity on Arab streets. Yemen's Houthis in particular are relishing being catapulted into the centre of world attention.Minds are already focused on the "day after", when this Israel-Gaza war ends, including in Tehran, which has long prided itself on its "strategic patience"."Iran is playing a broader longer game," points out Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House. "It perhaps anticipates that after Gaza winds down Israel is going to be more provocative towards Iran, so it is preparing for a longer fight."Iran's long-term goals include keeping the US out of its backyard, and avoiding a direct confrontation with Israel and America.That means careful calculations on where and how it strikes in a hazardous region where the risks of miscalculation are always dangerously high.	
19/01/2024 23:17:00	Eisenkot: Key Israeli war leader challenges Netanyahu over Gaza strategy - BBC News	A key member of Israel's war cabinet has accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of not telling the truth about the military goals in Gaza.Mr Netanyahu has publicly rejected the US push for a future Palestinian state and insisted the offensive would continue "until complete victory".But Gadi Eisenkot said those advocating "absolute defeat" of Hamas were not "speaking the truth".The retired general's son was killed fighting in Gaza.In an interview to Israel Ch-12 Uvda, he also said Mr Netanyahu shared "sharp and clear responsibility" for failing to protect his country on 7 October and urged fresh elections, saying there was "no trust" in Israel's current leadership.Hamas killed about 1,300 people and took 240 hostages in their surprise attack on southern Israel.Almost 25,000 people have been killed by Israeli air strikes in Gaza since, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Tensions among the cabinet, with reports that the prime minister and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant are barely on speaking terms, come as the chasm between Israel and its Western allies widens. After Mr Netanyahu's comments on Palestinian statehood, the White House national security adviser John Kirby said the United States and Israel "clearly see things differently". A State Department spokesman said that there was no way to solve Israel's security challenges without a Palestinian state.The White House said President Joe Biden discussed a two-state solution with Mr Netanyahu during a call on Friday - the first in nearly a month. Later Mr Biden spoke to reporters in Washington and when asked by one if a two-state solution was impossible with Mr Netanyahu in office, he replied: "No, it's not"."There are a number of types of two-state solutions. There's a number of countries that are members of the UN that... don't have their own militaries," Mr Biden said.But Mr Netanyahu has spent his career resisting a Palestinian state and just last month boasted that he was proud to have prevented it.The timing of yet another rebuttal of the Biden Administration will heighten a sense of his growing international isolation.The US has repeatedly tried to influence Israel's military strategy during this conflict - urging more precision-guided attacks in Gaza as opposed to the blanket air strikes; delaying or abandoning the ground invasion; and engaging in meaningful talks on a two-state solution in which Israel would neighbour a future Palestinian state, with a role for the Palestinian Authority. But the calls have often been rejected by Mr Netanyahu during tense meetings with US officials, deepening the frustration in some American circles over President Biden's unconditional support for Israel. Amid the preponderance of death in this conflict, Israel's allies hope life could be breathed back into the dormant two-state plan as the only way to create lasting peace. But Mr Netanyahu's comments appear to show he wants quite the opposite: a position he undoubtedly hopes would be more in line with a future administration of Donald Trump and which could have been timed to give his old American friend red meat to rally his pro-Israel supporters in a US election year.Within Israel, an increasingly unpopular prime minister is falling back on the far-right that props up his government. A recent poll found that just 15% of Israelis want him to keep his job after the war. And while most Israelis continue to support military action against Hamas, the majority now say they want to prioritise bringing the remaining 130 or so hostages home, over the potentially impossible aim of destroying Hamas. His latest comments on a future Palestinian state are also a repudiation of Arab attempts to mediate in the conflict. Saudi Arabia has dangled before him the prize of normalising ties with Israel as part of a ceasefire deal that includes a two-state solution. But Israel's prime minister seems to have staked his political survival on a hard-line anti-Palestinian position.No longer can he sell himself as "Mr Security" after the worst attacks in Israel's history happening under his watch. Now it's "Mr No Independent Palestine": a position he believes will chime with the public mood here that, while increasingly out of love with its prime minister, is still too traumatised to conceive of a Palestinian state next door.	
19/01/2024 22:46:00	Trudeau balancing act on Israel-Gaza annoys both sides of debate - BBC News	Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has tried to walk a fine line on the Israel-Gaza conflict. But by seeking to appeal to all sides, he has pleased no-one.On Thursday, Israel's envoy to Canada had a request for Mr Trudeau - that Canada "leave no room for misinterpretation" on a matter that the ambassador said was "crystal clear".The matter was South Africa's allegation before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Israel, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel has slammed the claim as false and "grossly distorted".It was not the first time Canada's prime minister has been asked to define his country's position on the case currently before the UN's highest court. Over the last few days, Mr Trudeau was asked to clarify numerous times where Canada stands on the ICJ case, after its close allies - including the US and the UK - rejected it.Mr Trudeau first told reporters that while Canada supports the ICJ, that did not mean it supported "the premise" of the case, a statement that was widely interpreted as a dismissal. He then said that Canada would abide by any ruling issued by the ICJ, but refused to comment on whether Canada agreed with the genocide allegation. It was the latest in a string of public statements that have led to accusations that Canada is mincing its words on a conflict that has sharply divided Canadians and much of the world.Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Conservative opposition party, said at a press conference last week that Mr Trudeau "sends out some of his MPs to claim that they support calling Israel genocidal when they are talking to one group of voters. And then he sends out another group to say that they're against calling Israel genocidal."Throughout the conflict, Mr Trudeau has been broadly in line with Canada's Western allies, repeatedly condemning Hamas's deadly attack on 7 October, while saying that Israel has right to defend itself. Like the US, UK, European Union and others, Canada classifies Hamas as a terrorist organisation.At the same time, he has also underscored the need to protect civilian lives and allow humanitarian aid inside Gaza. And on Thursday, he criticised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his statements against a future two-state solution, saying that Canada believed it was "the only way forward" for peace in the region. When pushed, however, Mr Trudeau has struggled to clearly explain Canada's position on the ongoing war, frustrating allies and opening himself up to criticism."Almost every step he's taken in this conflict has had the effect of upsetting everyone at different times," said Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, which regularly polls Canadians on national issues.That includes members of his own Liberal caucus, who, like the public, are deeply divided on the matter. On 20 October, Mr Trudeau was met with boos and shouts of "shame" at an Ontario mosque, where he made an unannounced visit. That same day, he was sent a letter signed by 23 members of his own caucus urging him to advocate for a ceasefire.But when Canada backed a UN General Assembly resolution for a humanitarian ceasefire on 12 December - a break from its historic support for Israel - tensions flared within Mr Trudeau's caucus.Liberal MP Anthony Housefather publicly criticised the government at the time, saying it was "unacceptable" for Canada to throw its weight behind a ceasefire resolution that did not explicitly ask Hamas to drop its weapons. The response forced the Trudeau government to release a lengthy statement explaining its vote and reiterating its support for Israel.Some have argued Mr Trudeau's vagueness may be part of a larger political calculus, especially given where most Canadians stand on the issue. Polling done by Ms Kurl's institute in November indicated that among Liberal voters, an almost identical number of people - about 20% - sympathise with either Israelis or Palestinians.Meanwhile, a large chunk of Canadians - about 31% - sympathise with both equally. "In terms of the overall population, there is perhaps more of an understanding that this issue is profoundly complex," Ms Kurl said. Still, the apparent ambiguity may be costing Mr Trudeau's Liberals some support, at a time when they are trailing behind Mr Poilievre's party in the polls.Aurel Braun, a professor of international relations at the University of Toronto, said he had seen an "unprecedented change" in what traditionally has been very strong support for the Liberal party within Canada's Jewish community. The prime minister's stance was not viewed as "a lack of clarity", he said, but rather as "a huge moral and ethical failure" at a time when antisemitic incidents were on the rise in Canada. Meanwhile, many Muslims are also frustrated with Mr Trudeau's lack of consistency, and with the country's politicians in general, according to Stephen Brown, head of the National Council of Canadian Muslims."You would never have seen that response prior to the conflict," said Mr Brown about the prime minister being booed at a mosque. The ambiguity was especially "hurtful", he said, at a time when Islamophobic incidents in Canada had also spiked.While Mr Trudeau has irked both sides, Ms Kurl noted that his comments, at least so far, have not caused any members of his own Liberal party to defect, despite "very passionate voices" within it. "It has been perhaps outwardly awkward for the prime minister," Ms Kurl said. But "he has managed to keep his caucus together".	
19/01/2024 17:54:00	Pakistan-Iran diplomatic ties restored after missile and drone strikes - BBC News	Pakistan and Iran have restored diplomatic ties according to the caretaker prime minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar's office.It comes after both countries exchanged drone and missile strikes on militant bases on each other's territory.As a result of the tit-for-tat attacks Iran and Pakistan withdrew their ambassadors from the respective capitals.Both ambassadors are now expected to return to their posts following talks.Iran said Thursday's strikes killed nine people in a border village on its territory, including four children. Pakistan said an Iranian attack on Tuesday killed two children.There has been no immediate comment from Iran on the talks.Earlier on Friday, Pakistan expressed its willingness to work with Iran on "all issues" following a call between their foreign ministers."Foreign Minister Jilani expressed Pakistan's readiness to work with Iran on all issues based on spirit of mutual trust and cooperation," the Pakistan foreign ministry said. "They also agreed to de-escalate the situation. The return of ambassadors of the two countries to their respective capitals was also discussed."The reciprocal attacks came as tensions in the Middle East are high with several overlapping crises.Israel is fighting the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza and exchanging fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.Meanwhile, Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria are targeting US forces, and the US and UK have struck the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, who have been attacking shipping.On Thursday, Pakistan's foreign ministry said its strikes around the Iranian city of Saravan had come in light of "credible intelligence of impending large-scale terrorist activities".The ministry added it "fully respects" Iran's "sovereignty and territorial integrity".Pakistan's army said the "precision strikes" were conducted with drones, rockets and long-range missiles and targeted the Balochistan Liberation Army and the Balochistan Liberation Front.Both groups are part of a decades-long struggle for greater autonomy in Balochistan, a remote region in south-western Pakistan.	
19/01/2024 16:43:00	Gaza war creating a radicalisation moment, senior UK police officer says - BBC News	The Israel-Gaza war has created a new "radicalisation moment" in the UK with the potential to push more people towards terrorism, the head of counter-terrorism policing has said. Matt Jukes said "extraordinary amounts" of online comment, amplified by misinformation and AI-generated false images, had fuelled the "intense risk".He compared the effect of the conflict to wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.There have now been 33 arrests under terrorism laws related to Israel-Gaza.These include people arrested for comments or slogans on protests. Officers would not confirm if terror plots had been detected.The official government estimate of the threat of a terror attack remains at "substantial" - the third highest level of five - meaning an attack is "likely".Briefing reporters on the threat of terrorism, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Matt Jukes said there had been 3,000 referrals to a counter-terrorism unit which monitors suspicious activity online. 700 had been identified as having a link to the UK, and potentially breaking the law. Some young children, including 11 and 12 year-olds, had been "engaging in troubling conversations"."All of that online material is part of a dangerous climate," Matt Jukes said. It had created a "radicalisation moment, with the potential to push people towards terrorism". "This is not simply rhetoric, we are seeing the signs of that intense risk," he added.There was a 13% increase in referrals in 2023 to the government's Prevent programme, which assesses the risk of radicalisation and attempts to intervene. Mr Jukes said potential terror attacks might not come immediately and "radicalisation can have a long tail".  But he warned: "In my seat you tend to look at dashboards of indicators and there are needles on that dashboard that are moving in the wrong direction."Detectives remain most concerned by the threat of a "lone actor" attack, possibly by "chaotic" individuals with poor mental health. A team of more than 20 officers is now dedicated to investigating potential war crimes, including allegations relating to Israel-Gaza. This has received 92 referrals connected with the conflict, of which 73 were against Israel and 19 against Hamas. Investigations are at an early "review" stage. The police have been criticised for dedicating resources to war crimes offences which include "crimes against humanity", genocide and torture. But senior officers stress that for every £100 pounds spent on counter-terrorism policing, only 30p goes on investigating war crimes. "We should not allow the UK to be a safe haven for war criminals," Mr Jukes said. Senior officers also say the UK has a legal duty to support the work of the International Criminal Court, and coroners' inquests into the deaths of British nationals. The problem detectives face is that they might receive "dossiers" of evidence that war crimes have been committed, but no first or second-hand eye witness accounts. Information tends to come from law firms, non-government organisations such as charities, and "people in the middle of conflict". The counter-terrorism command is also dealing with an increased threat from hostile states, principally Russia, Iran and China. In a recent case, an Austrian man, Magomed-Husejn Dovtaev, was jailed for three years after being spotted by security guards carrying out "hostile reconnaissance" on an Iranian media company in Chiswick, London, which had been threatened due to its reporting on Iran. Police are also concerned states targeting the UK are paying criminals to carry out their activities, because an organised crime gang may find it easier to operate across borders and move weapons than a spy. A new investigations team has been set up to counter hostile states, closely linked to the security and secret intelligence services, MI5 and MI6.	
19/01/2024 20:26:00	Kuehne+Nagel in Milton Keynes 'vandalised by Palestine Action' - BBC News	A campaign group supporting Palestine said it had vandalised the UK office of a global haulage company. Kuehne+Nagel confirmed its site in Milton Keynes was damaged early on Wednesday morning. Palestine Action said it was targeting companies that were supplying weapons to Israel.  Kuehne+Nagel declined to comment, while Thames Valley Police said it was investigating “significant criminal damage” at the site. Palestine Action claimed that Kuehne+Nagel provides “transportation and logistics services” for arms company Elbit Systems, which had contracts with Israel’s Ministry of Defence. A Palestine Action spokesperson said group members took action because "in the past 100 days over 25,000 Palestinians were killed".The campaign group said it was “determined” to target “companies assisting in the delivery and shipment of Israeli weaponry”. Thames Valley Police said: “Officers have visited the location and engaged with the victim. We are pursuing all lines of enquiry”.

19/01/2024 11:28:00	Gaza destruction risks lost generation of children, says UN official - BBC News	This week Al Israa University became the latest major public building in Gaza to disappear from the map, blown up and destroyed by Israeli forces who had reportedly used it as a military base for several weeks.The war in Gaza has already let to an unprecedented loss of life, but there's also growing concern about the destruction of public and private buildings.Now a senior UN official has told BBC News of his fears that the widespread damage will lead to a "lost generation" of young people.Israel declared war on Hamas after the group led a massive attack on communities inside Israel, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages. Around 130 remain in captivity. Almost 25,000 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry,The United Nations' Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) publishes regular bulletins on the impact of the war, and they make for grim reading.Its latest updates say that at least 60% of homes or housing units in Gaza have been "destroyed or damaged". Nine in every 10 schools have suffered "significant damage". Hospitals, public buildings and electricity networks have also been hit.  Amir Mohammed Al-Najjari is 22 years old. He's originally from Jabalia in northern Gaza but has been forced with his family to move to a makeshift camp near Khan Younis in the south. He and his siblings have seen their dreams disappear in clouds of smoke."My sister was studying in the third year of Al-Quds University, but it was bombed. And my brother was in his final year of school, at Khalil Al-Rahman school, but it too was bombed," says Amir sitting outside the makeshift tent the family now calls home.His own predicament mirrors his brother's and sister's. "I have finished my degree in engineering. If there was no war, I would have a job interview and perhaps I would have been accepted. Finally, there's my younger brother, who is in the seventh grade. He was studying in the UN school. Nothing is left of it."Like any society, Gaza's future is its children. But here, they're disproportionately victims of war and, says the UN, may lose out completely on what should be rightfully theirs  Phillippe Lazzarini is the Commissioner General for UNRWA - the UN agency with specific responsibility for Palestinian refugees. He's just returned from his fourth visit to Gaza since the start of the war."There are today more than half a million children in the primary and secondary school system. How will they go back if you cannot bring people back to their homes which have been completely destroyed," Mr Lazzarini tells me. "And I'm afraid that we're running the risk here of losing a generation of children."Images of Israeli troops cheering as educational institutions were blown up went viral on social media, including one showing the complete demolition of a distinctive blue UN school in northern Gaza.Such incidents have led to accusations of "collective punishment" - that Israel is methodically and deliberately destroying institutions including schools in retaliation for what happened when armed Hamas gunmen stormed over the Gaza fence on 7 October."Cogat" is the military division that co-ordinates Israeli government activities in the occupied Palestinian territories, including the supervision of aid convoys entering Gaza.When I asked a senior Cogat official why it was necessary to demolish an entire school after it had already been overrun by Israeli forces, he replied that "Hamas cynically invade and use civilian structures" (like schools) to launch attacks against Israeli troops.The official also said it was "fact" that Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups were using medical facilities as bases and that in virtually every hospital IDF soldiers had found "terrorist infrastructure". Whatever the veracity of those accusations - and they've been regularly challenged by health officials and aid agencies - Gaza's health system is broken.The World Health Organization says that only 13 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are functional, many have been damaged in airstrikes. With shortages in basic medical equipment those who need treatment often go without.Cancer patients and those requiring specialist treatment like kidney dialysis, or neo-natal babies, are especially vulnerable, says the Ocha bulletin.Nisreen Abu Nimr is also from northern Gaza. She is married, and was a mother to two children, one of whom was killed in a bombing earlier in the war. Nisreen has also been suffering from cancer since 2016."I was receiving regular medical treatment for my cancer at a hospital here in Gaza. But, during the Israeli aggression, medical treatments haven't been provided for four months," says Nisreen. Some prominent right-wing Israeli politicians, including members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, have suggested the only way to guarantee security for Israel is to "encourage" civilians to leave Gaza for Egypt or other Arab countries and to even re-establish Jewish settlements in the territory.Israel denies accusations of deliberately turning Gaza into a wasteland, but Mr Lazzarini fears the net impact is that people might have no choice but to leave."The facts on the ground are indeed pointing in this direction," he tells me, clearly anxious that the longer the fighting continues the worse the predicament for more than a million displaced Gazans will become. "What we have seen is a breakdown in civil order," adds Mr Lazzarini. "Virtually all infrastructure including water and electricity have been badly damaged, so basic public services in Gaza are not available any more."Cogat officials have disputed the scale of Gaza's humanitarian crisis and they told me Israel does not target civilians or public infrastructure, unless it is suspected of being used by armed Palestinian groups. They also say they're working daily in collaboration with UN agencies to get more aid into Gaza. With other key institutions like Gaza's parliament and a brand-new courthouse - the Palace of Justice, paid for by Qatar - also destroyed by Israeli forces, there's very little left of Gazan society.Israel's prime minister insists his military campaign in Gaza will continue until "total victory" and Hamas is no longer a threat to Israel. Official Israeli government policy is that ultimately no Israelis will remain in Gaza, but what will be left of the territory on the day when the war, eventually, ends?	
19/01/2024 07:18:00	Netanyahu publicly rejects US push for Palestinian state - BBC News	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has told the United States that he opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state once the conflict in Gaza comes to an end.In a news conference, a defiant Mr Netanyahu vowed to press on with the offensive in Gaza "until complete victory": the destruction of Hamas and return of the remaining Israeli hostages, adding that it could take "many more months".With almost 25,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and 85% of the Strip's population displaced, Israel is under intense pressure to rein in its offensive and engage in meaningful talks over a sustainable end to the war.Israel's allies, including the US - and many of its foes - have urged a revival of the long-dormant "two-state solution", in which a future Palestinian state would sit side-by-side with an Israeli one.The hope in many circles is that the current crisis could force the warring parties back to diplomacy, as the only viable alternative to endless cycles of violence. But from Mr Netanyahu's comments, his intention appears quite the opposite.Speaking to reporters following Mr Netanyahu's latest comments, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby recognised that the US and Israel "obviously" see things differently.Earlier on Thursday, Mr Netanyahu said Israel must have security control over all land west of the River Jordan, which would include the territory of any future Palestinian state. "This is a necessary condition, and it conflicts with the idea of (Palestinian) sovereignty. What to do? I tell this truth to our American friends, and I also stopped the attempt to impose a reality on us that would harm Israel's security," he said. Mr Netanyahu has spent much of his political career opposing Palestinian statehood, boasting just last month that he was proud to have prevented its establishment, so his latest remarks come as no surprise. But the very public rebuttal of Washington's diplomatic push, and determination to stay the current military course, show the chasm widening with Israel's western allies. Since the 7 October attacks - the worst in Israel's history, when Hamas gunmen killed about 1,300 Israelis and took some 240 hostage - the US has supported its right to defend itself. But as the death toll in Gaza has grown, and the scenes of horror there have abounded, Western governments have called for Israeli restraint. The White House has repeatedly tried to influence Israel's military policy: urging more precision-guided weapons rather than the blanket air strikes; discouraging a ground offensive; and calling for a two-state solution, with a role for the Palestinian Authority in post-conflict Gaza.Mr Kirby said the US has been "exceedingly clear" about what it wants Gaza to look like after the war. "We want governance in Gaza that's representative of the aspirations of the Palestinian people, that they have a vote and a voice in what that looks like and that there's no reoccupation of Gaza," he said.Washington's advice has frequently fallen on deaf ears or been met by outright rejection - often publicly so, during visits by the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.That, in turn, has hardened frustration in some American circles over the Biden administration's apparent blanket support for Israel, with strident calls to put conditions on US aid to its Middle East ally.Israel's prime minister's comments will please his dwindling support base and the far-right ministers who prop up his government. But they will dismay those at home and abroad who are increasingly horrified by the human cost of this war. Recent polls show most Israelis want him to prioritise bringing the remaining hostages home over the potentially impossible aim of destroying Hamas.   	
19/01/2024 02:33:00	Biden says US strikes on Houthis in Yemen have not stopped Red Sea attacks - BBC News	Houthi forces launched a new missile attack on a US-owned vessel on Thursday, after President Joe Biden said American strikes have not deterred the militants' campaign in the Red Sea. The Pentagon said no damage or injuries were reported after Houthis fired two missiles at the MV Chem Ranger. The attack followed a fifth round of US strikes in Yemen earlier on Thursday.The White House said US forces "took out a range of Houthi missiles" that were to be fired towards the Red Sea.Speaking after the US strikes, Mr Biden was asked by reporters in Washington DC if the attacks on Houthi targets were working."Well, when you say working are they stopping the Houthis? No," he said. "Are they gonna continue? Yes."US Central Command - which oversees US operations in the Middle East - said in a statement that it had "conducted strikes on two Houthi anti-ship missiles that were aimed into the Southern Red Sea and were prepared to launch" on Thursday."US forces identified the missiles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen" around 15:40 local time (12:40GMT) "and determined they were an imminent threat to merchant vessels and US Navy ships in the region". "US forces subsequently struck and destroyed the missiles in self-defense."Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh later told reporters at a briefing: "We do not seek war.""We are not at war with the Houthis. Actions we are taking are defensive in nature."Centcom also confirmed the attempted attack on the MV Chem Ranger. Officials said two anti-ship missiles were fired at the Marshall Island-flagged, US owned ship, but both fell short of the vessel. Yemen's military spokesperson earlier released a statement saying that there had been "direct hits" to the ship.A US-owned vessel was also hit on Wednesday, hours after Washington re-designated the Houthis as a terrorist organisation. In a fiery speech on Thursday, the leader of the Houthis called it a "great honour" to be "in direct confrontation" with Israel, the US and the UK."The aggression against our dear people is a violation, aggression, a direct encroachment of the sovereignty of Yemen and a direct assault on the Yemeni people", said Abdul Malik al-Houthi.The Houthis began attacking merchant vessels in November, saying they were responding to Israel's military operation in Gaza. Since then, the group has launched dozens of attacks on commercial tankers passing through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.In response, the US and UK launched a wave of air strikes against dozens of Houthi targets on 11 January. The strikes - supported by Australia, Bahrain, the Netherlands and Canada - began after Houthi forces ignored an ultimatum to cease attacks in the region.	
18/01/2024 21:32:00	Israeli troops push deep into Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis - BBC News	Israel says its troops have reached the southernmost area of Khan Younis, as they expand their operations in the Gaza Strip's second biggest city.The military announced that dozens of Palestinian fighters from Hamas had been killed in "close quarter combat".Armed groups also reported clashes in the area, while health officials said 172 people had been killed across Gaza.Meanwhile, Israel's president said he was praying that medicines delivered to the Strip would reach Israeli hostages.Qatar said on Wednesday night that the supplies had arrived via the border crossing with Egypt, along with a shipment of humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians, under an agreement it had brokered between Israel and Hamas.A spokesman for Qatar's foreign ministry told CNN on Thursday that there was every likelihood that the medicines had reached the hostages, but that it would be difficult to confirm because of a near-total communication blackout. Majid al-Ansari also said that Palestinian health authorities had been tasked with handing over the medication, rather than a neutral intermediary like the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)."The security situation is certainly not easy. It would be very difficult to involve the Red Cross or any other organisation at the moment," he added. The ICRC also stated that the "mechanism that was agreed to does not involve the ICRC playing any part in its implementation".The medicines are supposed to be delivered to some 45 of the more than 100 Israeli hostages in Gaza, who are reported to be suffering from chronic diseases or in need of other life-saving drugs.On Thursday, President Isaac Herzog was among the many Israelis who marked the first birthday of the youngest hostage, Kfir Bibas. Hamas has claimed the baby was killed in an Israeli air strike, along with his four-year-old brother Ariel and their mother Shiri in November. without providing evidence. "His whereabouts are unknown," Mr Herzog said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, sitting next to a photograph of the infant. "I call upon the entire universe to work endlessly to free Kfir and all the hostages."Hamas gunmen took about 250 people hostage and killed 1,300 others when they carried out an unprecedented cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, Israeli authorities say.More than 24,600 people have been killed in Gaza since the Israeli military launched a large-scale air and ground campaign in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Thursday morning that infantry soldiers from the Givati Brigade in Khan Younis were "now fighting in the southernmost area that IDF ground troops have operated in so far".The troops had "eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat and with the assistance of tank fire and air support", and raided the "Martyrs' Outpost" of the Southern Battalion of Hamas's Khan Younis Brigade, it added.It did not say where the fighting took place, but Hamas's military wing reported that its fighters had fired at Israeli soldiers and shelled a tank and armoured bulldozer in the southern Batn al-Samin area on Wednesday. Palestinian Islamic Jihad - the second biggest armed group in Gaza - also said there had been fierce clashes in the south of Khan Younis on Thursday.Meanwhile, civilians have been fleeing the city as the fighting closes in, including many displaced families sheltering at Nasser Hospital in the west of Khan Younis, which is Gaza's largest functioning health facility.According to a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) surgeon, there was panic at the hospital after Israeli forces heavily bombed a nearby area on Tuesday night without issuing an evacuation order.An Israeli government spokesman could not confirm the attack but accused Hamas fighters of hiding behind civilians and embedding themselves in medical facilities.In a video recorded during a visit on Tuesday, MSF head of mission Leo Cans warned that the situation at Nasser Hospital was "catastrophic", with "way too many patients for the staff to handle".The deputy director of the UN children's agency (Unicef), Ted Chaiban, also visited the hospital on the same day.He recalled meeting a 13-year-old boy called Ibrahim whose badly injured hand became infected. "Without medicine, gangrene took hold and he ultimately lost his arm during an amputation without anaesthetic," he said.On Wednesday night, 16 people, half of them children, were killed in a strike on a house further south in Rafah, local medics and health officials said.Umm Walid al-Zamli said she had rushed to the local hospital after the attack and found that all of her children were dead."They were all so young. The eldest was in second grade," she told AFP news agency. "What did they do wrong?"Rafah, a small town near the Egyptian border, has been overwhelmed by more than half of the 1.9 million people - nearly 85% of Gaza's population - who the UN estimates have been fled their homes over the past 14 weeks."The sheer mass of civilians on the border is hard to fathom and the conditions they live in are inhumane," Mr Chaiban of Unicef warned in a statement on Thursday. "Water is scarce and poor sanitation is inescapable. The cold and rain this week created rivers of waste."Mr Herzog defended Israel's actions, saying it was left with no choice."I'm not shying away from the human tragedy in Gaza. And you want to know something? We care," he said. "It is painful for us that our neighbours are suffering so much. But how else can we defend ourselves if our enemies decided to entrench themselves in an infrastructure of terror of unbelievable size?"	
18/01/2024 18:17:00	Why did Iran launch strikes on its allies' territory? - BBC News	Iran has launched strikes against targets in three allied countries - Syria, Iraq and Pakistan - in two days. Pakistan responded with a missile attack on Iranian territory. So why did Iran do it, and why did it happen now? Everything suggests Iran's military, the Revolutionary Guards, were under pressure to act from Islamic hardliners inside the country.These hardliners are increasingly unhappy with Iran apparently standing by as Israel kills huge numbers of Palestinians in Gaza.They are also angry that Iran did nothing after its arch-enemy Israel assassinated a number of top Revolutionary Guard commanders in Syria - and only verbally supported the Houthis when they came under US-UK strikes.And then there's the bomb attack claimed by the Islamic State group (IS) in the Iranian city of Kerman two weeks ago, which killed at least 84 people.  The Guards felt they had to act somehow, without ratcheting up tensions with Israel or the US. Iran has been careful not to get directly involved in the Israel-Gaza war - though it does offer military support to Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah.But in striking Syria, Iraq and Pakistan, they appear to have have scored a few own goals.Iran said the missile and drone attack inside Pakistan targeted militant group Jaish al-Adli - what it calls an "Iranian terrorist group". But Pakistan says it killed two children.Pakistan, a nuclear power, felt it had to respond to the strike - which was a clear violation of Pakistani sovereignty and territorial integrity. It also undermined Pakistan's nuclear deterrence.So it launched attacks of its own against what it said were hideouts of Pakistani "terrorists" based in Iran - the Balochistan Liberation Army and the Balochistan Liberation Front. Iran says three women, two men and four children were killed.The tit-for-tat attacks have left the normally good relations between the neighbours seriously damaged. The Revolutionary Guard did not anticipate this reaction from Pakistan.Iran and Pakistan share a 900km (560 mile) border which is difficult for either to control without cooperation. Pakistan has been a valuable ally in international forums, often voting in favour of Tehran. The attack on Syria appears to have been in response to the killings in Kerman. But even there, there are no reports of a big hit against IS or hardline Sunni groups, as Iran claims. In Iraq - perhaps Iran's closest neighbour and ally - the government is infuriated by attacks where Iran used some 11 ballistic missiles to hit a target in Irbil, in the Iraqi region of Kurdistan.Iran claimed it had targeted an operations centre of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. But Iraqi and Kurdish authorities say the house of a well-known businessman was hit, killing him along with his wife and two children, one of whom was under one year old. Iraq's government has complained to the UN Security Council, which is due to discuss the attacks. The incident has eroded neighbourly relations cultivated over years, in spite of several issues between the two nations.The Revolutionary Guards may have taken the decision to launch the attacks against the three countries after only consulting Iran's supreme leader. There are signs the foreign minister was not consulted before the attacks were launched.The attacks this week appear to have undermined Iran's international position further, putting its defences at risk and making the Revolutionary Guard look reckless and prone to taking uncalculated risks.	
18/01/2024 17:03:00	Pakistan launches retaliatory strikes into Iran, killing nine people - BBC News	Pakistan has launched missile strikes into Iran, killing nine people, after Iran carried out strikes in Pakistan late on Tuesday.Pakistan said its strikes had hit "terrorist hideouts" in Iran's south-eastern Sistan-Baluchestan province.Iran condemned the attack, which it said killed three women, two men and four children who were not Iranian. The country's foreign ministry later said it was committed to good neighbourly relations with Pakistan. However, it called on Islamabad to prevent the establishment of "bases and armed terrorist groups" on its soil.The reciprocal attacks come as tensions in the Middle East are high with several overlapping crises.Israel is fighting the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza and exchanging fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.Meanwhile, Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria are targeting US forces, and the US and UK have struck the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, who have been attacking shipping.Thursday's strikes by Pakistan were the first external land attack on Iran since Saddam Hussein's forces invaded in the 1980s - launching a brutal eight-year war.Pakistan's foreign ministry said its strikes around the Iranian city of Saravan had come in light of "credible intelligence of impending large-scale terrorist activities" and added that it "fully respects" Iran's "sovereignty and territorial integrity".In its own statement, Pakistan's army said the "precision strikes" were conducted with drones, rockets and long-range missiles and targeted the Balochistan Liberation Army and the Balochistan Liberation Front. Both groups are part of a decades-long struggle for greater autonomy in Balochistan, a remote region in south-western Pakistan. Pakistan had fiercely condemned Iran's strike on Tuesday, which struck an area of Pakistan's Balochistan province near the Iranian border and which Islamabad said killed two children.The country's former foreign minister, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, told the BBC he was surprised at the attack because Iran's foreign minister met with Pakistan's acting prime minister on "the day they violated the sovereignty of our country".He added "it would be a mistake" for a country to think Pakistan can't respond to violations, and says it sends a "clear message that Pakistan has both the will and ability to respond".Iran insisted its strikes were aimed only at Jaish al-Adl, or "army of justice", an ethnic Baloch Sunni Muslim militant group (formerly called Jundullah) that has carried out attacks inside Iran, and not Pakistan's citizens.Iranian state media reported on Thursday that Tehran had summoned Pakistan's chargé d'affaires over the strikes. Pakistan had earlier recalled its ambassador and blocked the Iranian envoy from returning.China, Turkey and the Taliban government in Afghanistan have all called for restraint and dialogue. Earlier in the week Iran also attacked targets in Iraq and Syria. It said it had hit Islamic State and Israel's Mossad spy agency, both of which it said had been involved in a bomb attack in the Iranian city of Kerman earlier this month which killed 84 people.Iran and Pakistan have complicated but cordial relations. Their ministers met at Davos this week and their navies conducted joint exercises in the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf.The two countries have similar concerns about the lawless border area, where drug smugglers and militant Baloch groups are very active. After both sets of air strikes, each side seemed anxious to emphasise that these did not represent attacks on a brotherly neighbour. Tehran's reaction to the Pakistani strike appears relatively muted and the authorities have said that the victims, who included women and children, were not Iranian nationals.Michael Kugelman, South Asia director at the Wilson Center, said that while Pakistan's retaliation raises the risk of escalation, "it also provides an opportunity to step back from the brink"."In effect, the two sides are even now. Islamabad had a strong incentive to try to restore deterrence, especially with Iran on the offensive around the wider region deploying direct strikes and proxies to hit out at threats and rivals. In effect, if Pakistan had held back, it would have faced the risk of additional strikes," he said.Others suggested that the government in Islamabad was under domestic pressure to respond. The country, which saw its former leader Imran Khan removed nearly two years ago, is holding an election next month."There was a lot of public pressure on the government to do something and so they have done this just to prove that they are not less than [Iran], this act of sabre-rattling," said retired Lt General Asif Yaseen, a former Pakistani defence secretary.But he said he had a "gut feeling that this will stop here for both the countries" and Pakistan could now be in a position to restart dialogue with Iran.Some commentators have suggested Iran's strikes on Iraq, Syria and Pakistan this week were also driven by the current turbulent dynamics in the Middle East.Tehran has said it does not want to get involved in the wider Israel-Gaza conflict, but groups that it backs have been targeting Israel and its allies to show solidarity with the Palestinians.  However, Shashank Joshi, defence editor at The Economist, said he does not believe the strikes are an outcome of the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, which killed about 1,300 people and triggered Israeli retaliation against Hamas in Gaza, which officials from the Hamas-run health ministry there say has killed about 24,000 people. "The story here is about Iran flexing its muscles, perhaps outraged by what it saw as a grievous assault on its country," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, referring to the deadly bomb attack in Kerman earlier this month, which he described as "the worst terrorist attack in Iran since the revolution of 1979". "Iran is wounded and is lashing out. I don't think there's any compelling reason to say the bombing was caused by, or is an outcome of 7 October," he said.He adds that this is "not the first time there have been border tensions, but it is by far and away the most serious escalation in tensions that I can remember". 	
18/01/2024 12:17:00	Suspected Jordanian air strikes in southern Syria kill 10 - activists - BBC News	At least 10 people, including children, have been killed in suspected Jordanian air strikes in south-western Syria, local activists and media say.Several homes were reportedly destroyed in Arman, a town in Suweida province about 20km (12 miles) from the border.There was no immediate comment from authorities in Jordan.But its forces are believed to have carried out a number of air strikes in Syria over the past year on suspected drug smugglers and their facilities.Jordan and its Western allies say highly organised and heavily armed Iran-backed militias operating in government-controlled areas of Syria are behind a surge in smuggling into the kingdom, particularly of the amphetamine Captagon, for which there is huge demand in Gulf Arab states.The activist-run Suwayda 24 news website reported that the latest air strikes happened early on Thursday in residential areas of Arman and nearby Malah.It cited witnesses as saying that the houses of two men, whom it identified as Omar Talab and Turki al-Halabi, were hit and destroyed in Arman. Mr Talab, his mother and his aunt were killed, as well as seven members of Mr Halabi's family including his wife and two young daughters, the witnesses added. Mr Halabi and his mother were reportedly trapped underneath their collapsed home and presumed dead.Suwayda 24 posted a video showing people searching for victims at one site. The local fire brigade later said Mr Halabi's body had been recovered and that crews were searching for another person.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said at least nine people were killed in the strikes on Arman, including five women and two children, and that a sixth woman was trapped beneath rubble. The Observatory condemned what it called the "massacre" in Arman and said this was the third time this year that Jordanian warplanes had "violated Syrian territory".The strikes also targeted a damaged a warehouse and a nearby house in Malah, but no casualties were reported, it added.On 8 January, Suwayda 24 said three people were killed in two separate strikes that hit a house and a farm in the town of Shaab as well as a barn in Arman.One of the website's editors, Ryan Marouf, told Reuters news agency the following day that the strike appeared to be an "escalation by Jordan of its war against drug dealers".He added that Jordanian forces were "targeting farms suspected of storing drugs before they are smuggled across the border, as well as the main homes and hideouts of known drug dealers".The Jordanian army also announced on 6 January that it had killed five people in clashes with armed smugglers who had attempted to cross from Syria.

18/01/2024 02:50:00	US launches fourth round of strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen - BBC News	The US has carried out a fourth round of strikes on Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, Pentagon officials confirmed on Wednesday night. Some 14 Houthi missiles, which the US says may have been intended for attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, were targeted by American forces. Centcom - the US Middle East command - said the sites were struck by Tomahawk missiles fired from US Navy vessels.The strikes come as the US designated the Houthis as "global terrorists".US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the move, which reversed a decision to remove the designation in the early days of the Biden administration, was in response to the militants' ongoing attacks on commercial shipping in the region.The Houthis began attacking merchant vessels in November, saying they were responding to Israel's military operation in Gaza. Since then, the group has launched dozens of attacks on commercial tankers passing through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.In response, the US and UK launched a wave of air strikes against dozens of Houthi targets on 11 January. The strikes - supported by Australia, Bahrain, the Netherlands and Canada - began after Houthi forces ignored an ultimatum to cease their attacks in the region.Wednesday's strikes on Houthi targets followed further attacks on commercial shipping. Hours earlier, the group struck a US owned and operated vessel for the second time this week. The rebels used a one-way drone to target the M/V Genco Picardy in the Gulf of Aden, Centcom said. The ship suffered some damage, but no crew members were injured in the attack. On Monday, the Houthis hit another US vessel with a ballistic missile, in what appeared to be the group's first successful attack on an American ship since their campaign began. US officials said Wednesday's strikes were pre-emptive, and destroyed weapons which were due to be fired imminently by the militants. "These missiles on launch rails presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and US Navy ships in the region and could have been fired at any time, prompting US forces to exercise their inherent right and obligation to defend themselves," Centcom said in a statement. "These strikes, along with other actions we have taken, will degrade the Houthi's capabilities to continue their reckless attacks on international and commercial shipping in the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden," the statement added. The UK's ministry of defence told the BBC that it was not involved in the latest wave of strikes. Centcom's commander, Gen Micheal Kurilla, said the US would continue to take action against the Houthis as long as its fighters "continue to endanger international mariners and disrupt the commercial shipping lanes in the Southern Red Sea and adjacent waterways". Yemen has been devastated by a civil war that escalated in 2015, when the Houthis seized control of large parts of the west of the country from the internationally recognised government and a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an effort to restore its rule.The fighting has reportedly left more than 160,000 people dead and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, with two thirds of the population - 21 million people - in need of some form of aid.	
17/01/2024 22:02:00	Yemen strikes: Houthis hit US-owned ship after 'terror' designation - BBC News	Yemen's Houthis have targeted a US-owned vessel in the Gulf of Aden after Washington said it will re-designate the group as "global terrorists".The group said they hit the "Genco Picardy" bulk carrier with missiles which resulted in a "direct hit".The US military says the vessel was hit by a drone on Wednesday evening. Washington's new designation of the Houthis will require US financial institutions to freeze Houthi funds and its members will be banned from the US.The Houthi attacks in the Gulf of Aden and neighbouring Red Sea are a response to Israel's military operation in Gaza.Earlier this month, the UK and US launched air strikes on dozens of Houthi targets in Yemen in an attempt to stop the group from targeting vessels in the waters.On Wednesday evening, a Houthi spokesperson said the group had successfully targeted the Genco Picardy, and that the attack was a response to "the American-British aggression against our country".The US military said the ship was hit by a drone launched from Houthi controlled areas in Yemen. It said there was some damage but no injuries, and the vessel remained seaworthy. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the re-designation of the Houthis as "global terrorists" is in response to the Iran-backed group's attacks on commercial shipping in the region. The move to re-designate the Houthis reverses Secretary of State Antony Blinken's 2021 decision to remove the rebels from the US Specially Designated Global Terrorist List (SDGT).In a statement, Mr Sullivan said the recent Houthi attacks "fit the textbook definition of terrorism", as they have put US personnel in danger and jeopardized global trade operations."If the Houthis cease their attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, the United States will immediately re-evaluate this designation," Mr Sullivan added. In the waning days of the Trump administration officials imposed the SDGT and foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) labels on the Houthis.This action was taken despite warnings from the UN and aid groups that it could push war-torn Yemen into a large-scale famine.But in 2021, shortly after President Joe Biden's inauguration, that decision was reversed by Mr Blinken, the newly installed Secretary of State. He cited the dire humanitarian situation faced by the people of Yemen. Speaking to reporters ahead of Wednesday's announcement, senior administration officials defended the decision to reinstate the SDGT designation but not the FTO designation, which they said had been taken to ensure the continued flow of aid into Yemen. "It was the correct step to revoke," one official said, arguing that it was a move taken in "recognition of a very dire humanitarian situation" in the country and to ensure that "US policies weren't impeding" civilians' access to urgent aid. But they accepted that the Houthis' campaign of attacks on commercial shipping, which has now seen dozens of missiles fired at vessels in the Red Sea, has become "unacceptable". The new SDGT designation will also bar people and companies in the US from offering any support to the Houthis. However, officials were keen to emphasise that a range of exemptions will be worked into the new designation to ensure humanitarian aid continues to flow into Yemen, a country devastated by almost a decade of civil war. "We are rolling out unprecedented carve outs and licenses to help prevent adverse impacts on the Yemeni people," said Mr Sullivan in his statement. "The people of Yemen should not pay the price for the actions of the Houthis."The Houthis began attacking merchant vessels in November, saying they were responding to Israel's military operation in Gaza. Since then, the group has launched dozens of attacks on commercial tankers passing through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. In response, the US and UK launched a wave of air strikes against dozens of Houthi targets on 11 January. The strikes - supported by Australia, Bahrain, the Netherlands and Canada - began after Houthi forces ignored an ultimatum to cease their attacks in the region. Biden administration officials denied that the new terrorist designation was an acceptance that the air campaign may not deter further Houthi attacks. "We see these sanctions as one piece of a broader effort to bring the Houthis back from the terror attacks they are currently committing," one official said. "Our sanctions are best not seen in isolation but as part of a broader effort." In the wake of last week's strikes, the Houthis said the US and UK would "soon realise" the action was "the greatest folly in their history"."America and Britain made a mistake in launching the war on Yemen because they did not benefit from their previous experiences," senior Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti wrote on social media. Yemen has been devastated by a civil war that escalated in 2015, when the Houthis seized control of large parts of the west of the country from the internationally recognised government and a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an effort to restore its rule.The fighting has reportedly left more than 160,000 people dead and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, with two thirds of the population - 21 million people - in need of some form of aid.	
17/01/2024 17:43:00	West Bank strike: Israel accused of targeting civilians in deadly attack - BBC News	Israel is accused of having targeted a group of Palestinian civilians with no links to armed groups and who posed no threat to Israeli forces, according to witnesses in the occupied West Bank. Seven men - four of them brothers - were killed in an Israeli air strike early on 7 January, as they sat around a fire next to the road through al-Shuhada village, 10km (six miles) from the city of Jenin.The BBC has spoken to relatives of the men killed, witnesses in the area at the time, and a paramedic at the scene. All provided strong evidence that the men were not members of armed militant groups, and that no clashes with Israeli forces were taking place in the location at the time.Khalid al-Ahmad, the first paramedic to arrive that morning, is convinced the men were doing nothing wrong."One of them was wearing slippers and pyjamas," he told the BBC. "Don't you think that someone who wants to resist [the Israeli occupation] would at least wear proper shoes?"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has linked the strike to a military operation hours earlier in Jenin refugee camp, in which a female soldier was killed.The IDF directed us to a statement it released at the time, which said that "during the operation, an aircraft struck a terrorist squad that hurled explosives at the forces operating in the area".Footage from both the IDF and a nearby CCTV camera does not show any clear evidence of confrontations with Palestinians in al-Shuhada at the time of the strike.The four brothers - Alaa, Hazza, Ahmad, and Rami Darweesh - were aged between 22 and 29 years old. They were Palestinian emigrants who had returned from Jordan a few years earlier with their mother and five siblings.They had Israeli permits, allowing them to cross into Israel for agricultural work each day. These permits are often difficult to obtain and are rapidly withdrawn from anyone Israel sees as a security threat - or as linked to someone who is.The three men killed with them were members of their extended family. Permits for two of the brothers, seen by the BBC, were issued in September 2023 and valid for several months. The borders with Israel have been closed to Palestinian workers since the Hamas attacks in October.The paramedic, Khalid al-Ahmad, said that after 20 years working in Jenin, he was used to scanning trauma sites for weapons or explosives, as a basic safety routine."I would tell you if there were weapons there," he said.  "Honestly, these were civilians. There was nothing relating to the resistance - no bullets, no weapons. And there was no Israeli presence at all."Armed Palestinian groups - usually quick to claim any members killed by Israeli forces - have been silent about these seven men, with no statement describing any of them as "martyrs" for their cause.At their funeral, their bodies were wrapped in the flags of Palestinian groups, including Hamas. The bodies of those killed by Israel are often wrapped in the flags of movements supported by friends or family members - even when the deceased are not supporters themselves.Relatives and neighbours all told us the men had no connection with militant groups - as did the head of Jenin's main hospital, Wissam Bakr, where the bodies were brought that morning."They are not armed, they are not fighters," he said. "Normally, it's clear from the people if he's a fighter with one of the militant groups. These seven? No, no, it's sure, all of them are civilians."It was at the hospital that the men's mother, Ibtesam Asous, saw her sons' bodies."They were all gone," she said. "I expected that one of them might have been martyred, but not all four of them. I was shocked when I saw that they had all been killed."We asked the Israeli army to explain why this group of men was targeted.  A spokesperson replied that soldiers had begun pursuing the "terrorists who murdered an Israeli citizen" and that the air strike targeted "a terrorist squad that hurled explosives at the forces operating in the area, putting them in danger".Hours before the air strike in al-Shuhada, a 19-year-old border policewoman, Shai Germai, was killed when her vehicle hit an explosive device during clashes with Palestinian fighters in Jenin Camp.Afterwards, the army convoy withdrew from Jenin through al-Shuhada, where the Darweesh brothers had gathered with their three distant relatives, near an all-night coffee shop popular with agricultural workers and customers for the nearby dawn vegetable market.Night-vision drone footage provided by the IDF shows small flashes followed by an explosion as vehicles pass along the road - a heat pattern that could be produced by a petrol bomb.  The video does not have a date-stamp or time-stamp.The army also provided similar footage of its air strike on the location - but the two pieces of video are cut and edited together, making it impossible to tell how much time passed between them.  We asked the IDF to clarify the timings of both events. It replied that it would not be providing any more comment or information.The timing is important, because of the circumstances needed under international law to justify using lethal force.The UN's human rights body described the situation in the West Bank at the end of last year as "alarming and urgent"."Israeli forces have increasingly used military tactics and weapons in law enforcement operations," a statement from its spokesperson said in November. "Law enforcement is governed by international human rights law, which prohibits the intentional use of lethal force except when strictly necessary to protect life."Ibtesam Asous, the men's mother, said she had seen a change in the methods used by Israeli forces in the West Bank since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October."They are acting just as they used to," she said. "The only thing that changed is that, before, the army would shoot a guy in his leg. But now it's bigger - now they are bombing with rockets and killing as many people as they can."According to UN figures, last year was the bloodiest on record in the West Bank: 492 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces - 300 of them since the Hamas attacks in October, including 80 children.Almost all were killed with live ammunition.Twenty-eight Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed in the West Bank by Palestinians last year - including three since the attacks in October, two of whom were soldiers.Attacks have also been carried out by Palestinians inside Israel, including one earlier this week that killed one woman and injured 17 other people.Two witnesses who were in the coffee shop that morning told us that the army convoy left al-Shuhada between 04:00 and 04:45 local time (02:00-02:45 GMT), before the air strike took place, and that there were no clashes with local people."The soldiers passed four times and nobody approached them," one said. "When the [vehicles] were fully outside the village, they bombed. Young men, sitting near a fire to stay warm, were hit with a rocket."Another man told the BBC it was around an hour between the army leaving the village and the air strike happening around 05:00, and that many people in the coffee shop - including him - had left in between the two events.Khalid al-Ahmad, the paramedic from the Palestinian Red Crescent, remembers the Israeli army withdrawing from Jenin Camp in the early hours of the morning, and says it was "almost 5am" when he was called to the village after the strike.  The director at Jenin Hospital confirmed that the bodies had arrived there at around 05:15.CCTV footage from a nearby camera, part of which was filmed on a mobile phone by an unknown source, shows the 30 seconds immediately before the air strike, during which a car passes down the same stretch of empty road, apparently without incident. There is no time-stamp visible in the recording.A group of people - the Darweesh brothers and their relatives - can be seen standing and sitting around a fire. Then the air strike hits.Some of the brothers had been going to work, their mother said, while Hazza had been heading to an early morning dialysis appointment at Jenin Hospital.He was worried that the military operation would block the road, she said, and wanted to leave early.The hospital kidney unit confirmed that Hazza Darweesh had a regular 7am appointment for dialysis that day, and showed us his name on the schedule.A video taken by the brothers' uncle, Youssef Asous, shortly after the air strike shows bodies strewn across the ground. The experienced Jenin paramedic, Khalid al-Ahmad, said he despaired of ever being able to forget the scene."They were kids without weapons," Youssef said. "If they had weapons, I would have seen them. There were only the chairs they were sitting on.""At the end of the day, anyone Palestinian is a target - if you are an armed person, then you are targeted; and if you are a civilian, then you are also a target."We put all the allegations in this report to the IDF spokesperson, who repeated that the army had nothing more to add.Ibtesam Asous visited the site of the attack for the first time this week - her other children had tried to stop her coming, she said, but she had to see it for herself."I wanted to come and imagine where each of them was sitting," she explained, gesturing to different points on the ground as traffic thunders by.  "Alaa was there; Ahmad, Rami and Hazza were here. I wanted to see exactly where my sons were. It helps."Orsi Szoboszlay contributed to this article	
17/01/2024 17:15:00	Iran admits carrying out deadly strike on Pakistan territory - BBC News	Iran has admitted carrying out a missile and drone attack on western Pakistan on Tuesday.Officials in Islamabad said two children were killed and three others injured in the attack in Balochistan.Iran's foreign minister said the operation targeted the militant group Jaish al-Adl, which he described as an "Iranian terrorist group" in Pakistan. As a result the Pakistan's government recalled its ambassador to Iran and has blocked Tehran's envoy from returning. The Balochistan attack comes after Iran attacked targets in Iraq and Syria earlier this week. Islamabad said the attack was "illegal" and warned of "serious consequences".However Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, speaking in Davos, insisted that no Pakistani citizens had been targeted, only members of Jaish al-Adl."We only targeted Iranian terrorists on the soil of Pakistan," Mr Amir-Abdollahian said. He added he had spoken to his Pakistani counterpart and "assured him that we do respect sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan and Iraq". The latest air strike comes at a time of growing tension across the Middle East, with war raging between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza.Tehran says it does not want to get involved in a wider conflict. But groups in its so-called "Axis of Resistance", which include the Houthi militants in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon and various groups in Syria and Iraq, have been carrying out attacks on Israel and its allies to show solidarity with the Palestinians. The US and UK have launched air strikes on the Houthis after they attacked commercial shipping.China on Wednesday urged Pakistan and Iran to show "restraint" and "avoid actions that would lead to an escalation of tension". Foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning added that Beijing saw the countries as "close neighbours".Perhaps stung by recent deadly attacks on home soil, Iran seems intent on exacting revenge on those it sees as responsible.At a time of heightened regional tensions, Iran is keen to portray strength and demonstrate to its own population that acts of violence will not go unpunished. Tuesday's strike in Pakistan hit a village in the vast south-western border province of Balochistan. Tehran said it was targeting Jaish al-Adl, or "army of justice", an ethnic Baloch Sunni Muslim group that has carried out attacks inside Iran as well as on Pakistani government forces. Last December Jaish al-Adl attacked a police station in Rask, a town close to the border with Pakistan.Two weeks ago Iran suffered its worst domestic attack since the Islamic Revolution, when two bombs killed 84 people at a ceremony in Kerman to commemorate the US assassination of Iran's notorious Revolutionary Guard general, Qasem Soleimani.On Monday, Iran fired ballistic missiles at Syria and Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. Iran said it was targeting Islamic State and Israel's Mossad spy agency, both of whom it said had been involved in the Kerman bombings. The strike on Iraq hit a building in the northern city of Irbil. Four civilians were killed and six hurt in the attack, local authorities said. The US condemned the attack.Iran then struck Syria's north-western Idlib province, which is the last remaining opposition stronghold in the country and home to 2.9 million displaced people.But hitting its nuclear-armed eastern neighbour Pakistan is a dramatic escalation. Pakistan expressed outrage, saying the attack took place "despite the existence of several channels of communication" between the countries.On Wednesday Islamabad said it had recalled its ambassador to Iran and the Iranian ambassador would not be allowed back into the country for the time being.Pakistan and Iran have a delicate but cordial relationship. This attack took place on the same day as Pakistan's prime minister and Iran's foreign minister met in Davos and while the Iranian and Pakistan navies held military drills together in the Gulf.Yet both have accused one another of harbouring militant groups that carry out attacks on the other in their border areas for years. Security on either side of their shared border, which runs for about 900km (559 miles), has been a long-running concern for both governments.The Iranian strike is believed to have hit Sabz Koh village about 45km from the Iranian border and 90km from the nearest town Panjgur. Local officials described it as a sparsely populated area home to livestock-owning Baloch tribes where smuggling of goods, drugs and weapons is rife."People on both sides of the border consider themselves to be deprived of basic necessities, face discrimination and demand a larger share from their own resources," security commentator Zaigham Khan told the BBC. In Iran, the Sunni Muslim Baloch minority complains of discrimination in the Shia Muslim-majority state, while Baloch separatist groups are continuing an insurgent movement against the Pakistani government.Jaish al-Adl is the "most active and influential" Sunni militant group operating in Sistan-Baluchestan, according to the office of the US Director of National Intelligence. It is designated as a terrorist group by Washington and Tehran.Another security commentator in Pakistan, Aamir Rana, told the BBC he thought the diplomatic crisis "would take a while to calm down but this is also something that Pakistan would not like to escalate". He said in the past Pakistan had not reacted to Iran's actions along the border - "but now the ball is in Iran's court, whether it wants to get its act right".

17/01/2024 16:11:00	Intense Israeli strikes in south Gaza city as hostages sent medicine - BBC News	Residents of Khan Younis in southern Gaza say they have faced one of the most intense nights of air strikes since the start of Israel's offensive.Videos showed flames light up the sky as the sounds of Israeli bombings and gunfire reverberated across the city.  Displaced families have been fleeing a local hospital as fighting closes in.  Meanwhile, medicines are being sent for Israeli hostages held by Hamas in exchange for more aid for Palestinian civilians under a Qatar-mediated deal.The White House says Qatar has also been overseeing "very serious, extensive discussions" about a possible new hostage release deal, which were joined by a US envoy."This is the loudest sound of armed clashes [between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian fighters] that I've ever heard," Yasser Zaqzouq, who has been sheltering at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis with his family, told the BBC.  "This is the first time we saw such scenes [of air strikes]. We were in terror. All the kids were screaming and crying."A local journalist, Tariq Dahlan, said: "There is a state of panic among the displaced people in the hospital.""People are running away from this area towards the West, but nobody knows where they're going and what his fate will be."Israeli tanks were said to be just metres from the hospital.A woman in southern Gaza, who did not wish to be named, said children could not sleep "because of the sounds of missiles"."We are living in fear and terror," she told the BBC, adding that many of the children had begun to wet themselves out of fear. "The air strikes were very intense and very close around my house," another resident who lives opposite Nasser hospital, Abu Omar Al-Husseini, told the BBC."We fled under fire at dawn today. We carried a few blankets and walked for 5km (3.1 miles) to reach the entrance to the city of Rafah, and now we are in the street, not knowing where to go."On Wednesday the Jordanian army said its military field hospital in Khan Younis had been badly damaged as a result of Israeli shelling in the area. The Jordanian army said it held Israel responsible for a "flagrant breach of international law".The UN says that the war has displaced around 85% of Gaza's 2.3 million people, many of whom have been forced to cram into shelters and are struggling to get basic supplies.In a joint statement, a number of UN special rapporteurs said: "Currently every single person in Gaza is hungry, a quarter of the population are starving and struggling to find food and drinkable water, and famine is imminent."Israel's Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, has said that the intense stage of Israel's military operations against Hamas would "soon" wind down in the south of Gaza, including Khan Younis, where it is thought local leaders of the armed group may be hiding.He said that the military had already switched to more targeted action in the north, where it began its ground offensive.  However, in recent days, the return of Israeli tanks to parts of the north which ground forces had previously left has led some Gazans - who had been planning to return home - to think again.  Israeli military officials have repeatedly warned that the fighting will continue for months.Qatar now says that medicines are being flown from Doha to El-Arish in northern Egypt to be transported to Gaza, as part of a deal it brokered between Israel and Hamas.The plan had previously been announced but was apparently held up by logistical problems.It is not clear how exactly the medicines will be delivered to some 45 of the remaining more than 100 Israeli hostages, who are reported to be suffering from chronic diseases or in need of other life-saving drugs.The Israeli prime minister's office said "Qatari representatives in the Gaza Strip" would be involved and it is thought that the International Committee of the Red Cross may have a role.The agreement is also said to involve a significant increase in medicines for Palestinians. On Tuesday, the White House spokesman, John Kirby said Washington was "hopeful" that a new deal could soon be reached to free the hostages.Both Qatar and Egypt, who are key mediators, have recently laid out plans that would see them released in exchange for a halt in fighting.	
17/01/2024 14:28:00	Iran demonstrates missile capabilities with regional strikes - BBC News	With its strikes on Iraqi, Syrian and Pakistani territory, Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) is showing it has become a major regional military power.The IRGC openly states that US bases in the Middle East, as well as Israeli bases in Tel Aviv and Haifa, are within range of its ballistic missiles.In the space of only 24 hours, it gave a stark demonstration of its capabilities, launching missiles and drones at targets in three different countries.On Tuesday evening the IRGC attacked two targets inside neighbouring Pakistan, with media close to the force reporting that the strikes destroyed two bases of the militant group Jaish al-Adl in retaliation for the killing of Iranian border guards in recent weeks. Jaish al-Adl, a Sunni group that says it is fighting for the rights of ethnic Baloch people in south-eastern Iran, said two houses where the families of its members were living were hit.Pakistan called the strikes "completely unacceptable", saying they resulted in the death of two children, and warned of "serious consequences".There was similar condemnation from Iraq, Iran's western neighbour, after the IRGC launched 11 ballistic missiles at Irbil, the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region. At least four civilians were killed, according to the regional government, whose Prime Minister Masrour Barzani called the attack a "crime against the Kurdish people".Fars news agency, which is close to the IRGC, claimed that "headquarters" of Israel's Mossad spy agency were destroyed in the strikes. The Kurdistan Region Security Council said it categorically rejected the "unfounded pretext", while Israel remained silent.Four of the IRGC's missiles destroyed the home of the prominent Kurdish businessman Peshraw Dizayee. He was killed in the attack, reportedly alongside his 11-month-daughter.An adviser to Mr Barzani said it was "absolutely preposterous to suggest [he] was involved in any kind of espionage, that he worked for Israel", but Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian insisted on Wednesday that the IRGC did not make a mistake.Dizayee owned and founded two companies - Falcon Group and Empire World - following the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. He was close to the powerful Barzani family, which is headed by the prime minister's father and Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Massoud Barzani.The Falcon Group operates in various sectors, including security, construction, and oil and gas. Its security division has provided assistance to Western representatives and companies in Iraq.The Irbil attack appeared to underscore the message that not only can the IRGC carry out precision strikes, but also that it has the ability to strike military installations near Irbil's international airport, where US and other foreign forces are stationed.The IRGC's claim to have targeted Israeli facilities in Irbil also served a domestic political purpose in Iran, following a suspected Israeli strike in Syria on 25 December that killed a senior commander.Monday night also saw the IRGC launch ballistic missiles at what it said were the bases of Islamic State (IS) group and "terrorist groups" in Syria's north-western province of Idlib.Idlib is the last remaining stronghold of the Syrian opposition after 12 years of war against the government of President Bashar al-Assad, who has managed to stay in power because of the military backing of Russia and Iran. The Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sharm (HTS) dominates Idlib, although IS and al-Qaeda are also present there.The IRGC said the strikes in Idlib were carried out in retaliation for twin IS suicide bomb attacks in Kerman, in southern Iran, on 3 January, which killed 94 people. The bombers targeted crowds gathered near the tomb of Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani to mark the fourth anniversary of his assassination in a US drone strike.The IRGC said it used a Kheibar Shekan (Castle Buster) missile, which can travel up to 1,450km (900 miles), to target Idlib.It also said the missile was launched from the southern province of Khuzestan, even though it could have done so from the western province of Azerbaijan, which is much closer to Syria.The choice of missile and launch location suggest that Iran wants to convey to the world its ability to reach various locations in Israel, which borders Syria.

Nicknamed The Girl On A Bike, Vanessa Ruck, who grew up in Tunbridge Wells, was hit by a car while cycling in 2014. Seven years of recovery followed, requiring her to face seven surgical procedures, before she discovered motorcycles. Now, as well as taking part in races, she visits schools to inspire young girls to take part in different sports. The race followed the route of the old Dakar Rally from Nador in Morocco to Dakar in Senegal and finished on Sunday.Speaking to BBC South East from Dakar following the race, she said: "I'm absolutely shattered. I don't think every single muscle in my body, and my brain, have ever been this tired."She said: "You have to be so focussed. A second of lapse on your focus can mean you get lost, or the rock you don't see can take you off your bike."Ms Ruck said she undertook the 13-day race to prove that she still could face a challenge following her accident in 2014. "I've been determined to get myself back, maybe not to be pain-free, but to a point where I can get out there and make the most of every day."For me, coming from my accident and recovery, fighting to get to that finish line, was a way of going 'up you' to my accident, and saying 'you haven't controlled by whole life'."She said she had discovered a new love of motorcycles through her recovery. "The Dakar is the big famous event, it's the ultimate test."She said the longest day on her bike was 13.5 hours and some of the days were 90% on sand, with 400m high dunes. She said: "There aren't enough females doing these sorts of sports. I'm the first British female to ever finish this event, which I'm really proud of."She said: "I just want to get the word out, to show all those little girls who think they should be in princess dresses and have shiny nail polish that you can still have shiny nail polish and still race motorcycles too."

16/01/2024 23:28:00	Red Sea attacks: Greek vessel hit by missile fired by Houthi rebels - BBC News	Yemen's Houthi movement has hit another ship in the Red Sea off Yemen, the Iranian-backed rebel group says.The Greek-owned bulk carrier Zografia was sailing from Vietnam to Israel when it was struck on Tuesday. It is said to have suffered only minor damage.The incident comes as the US military announced it had seized Iranian-supplied weapons bound for the Houthis during an operation last week. Meanwhile, the US has hit more targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.Four anti-ship ballistic missiles that were ready to be launched were destroyed, an official told CBS, the BBC's American partner. The US and UK launched a wave of airstrikes against dozens of Houthi targets on 11 January following attacks by the group on shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthis began attacking merchant vessels in November, saying they were responding to Israel's military operation in Gaza.On Tuesday, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said the Zografia had been targeted by naval missiles, resulting in a "direct hit".The Greek-owned, Malta-registered ship was empty and had 24 crew onboard. There are no reports of injuries.The Houthis say they are attacking vessels that are Israeli-owned or operated, or are heading to Israeli ports. However, many of the ships targeted have no connections with Israel.On Sunday, the US said it had shot down a missile fired towards one of its warships from a Houthi area of Yemen.A day later, the group said they had carried out a ballistic missile strike on a US-owned cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden.The Red Sea connects the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal but several shipping lines have announced they are now diverting round the Cape of Good Hope to reach Europe instead.British oil giant Shell on Tuesday became the latest to suspend all of its shipments through the Red Sea indefinitely, according to the Wall Street Journal. The US said on Tuesday that it had seized advanced Iranian weapons that were being transported to the Houthis. The operation took place five days ago.The material found onboard a sailboat included components for ballistic and cruise missiles, among them warheads and guidance systems. Parts for air defence equipment were also seized.The US military said initial analysis indicated the Houthis had been using the same kinds of weapons in attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea."This is the first seizure of lethal, Iranian-supplied advanced conventional weapons (ACW) to the Houthis since the beginning of Houthi attacks against merchant ships in November," US Central Command said in a statement. Central Command also said a search is continuing for two Navy Seals who were lost overboard during the operation. Iran denied being behind the Houthi missile capability. The US says it is seeking to ease tension in the Middle East, despite repeated US military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. "We are not looking for regional conflict, far from it. Through a combination of steady deterrence and steadfast diplomacy, we seek to stop the spread of conflict and to create the conditions for de-escalation," National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said.But he added that much would depend on Iran and its support for the militants.	
16/01/2024 21:38:00	Israel Gaza war: Deal reached on aid to Gaza, including to hostages - BBC News	Israel and Hamas have reached a deal to allow more humanitarian aid into war-ravaged Gaza, Qatari mediators say.They say that under a deal brokered by Qatar and France, medicines will be given to hostages held by Hamas.In return Israel will allow more basic supplies into Gaza. Conditions in the territory are dire after more than three months of Israeli bombardment.Meanwhile the US says it is hopeful that further talks could lead to the release of more hostages.The US Middle East envoy has been in Qatar to discuss the possibility of such a deal, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday.The discussions were "very serious and intensive", he added . "We are hopeful it will bear fruit and bear fruit soon."Earlier, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al Ansari announced the agreement on aid. Under the deal, the humanitarian supplies will leave the Qatari capital, Doha, for Egypt on Wednesday. The aid will then be taken to Gaza, to be delivered to civilians, while medicines are to reach Israeli captives.More than 132 hostages are thought to be still held in Gaza. About 240 people were captured by Hamas in a series of raids in southern Israel on 7 October. Some 1,300 people, mainly civilians, were killed.In a letter sent to Israel's war cabinet after a ceasefire ended last year, the Hostages Families HQ group said many abductees needed regular medical attention and some were in immediate danger.Last week Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said David Barnea, head of Israel's national intelligence agency Mossad, had approached Qatar to secure a deal for providing the medicines needed.On Tuesday Mr Netanyahu issued a statement expressing "his appreciation to all those who have assisted in the endeavour".The Hamas attacks in October triggered Israel's intense bombardment of Gaza, which has killed more than 24,000 people so far, most of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Palestinian officials say that 85% of Gaza's population has been displaced. While more aid is now getting into Gaza the UN's humanitarian chief has described the situation as "intolerable".Israel is coming under increasing international pressure to consider a ceasefire or pause in Gaza, such is the scale of the civilian suffering.Even its closest ally the US, which consistently defends Israel's right to self defence, has repeatedly told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the civilian death toll is "far too high".Last week US State Secretary Anthony Blinken cited UN figures that 90% of the population continued to face severe food insecurity, adding: "For children, the effects of long periods without sufficient food can have lifelong consequences.""More food, more water, more medicine, other essential goods need to get into Gaza."	
16/01/2024 21:04:00	Ben & Jerry's board calls for Israel ceasefire - BBC News	The ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's has called for a "permanent and immediate ceasefire" in Gaza, jumping into the heated debates over the conflict. The move is in keeping with the brand, which previously tried to stop sales in West Bank and East Jerusalem, provoking a clash with owner Unilever.It comes as global boycotts have hit major US firms such as Starbucks over their perceived support of Israel. The Ben & Jerry's board said the firm stood up for peace."Promoting peace has been an integral part of Ben & Jerry's DNA for four decades," said Anuradha Mittal, the head of the board, who also runs the left-leaning think tank the Oakland Institute. "Today, Ben & Jerry's Board stands steadfast with that principle by calling for peace and a permanent and immediate ceasefire."There have been heated debates in the US and elsewhere over how firms and institutions should respond to the brutal attack on Israelis by Hamas on 7 October, and the response by Israel's military in Gaza. McDonald's and Starbucks have blamed backlash against their brands on misinformation on social media.  Even internal communications have often been fraught.While many US firms were quick to condemn the Hamas brutality, they have been quieter as the conflict continues.Unilever declined to comment on Tuesday. A spokesperson for Ben & Jerry's said the statement calling for a ceasefire was made on behalf of its independent board and it had no additional comment. "Ben & Jerry's has a long history of supporting peace and peace building," the spokesperson added.    "It is stunning that millions are marching around the world but the corporate world has been silent," Ms Mittal told the FT, which first reported the comments.Ben & Jerry's is known for its political activism.In 2000, when it was purchased by manufacturing giant Unilever, it preserved its right to have an independent board to guide its social mission.It has often taken stances aligned with the left on issues like LGBTQ+ rights and climate change.In 2021, before the current flare-up in violence, Ben & Jerry's had already provoked one row when it spoke up about the treatment of Palestinians.It said it no longer wanted its ice cream to be sold in parts of Palestine illegally occupied by Israelis including the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The stance prompted warnings from the Israeli government and led the prominent Jewish organisation, the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, to respond with calls for a boycott of "anti-semitic ice cream".Politicians in some US states, including most recently North Carolina, also moved to withdraw state pensions and other money from Unilever over the issue. Over the objections of Ben & Jerry's, Unilever eventually sold the Israeli branch to a local operator with a settlement that allowed sales to continue under different branding. Ms Mittal shared her personal views on the conflict in Gaza in December, criticising Israel's action in Gaza. It prompted the Simon Wiesenthal Centre to take to social media again criticising Ben & Jerry's. The post, which the Wall Street Journal reported was deleted after the newspaper asked about it, was controversial as it carried a picture of Ms Mittal and provoked online abuse directed at her personally. Activist investor Nelson Peltz, a board member at Unilever, later resigned from his position at the centre. 	
16/01/2024 18:33:00	Palestinian envoy Husam Zomlot says UK guilty of hypocrisy - BBC News	The Palestinians' top envoy to the UK has accused the government of "double standards and hypocrisy" in its policies towards them.Husam Zomlot criticised PM Rishi Sunak for opposing an application at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide in the war in Gaza.The UK had suffered "reputational damage" in the Middle East, he said.But he welcomed a recent decision by the government to ban violent Israeli settlers from entering the UK.Last month, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on X that settlers responsible for attacks on Palestinians would be barred. The move followed the announcement of a similar plan by the US."[This is] welcomed," said Mr Zomlot. "In my opinion that was a very significant moment - not because of the policy itself but because this is the first time in 75 years the UK takes any step that has to do with sanctions [on Israel]."There has been a reported rise in violence by settlers in recent months, especially since the mass Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October and the Israeli military campaign in Gaza which followed. There are about 700,000 Jewish settlers who live in some 140 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war and claimed by Palestinians for a future state. The settlements are considered illegal by most of the international community, though Israel disputes this.However, Mr Zomlot condemned a government bill banning public bodies from boycotting economic activity with Israel or Israeli settlements. The bill passed its third and final reading in the House of Commons last Wednesday and will now go to the House of Lords."This is the inconsistency," Mr Zomlot said at a news conference in London. "Where are you [the UK] exactly? Do you consider Israel's occupation of the 1967 borders to be a military occupation and colonisation? "There is such inconsistency in the UK policy that I... no longer understand if you ask me 'What is the UK policy vis-a-vis Palestine?' I don't know. Inconsistent, contradictory."Mr Zomlot, who is the Head of the Palestinian Mission to the UK, also rebuked Prime Minister Sunak for rejecting South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) accusing Israel of genocide.The ICJ began hearing the case at the end of last week. A spokesperson for the prime minister said Mr Sunak believed the allegation was "completely unjustified and wrong"."The UK government stands by Israel's clear right to defend itself within the framework of international law," the spokesperson said.The UK's opposition to South Africa's genocide allegation, said Mr Zomlot, was "a self-appointment as international judges, it's intervention and interference in the international judicial system".The UK, he said, was guilty of "double standards" and "hypocrisy" in its approach to Israel and international law.The envoy accused Israel of an "unprecedented manmade humanitarian disaster" in Gaza, and called on the international community to demand a ceasefire."Nothing comes before an immediate ceasefire," he said. "This remains our top, top priority."About 24,000 people have been killed in Israel's bombardment of Gaza - most of them women and children - since 7 October, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel launched its war with the declared aim of destroying Hamas after the group killed 1,300 people, mostly civilians, and took some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages in its attack on Israel. 	
16/01/2024 17:35:00	Mother of killed Israeli calls Hamas videos 'psychological warfare' - BBC News	The mother of an Israeli hostage accidentally killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza has described hostage videos released by Hamas as "psychological warfare". Iris Haim told BBC News that recent videos of hostages who appeared to be dead were intended to turn Israelis against their government to "try and make us weak".A video released by Hamas on 15 January appears to show the bodies of two hostages, Yossi Sharabi and Itay Svirsky. On Tuesday evening, the death of both men was confirmed in a statement from Kibbutz Be'eri and the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum. It said their bodies were still being held by Hamas, and requested their return.Yossi Sharabi's brother Eli was also kidnapped on October 7 and is still being held hostage. Eli's British-Israeli wife, Lianne, and daughters, Noiya and Yahel Sharabi, were murdered by Hamas.Itai Svirsky's parents, who he was visiting at the kibbutz, were both murdered in the attack.Hamas said the two had been killed by air strikes. But in the deaths of other hostages which the group has blamed on air strikes, Israeli forensic officials say post-mortems on the bodies do not support this.The video was narrated by a third hostage, Noa Argamani. Her fate is not known.Mrs Haim's own son Yotam was killed along with two other Israeli captives, Alon Shamriz and Samer Talalka on 15 December. All three were captured by Hamas gunmen during the group's attack on Israel on 7 October, which killed around 1,300 people, mostly civilians. Over 24,000 Gazans have also been killed - most of them women and children - in the Israeli bombardment since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel says more than 9,000 of those it has killed were Hamas fighters.Yotam and the other two men are believed to have escaped into an empty building close to Israeli army positions. An official investigation found that the men had used food to write the words "SOS" and "Help, 3 Hostages" on a sheet to try and alert soldiers to their presence."He and his friends were leaving captivity," Mrs Haim says with pride.Israeli soldiers suspected a Hamas trap and did not enter. Later, the hostages exited the building, shirtless and waving a makeshift white flag. But an Israeli sniper opened fire on them. Yotam was wounded, the other two men killed on the spot.According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), a command was given to hold fire and Yotam was told to come forward. But one of the soldiers shot nonetheless, killing him. According to the official investigation, the soldier didn't hear the order because of noise from a tank."We were really sorry and disappointed, of course, because just a week before [his death] we had heard that he was okay." Days after, Iris Haim recorded a message to the soldiers who killed her son, telling them she did not see his death as their fault. Speaking through tears, she explains her decision. "What happened, happened … we have enough suffering here," she said. "These soldiers also have families and mothers. I was also worried for them.""We felt that we cannot be angry, because they were Israeli forces," she added.She is clear about who she blames for her son's death: "Hamas, just Hamas. Hamas is in charge of all of this."Her reaction contrasts with that of Alon Shamriz's family. At his funeral, his brother Ido blamed the Israeli government for his kidnapping and death, saying: "The one who abandoned you also murdered you."When I last met Mrs Haim in November, she was in London to raise the plight of the hostages with the international community. She told me then she still had hope that her son would return alive.Yotam and the two other slain hostages were held with Wichian Temthong, a Thai migrant worker. Mr Temthong, who was released as part of a separate deal with Hamas, has recalled how Yotam, a drummer for a heavy metal band named Persephore, would tap out rhythms with his hands to distract himself. His mother takes comfort from this. "He was a keeping his spirits high, even in a dark place like Hamas captivity. He survived for 70 days in very hard conditions," she says. Yotam's brother is also a drummer, playing in the band of Israeli singer Netta Barzilai, the winner of the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest. At Yotam's funeral, she sang a Metallica song.Around 130 of the estimated 240 people taken to Gaza from Israel are believed to still be held by the group, after around half were released in November. Mrs Haim believes that "time is running out" for the remaining hostages, even if "Israel is doing its best to free" them.She expresses worry for them. "There is no food [for the hostages] in Gaza now, that's what I understand. Many old people don't get medicine. We don't know who is alive."For Yotam, it is too late. But she would like the world to know that in her eyes, he died a hero."He ended his life a free person."	
16/01/2024 12:45:00	US condemns Iran for 'reckless' missile strikes on northern Iraq - BBC News	The US has condemned Iran over ballistic missile strikes on Iraq's northern city of Irbil on Monday night, calling them "reckless and imprecise".Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they struck what they claimed were an Israeli "spy headquarters" in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region.Four civilians were killed and six hurt in the attack, local authorities said.Iraq recalled its ambassador from Tehran, condemning the strikes as a "blatant violation" of sovereignty. There has been no comment from Israel. The Revolutionary Guards also said they carried out missile strikes on "terrorist bases" in Syria in response to a recent suicide bombing in Iran claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group.In a separate development on Tuesday morning, Kurdish counter-terrorism forces said they had shot three armed drones flying over Irbil's airport, where US and international forces are stationed, Reuters news agency reported. There was no immediate claim, but an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has said it was behind similar attacks.The Iranian strikes come amid heightened tensions across the Middle East since the war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and the Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas began on 7 October.Iran has declared that it does not want to get involved in a wider conflict, but groups in its so-called "Axis of Resistance" have been carrying out attacks on Israel and its allies to show solidarity with the Palestinians.Lebanon's Hezbollah movement has exchanged cross-border fire with Israeli forces; Shia militias have launched drones and missiles at US forces in Iraq and Syria; and Yemen's Houthi rebels have attacked ships in the Red Sea.Israel has reportedly carried out strikes that killed a Hamas leader in Lebanon and a Revolutionary Guards commander in Syria, while the US has killed an Iraqi militia leader in an air strike in Iraq and bombed Houthi targets in Yemen.The Kurdistan Region Security Council said multiple ballistic missiles launched by the Revolutionary Guards struck civilian-populated areas of Irbil around 23:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Monday. Local news outlet Rudaw reported that loud explosions shook the city and that several residential buildings on the road between Irbil and the north-eastern suburb of Pirmam were damaged heavily. Peshraw Dizayee, a multimillionaire real estate magnate, was killed when a missile hit his home, the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party said.An 11-month-old baby was also among the dead, according to Rudaw.The Revolutionary Guards said in a statement that the missile strikes were a "response to the recent evil acts of the Zionist regime in martyring [Revolutionary Guards] and resistance commanders".The missiles "destroyed one of the main headquarters of Israel's spy agency Mossad in Iraq's Kurdistan Region", which had been used to "develop espionage operations and plan acts of terrorism", they claimed.However, the Kurdistan Region Security Council said it categorically rejected "this unfounded pretext" and accused the Revolutionary Guards of frequently employing "baseless pretexts for assaulting Irbil" when it posed no threat.The Kurdistan Region's Prime Minister, Masrour Barzani, condemned the "cowardly attack" and urged the federal government in Baghdad to "to take a principled position against the flagrant violation of Iraq's and the Kurdistan Region's sovereignty".The Iraqi foreign ministry said the government "strongly denounced the Iranian aggression on Irbil" and would "take all legal measures against it", including filing a complaint to the UN Security Council. It also announced the formation of an investigative committee to "prove the falsity" of Iran's claims.Later, the ministry recalled the Iraqi ambassador from Tehran for consultations and summoned Iran's charge d'affaires in Baghdad to protest."We will continue to assess the situation, but initial indications are that this was a reckless and imprecise set of strikes," Adrienne Watson, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, said in a statement."The United States supports the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Iraq," she said, adding that no US personnel or facilities were targeted.The UN mission in Iraq said: "Attacks, by any side, violating Iraqi sovereignty and territorial integrity must stop. Security concerns must be addressed through dialogue, not strikes."The Iranian foreign ministry said it respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries but was using its "legitimate and legal right to deter national security threats".In 2022, the Revolutionary Guards carried out a similar missile attack on what it claimed was an Israeli "strategic centre" in Irbil following an air strike in Syria that killed two senior Iranian officers. Later in the year, they hit what they said were the bases of Iranian Kurdish opposition groups in the region. The Revolutionary Guards also said they had targeted the positions of IS and other "terrorist groups" in Syria's opposition-controlled Idlib province on Monday night. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said it was not clear where the missiles landed. Four explosions were heard south-east of the city of Aleppo, within areas controlled by Iran-backed militias, and one blast was heard near the city of Idlib, it added.White Helmets first responders said a non-functioning medical clinic in the village of Taltita in Idlib province had been destroyed by explosions of unknown origin. Two people suffered minor injuries, they added. The Revolutionary Guards said the strikes in Syria were in retaliation for this month's suicide bombing that targeted crowds marking the fourth anniversary of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani's assassination by the US.That attack in Kerman in southern Iran killed at least 94 people.	
16/01/2024 12:36:00	Coventry United raise hundreds for Syrian footballer with broken leg - BBC News	A club has raised hundreds of pounds to help a talented 18-year-old Syrian footballer who broke his leg in five places during a match.Omer Ali was injured on Saturday while playing for Coventry United's U18 Midland Junior Premier League team in Staffordshire.The player, who has no other family in the UK, had just scored an equaliser when he collided with the Eccleshall Juniors goalkeeper, club co-owner Nigel Ward said."He’s had a really tough life," Mr Ward added."We want to support him because he’s our footballer."Mr Ward explained the player lives in a shared home in Coventry, where he is also studying at college, and has been in the UK for two years.He is being treated at Royal Stoke University Hospital, where the club owner visited him at the weekend."He's in a hell of a lot of pain," Mr Ward said.

16/01/2024 01:25:00	Houthi missile hits US-owned container ship in Gulf of Aden - BBC News	Houthi rebels have hit a US-owned cargo ship with a ballistic missile off the coast of Yemen, the US says.The vessel, Gibraltar Eagle, reported "no injuries or significant damage", according to the United States military command for the Middle East (Centcom).The Marshall Islands-flagged vessel is continuing on its journey in the Gulf of Aden. Iranian-backed Houthis have been attacking ships since November, in protest at Israel's war against Hamas.Shipping company Eagle Bulk Shipping said the bulk carrier was carrying steel products and was about 160km (100 miles) offshore in the Gulf of Aden when it was hit. It said the vessel "suffered limited damage to a cargo hold but is stable and is heading out of the area". Hours earlier Centcom said that another missile, fired in the direction of a US destroyer in the Red Sea, had been intercepted and shot down by a US fighter jet.The Houthis have been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea that the group says are linked to Israel, or bound for Israeli ports. It says the attacks are a show of support for the Palestinians and Hamas in Gaza, as Israel continues its military campaign there.The British maritime security firm, Ambrey, says the Gibraltar Eagle was "assessed to not be Israel-affiliated". But a senior Houthi official said on Monday that American vessels were also considered targets. "It is enough for ships to be American for us to target them", Nasr al-Din Amer said.The Houthi attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea have led many of the world's biggest shipping companies to change course, thus causing major disruption to global commerce.In reaction to Monday's strike, the US Department of Transportation issued a maritime alert, recommending "that US flag and US-owned commercial vessels" remain clear of specified areas in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.On Monday, the world's second largest oil company, QatarEnergy, announced its decision to pause shipping via the route while it sought security advice.Last week, US and the UK forces struck Houthi targets in Yemen in retaliation for attacks on shipping. The joint forces, in coordination with allies, carried out dozens of air and sea strikes on Houthi missile launch sites and air defence systems inside Yemen.On Monday, the UK's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said 13 Houthi launch sites had been destroyed by its military action. Mr Sunak said that while he would not "speculate on future action", doing nothing would have weakened regional security.US intelligence assesses that the joint US-UK airstrikes on the Houthis' military facilities have destroyed about a quarter of their arsenal.But the Houthis' chief negotiator, Mohammed Abdulsalam told Reuters news agency that attacks on Israeli ships or those heading to Israeli ports would continue, in spite of the US-led airstrikes.Washington has blamed Iran for being behind the Houthi missile capability, which Tehran denies. Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said in a press conference on Monday that the West must stop the war against Yemen immediately.	
16/01/2024 00:33:00	Women and children who went to live with IS in Syria are being brought home - BBC News	"Welcome back to Kyrgyzstan," says Shukur Shermatov, addressing a class of 20 women. He is wearing a traditional felt cap, but there is nothing traditional about this school. It sits inside two rings of military security and the students are women who have been brought home from camps in Syria, where they ended up after living with the Islamic State group.The rehabilitation centre is woven into the mountains of northern Kyrgyzstan, and it is where wives and children of suspected IS recruits spend their first six weeks after being repatriated.Our BBC World Service team are among the first visitors, and like the residents, everything we say and do is closely monitored by the state intelligence agency. The women listen to Shukur attentively as he takes them through their first lesson. The course covers citizenship, religious ethics, and anger management. Posters on the wall offer tips on how to control your emotions.As well as the re-education programme, the families receive medical treatment, psychological support, and - for the first time in years for many - sufficient food, water, and shelter.Some countries have balked at repatriating women such as these - women who say they followed husbands, fathers and brothers into a war zone unknowingly. What happened to them there - what they did, how much they knew - has been hidden in the wreckage of the so-called caliphate. Decisions on whether they are victim or perpetrator now have to be made by officials, potentially thousands of miles away. The Kyrgyz government has, at least for now, decided to treat them as the former - albeit, cautiously. Nine out of 10 are under police investigation.After the lesson, we are led into a simple dormitory with four single beds, where we meet a woman draped in a purple hijab. We are calling her Fatima, not her real name, for her safety. Through a small window, the snowy lakeside landscape could not look more different to the Syrian camp she has left behind."The main thing here is that it's calm. Everyone is so grateful for that. The children love it." She pauses and appreciates the silence. "The calm."Fatima followed her husband to Turkey in 2013 when he said he wanted to work there. The whole family went, including Fatima's two adult sons, her daughter and a grandchild. She says she only realised they were in Syria when she heard the roar of jet planes overhead and saw IS guards.We asked whether she really had no idea where they were going and, like many of the women we met, she insisted she was unaware and it was normal for a woman to follow her husband. Within days of their arrival in Syria, she had lost her husband and son. Her husband burned to death after a bomb hit his car, while her son was shot by a sniper. Shortly afterwards, her other son fell ill and died.Unable to leave, the women spent nearly six years under brutal IS rule in Iraq and Syria, where Fatima's daughter had more children. When IS fighters were driven out, Fatima, her daughter and four grandchildren ended up in al-Hol, Syria's largest detention camp for suspected IS fighters and their families. They spent four years there, desperate to come home."Women were sick and children were crying all the time. We were begging them to let us leave," she says. "We barely survived. When people from Kyrgyzstan came to collect the first group, everyone was in shock."In October, her daughter and grandchildren were told they were being repatriated, but not Fatima. "I cried when they told me I wasn't on the list. How wasn't I on the list? I'm their mother!" she sobs. "But now that I am here and will soon be back with my family, I am so happy. I'm glad my grandchildren can have an education. I want them to study science, to understand the world better."At 57, Fatima is the oldest person in the rehabilitation centre, one of 110 mothers and 229 children Kyrgyzstan brought back from Syria in 2023 as part of a new repatriation operation. Only Iraq repatriated more last year.  Kyrgyzstan plans to bring back at least another 260 women and children, after years of campaigning by relatives of people stuck in Syria. The aim is to give people the government believes may have been victims a second chance. Even so, the returnees are all interrogated and remain under regular surveillance after finishing the reintegration course. Nine in 10 are facing criminal investigations, the head of the Kyrgyz national security council told us. Potential charges could include assisting terrorism or transporting children to a war zone. As yet, however, no-one has been prosecuted.The continued surveillance, and potential of criminal proceedings, mean the women are often reluctant to talk about their time in Syria.After Elmira, who has passed through the rehabilitation centre and is now rebuilding her life in a town outside the capital, Bishkek, agrees to speak to us, we get a glimpse of what this monitoring looks like.Soon after we arranged to see her, we were phoned by her social worker, notifying us that she would be present at the interview too. When we arrived, two counter-terror police officers, whom the family recognised, were there as well. After some discussion, they agreed to wait outside.Elmira claims she was tricked into going to Syria by a man she met online. He convinced her to join him in Turkey and, thinking they would be happy together, four days after her 18th birthday she flew out to meet him.But when she got there, she was greeted by a different man who said he was his friend and took her on a 17-hour drive across the Syrian border. She claims that by the time she realised what was happening, it was too late to turn back. She married twice. Her first husband died after a couple of months, then she married a man from Dagestan and had his child. She won't say any more about what he was doing in Syria but explains they were looking for a way out before he died in a rocket attack. Elmira says the hardest moment was when she thought her daughter might be dead. She had gone out, leaving her little girl at home, when rockets hit their neighbourhood. Terrified for her child, Elmira ran home in tears. "Then someone brought her out, alive, healthy, and she was just afraid. The neighbour's house had been hit and other children who were nearby died."Like Fatima, Elmira and her daughter ended up in al-Hol camp.  "I still can't believe it. Sometimes I wake up at night and don't know if I'm dreaming," she tells us. "I'm so grateful to everyone who helped get us out of there and didn't abandon us. We know that not every country does that."Elmira, who is now training as a seamstress, asked us not to disclose her real name. After seeing the response to the repatriations from some Kyrgyz people on social media, she has decided not to tell anyone about her past."It isn't pleasant," she says. "A lot of us don't understand why they are afraid of us. We are afraid of them! People think we have come back here with machine guns and suicide belts. It's not like that. We are people just like they are. We also have families. We also have children. And we also want to lead peaceful and happy lives.""And why tell people, when I myself want to forget?" Elmira adds. "I was 18 then. I'm 27 now. I've learned not to be so naïve."Elmira's mother, Hamida Yusupova, spent the past decade pleading with the Kyrgyz authorities to bring back her daughter and granddaughter, and founded a campaign group for parents of girls who went to Syria."We know that Syria can be a one-way trip. You start to realise that your child might never make it back home," she says."I thank God, that she's back home and, finally, I've met my granddaughter. But Elmira has lost nine years of her youth. It's a long time."  When Hamida came to collect them from the rehabilitation centre, their reunion was filled with more tears than words."Elmira had become a mother. She understood how hard it is when you raise a child for 18 years and, one day, they tell you they're 'going to work', shut the door, and disappear to Syria. I wouldn't wish it on any mother," Hamida says."All Elmira could say was: 'Mum, forgive me, forgive me.' Nothing else. Apart from, then she told me how much I had aged!"Elmira and Hamida are well aware that not everyone around them will be forgiving.Like many of its central Asian neighbours, Kyrgyzstan - where 90% of the population identify as Muslim - was a major source of recruits for IS, a UN-designated terrorist group, during its rise to prominence.Hamida feels her daughter was a victim of manipulative men and guilty only of being gullible. However, we spoke to Kyrgyz women the same age as Elmira who said they felt anxious that the returnees could radicalise others, especially after seeing how the Taliban retook Afghanistan."As a mum, I've heard a lot of insults and slurs. I don't want my child to have to hear that. I don't want people to point fingers at my child and call her a terrorist," Hamida says.Deputy Prime Minister Edil Baisalov is keen to showcase the repatriation policy as proof that Kyrgyzstan is a tolerant democracy that looks after all of its citizens."I believe that the best thing is that they forget the nightmare they have been through, and that nobody in their families and communities remembers this situation. That everyone is just a good citizen of Kyrgyzstan," he tells us.Mr Baisalov knows this is a contentious subject, particularly in some Western countries. A former ambassador to the UK, he was in post shortly after Shamima Begum, one of three London schoolgirls who left to join IS, had her British citizenship revoked.The deputy prime minister also wanted to send a political message. Human rights groups have questioned Kyrgyzstan's reputation as an island of democracy in central Asia since disputed elections in 2020 and the introduction of new laws."For Kyrgyzstan, this was not an easy decision," he said. "Of course, our kind of Islam is not radical. It is a very tolerant Islam, respectful of other religions. We are a small nation that needs to take care of each other. Even of those who commit mistakes."The scheme is supported by the UN children's agency Unicef and Sylvi Hill, who lead their repatriation efforts in Kyrgyzstan, describes it as "commendable". She says Unicef is calling for "all governments to facilitate the return, rehabilitation and reintegration of their children affected by conflict".The women we spoke to say they are grateful to be offered this second chance, and they are well aware that there are nearly 50,000 others from around the world still trapped in camps in northern Syria, with no way out.	
15/01/2024 21:55:00	Israel Gaza war: Hamas video claims to show dead hostages - BBC News	Hamas has issued a new video purporting to show the bodies of two Israeli hostages, with the militants claiming that they died in air strikes on Gaza.It comes a day after Hamas released another video of the hostages when they were alive, but warning they could die if Israel continued its bombardment.Israel denied they were killed by strikes. Its defence minister accused the militants of "psychological abuse".He added that military pressure was essential to release more hostages.The video released on Monday shows a woman named as Noa Argamani, speaking under duress and saying that two men with whom she had been held had been killed in captivity.She says the men - one of whom was identified as Itay Svirsky, 38 - were killed by "our own IDF strikes", referring to the Israel Defense Forces.She added that they were buried under rubble after the strikes, but that Hamas fighters had "succeeded in saving my life". It was not clear when the video was taken.In response, IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the hostages had not been killed by Israeli forces. "This is a Hamas lie," he said in a statement. "The building where they were being held was not a target."Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: "Hamas is severely beaten by Israeli forces, what is left for them is to lash out at the sensitive nerves of the Israeli society through the psychological abuse of the (Israeli) family members."He also insisted that continued military pressure remained vital. "They only talk to us when they want something," Mr Gallant said. "The moment we give them ceasefire without a price, they won't talk to us."The video released by Hamas on Sunday showed Ms Argamani, 26, along with the two men when they were alive. It urges the Israeli government to stop its offensive and bring about their release.That footage ends with the caption: "Tomorrow (Monday) we will inform you of their fate."Ms Argamani, Mr Svirsky and the third hostage mentioned in the videos were among 240 people taken by militants in a series of Hamas raids in southern Israel on 7 October.About 1,300 people, mainly civilians, were also killed in those attacks. About 132 hostages are still being held in Gaza. The raids triggered Israel's intense bombardment of Gaza, which have killed more than 24,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Palestinian officials say that 85% of Gaza's population has been displaced. While more aid is now getting into Gaza the UN's humanitarian chief has described the situation as "intolerable".Israeli forces continued to bomb targets across the Gaza Strip on Monday, and clashed with militants in southern and central areas.Mr Gallant said that the intensive phase of operations against Hamas would soon come to an end in southern Gaza.	
15/01/2024 20:43:00	Iran sentences Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi to additional prison term - BBC News	Iran's Revolutionary Court has sentenced Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi to an additional 15 months in prison.Ms Mohammadi has already spent 12 years in jail serving multiple sentences.She is accused of spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic while in prison.Her family condemned the verdict, saying this was her fifth conviction since March 2021. She was not present at the latest trial and the verdict was issued in her absence. Narges Mohammadi has campaigned for human rights in Iran for decades. She has been in and out of jail for two decades because of her activism. She has been arrested 13 times and sentenced to a total of 31 years in prison.As well as the additional months in prison, the new sentence orders Ms Mohammadi to spend two years in exile outside Tehran. This means she will have to be moved from the notorious Evin prison where she is currently held.The verdict also said that after serving her time, Ms Mohammadi would be banned from traveling abroad for two years and would be barred from membership of political and social groups and from having a mobile phone for the same duration.The 51-year-old human rights activist has kept up her work despite the numerous threats and arrests.She won the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her work fighting against the oppression of women in Iran.Her teenage children accepted the prize, at Oslo's city hall, last month, on her behalf, having not seen their mother for years.The children read a speech which had been smuggled out of prison, where Ms Mohammadi denounced Iran's "tyrannical" government."I write this message from behind the high, cold walls of a prison. The Iranian people, with perseverance, will overcome repression and authoritarianism," she said.Referring to the protests that began last year following the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody for allegedly wearing her hijab "improperly", Ms Mohammadi said young Iranians had "transformed the streets and public spaces into a place of widespread civil resistance".	
15/01/2024 19:31:00	Israel: Woman killed, 17 hurt in suspected Palestinian car-ramming attack - BBC News	A 70-year-old woman has been killed and 17 other people injured in what police say was a terrorist attack in Israel.Two Palestinians from the occupied West Bank have been arrested over the incident in Raanana, about 20km (12.5 miles) north of Tel Aviv.The suspects allegedly switched between three stolen vehicles and ran over pedestrians in different places.The attack came as the war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza passed the 100-day mark.Israeli media reports say the woman who died was stabbed by one of the suspects before he and an accomplice took her car and used it to ram into people. The attackers lost control of the car then stole a second car and continued driving into people, according to the reports.Haaretz newspaper quoted an eyewitness as saying they "saw someone stab three people near the mall. [The attacker] stole a car and ran over other people".It is unclear how the attackers were stopped and arrested. Police say both suspects came from the West Bank city of Hebron and that they had both entered Israel illegally.There have been few reports of attacks in Israel since the war began on 7 October and Monday's incident will further increase the sense of anxiety among Israelis.The country is still in a state of shock after waves of Hamas gunmen burst through the border from Gaza and attacked Israeli communities, killing at least 1,300 people - mainly civilians - and taking about 240 others hostage 101 days ago.Tensions have also been heightened in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza. Local health officials say more than 350 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in raids targeting militants and in other incidents, as well as in settler-related violence.The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, reported that two Palestinians - 22-year-old Mohammed Hassan Abu Sabaa and Ahed Mahmoud Mohammed, 23 - were shot dead by Israeli forces during what it called "confrontations" in the town of Dura, south of Hebron, on Thursday night. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its forces had been attacked with petrol bombs and rocks, and had "responded with riot dispersal means and live fire"."An assailant who hurled a Molotov cocktail at the forces was killed, and additional hits were identified," it said.Hamas praised the attack in Raanana as "a natural response to the occupation's massacres and its continued aggression against our Palestinian people".The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 24,100 people - mainly women and children - have been killed in Israel's bombardment, which began in response to the attacks. The ministry says almost 61,000 others have been injured.Israel says 9,000 of those killed in Gaza were Hamas combatants. It has vowed to destroy the group and free the remaining hostages.	
15/01/2024 18:38:00	Rishi Sunak: Strikes on Houthis intended as 'limited, single action' - BBC News	Joint US-UK strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen were intended as a "limited, single action", Rishi Sunak has said. Following reports of more attacks by the rebel group on ships in the Red Sea on Monday, the prime minister refused to speculate whether he would take further military action in response. But he said the UK "will not hesitate to protect our security, our people and our interests where required".Labour said it backed the "targeted action". However, leader Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons military action must be "underpinned by a clear strategy".He added that the strikes still carried risks and "we must avoid escalation across the Middle East". The Houthis - a military and political group who control the north of Yemen and its capital Sanaa - have been attacking cargo ships in the Red Sea since November. Last Thursday, the US and UK carried out air strikes on military Houthi targets in response. Giving a Commons statement, Mr Sunak told MPs the government's "initial assessment" was that all 13 planned targets were destroyed, while there was no evidence of civilian casualties so far. He said the "proportionate" action was taken "in self-defence" and was "limited, not escalatory". His statement came shortly after American officials said the Houthis had hit a US-owned ship off the coast of Yemen with a missile. Earlier, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations security agency also reported that missile fire had struck a ship near Yemen's southern port city of Aden.Asked whether he would take more military action if necessary, Mr Sunak said: "I won't speculate on future action. "This was intended as limited, single action and we hope the Houthis will now step back and end their destabilising attacks. "But of course... we will not hesitate to protect our security, our people and our interests where required."The Houthi attacks have led major shipping companies to divert vessels away from the Red Sea, instead taking a longer route around southern Africa.Mr Sunak said this "pushes up prices, and imperils the passage of goods, foods and medicines that the British people and others rely on".He added that there were also risks from not acting, which he said "would weaken international security and the rule of law, further damage freedom of navigation and the global economy, and send a dangerous message that British vessels and British interests are fair game". The Houthis - who are allies of Iran - have said they are attacking ships affiliated with Israel in protest at the war in Gaza. However, commercial vessels with no connection to the country also appear to have been targeted.Mr Sunak said the UK-US strikes were "completely unrelated" to the Israel-Gaza conflict and were "a direct response to the Houthis' attacks on international shipping". He added that the group were targeting ships from around the world and "we shouldn't fall for their malign narrative". The Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Plaid Cymru had argued the government should hold a vote on the strikes.The government is not legally required to seek parliamentary approval before taking military action. However, a convention has been established in recent years under which the Commons is - in most circumstances - given the opportunity to debate the deployment of military forces in advance.SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn called on the PM to reveal his long-term strategy if the Houthi attacks continued, adding: "We cannot have an escalation which leads to further regional instability."Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said his party supported "limited" strikes against the Houthis but it was "regrettable" there was no vote on the action.He urged Mr Sunak to ensure the strikes remained "limited", describing the region as "a tinderbox". Defending the decision not to consult Parliament before the action, Mr Sunak said it was "necessary to strike at speed... to protect the security of these operations".However, the prime minister added that he had addressed MPs on the issue "at the earliest opportunity". The Houthis, who control most of the populated parts of Yemen, now have three options.They can back down, having made their point, raised their regional profile and increased their popularity at home.Their actions to date show no sign of them doing this.They can continue to harass military and commercial shipping off their coasts, which they appear to be now doing.Or - and this is the option the West should worry about - they could marshal their remaining missiles and drones and wait for the opportunity to launch a mass attack on a US or British warship, in the hopes of overwhelming its air defences. This is something the Houthi spokesman has already hinted at and it remains a real risk.US intelligence assesses that the recent airstrikes on the Houthis' military facilities have destroyed or degraded around a quarter of their arsenal.Further airstrikes will degrade that further so the Houthis will need to make some careful calculations as to how far they take this beyond their fiery rhetoric about retaliation.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.	
15/01/2024 17:58:00	Sagiv Jehezkel: Israel footballer leaves Turkey after hostage plea row - BBC News	An Israeli footballer at the centre of a row over a gesture of solidarity with hostages in Gaza he made during a match in Turkey has returned to Israel.After Sunday's match Sagiv Jehezkel was briefly detained in the southern city of Antalya and accused of incitement.It is unclear whether he faces prosecution if he returns to Turkey. His club, Antalyaspor, has sacked him.Jehezkel's arrest prompted a bitter war of words between the Israeli and Turkish governments.The 28-year-old player, who signed for Antalyaspor in September, was celebrating an equaliser in a Turkish Super Lig match when he held up his bandaged hand that read "100 days. 7/10". The bandage also included a star of David.Sunday marked 100 days since Hamas launched its deadly attacks on southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mainly civilians. About 240 people were taken back to Gaza as hostages, approximately 132 of whom are still being held. The attack triggered Israel's bombardment of Gaza, killing more than 23,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.After Sunday's incident, Turkey's Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said an investigation had been launched into the player's "ugly action supporting Israel's massacre in Gaza". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long been a staunch supporter of the Palestinians, including Hamas, and has been highly critical of Israel's conduct in Gaza. The country has also seen large pro-Palestinian rallies since 7 October.Mr Erdogan's chief adviser called the player "Israel's vile dog in a footballers clothing".According to local media, Jehezkel gave a statement through a translator saying he did not "make a move to provoke", but wanted the war to end. "I am not a pro-war person… There are Israeli soldiers captured in Gaza. I am someone who believes that this 100-day period should end now. I want the war to end," he said. Israeli officials have criticised Turkey's actions towards the footballer.Defence Minister Yadav Gallant said Israel had supported Turkey in last year's earthquakes, and accused Turkey of serving as a "de facto executive arm" of Hamas, The Turkish Football Federation described Jehezkel's actions as "unacceptable", and said the decision by Antalyaspor to exclude him from the squad was "appropriate". 	
15/01/2024 14:00:00	Iran judiciary files new hijab case against released journalists - BBC News	Iran's judiciary says it has opened a new case against two female journalists for appearing without the compulsory hijab upon their release from prison.Niloufar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammadi were pictured with their hair uncovered after 17 months in detention.They helped break the story of Mahsa Amini's death in 2022, which sparked mass protests against the hijab laws.In October, they were jailed for seven and six years respectively on national security charges, which they denied.Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemned their trials as a sham, saying their lawyers were notified of hearings at the last minute, given only a few hours to examine case files, and not allowed to address the judge.A court approved the women's release on bail of 10bn tomans ($193,000 at the open market rate) on Sunday while they appealed against the sentences.The decision was celebrated by the newspapers which employ Ms Hamedi and Ms Mohammadi, and many Iranians online, with many sharing pictures of them outside Tehran's Evin prison.Iranian media reported in August that authorities had questioned or arrested more than 90 journalists since protests erupted in response to the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was detained by morality police in September 2022 for allegedly wearing her hijab "improperly". Ms Hamedi, a journalist with the Sharq newspaper, photographed Mahsa Amini's father and grandmother hugging each other in hospital after learning that she had died after three days in a coma. She posted it on Twitter with the caption: "The black dress of mourning has become our national flag."Ms Mohammadi, a reporter with the Hammihan newspaper, published a story about Ms Amini's funeral in her hometown of Saqqez. She described how hundreds of mourners cried out "Woman, life, freedom", which became one of the main slogans of the protests.They were arrested weeks later and subsequently accused of "collaborating with the hostile US government" and "propaganda against the establishment". They rejected the charges, insisting that they were just doing their jobs.	
15/01/2024 13:32:00	Gaza Strip in maps: How life has changed in three months - BBC News	Almost two million people in Gaza - more than 85% of the population - are reported to have fled their homes in the three months since Israel began its military operation in response to Hamas's deadly attacks of 7 October.The Strip has been under the control of Hamas since 2007 and Israel says it is trying to destroy the military and governing capabilities of the Islamist group, which is committed to the destruction of Israel.Gaza - a densely populated enclave 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, bounded by the Mediterranean Sea on one side and fenced off from Israel and Egypt at its borders - has "simply become uninhabitable", according to a senior United Nations official.Israel warned civilians to evacuate the area of Gaza north of the Wadi Gaza riverbed, ahead of its invasion.The evacuation area included Gaza City - which was the most densely populated area of the Gaza Strip. The Erez border crossing into Israel in the north is closed, so those living in the evacuation zone had no choice but to head towards the southern districts.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are now focusing operations on southern Gaza. The main urban areas in the south - Khan Younis and Rafah - have been bombed and Israeli troops have clashed with Hamas fighters on the ground. Palestinians, including those who have fled fighting in the north, had been told to move to a so-called "safe area" at al-Mawasi, a thin strip of mainly agricultural land along the Mediterranean coast, close to the Egyptian border. But the Israeli military has said it is now also preparing to operate in parts of al-Mawasi and residents should move to Deir al Balah.Fighting in Khan Younis and Deir al Balah has already pushed tens of thousands of people to flee to the southern district of Rafah, the UN said, where more than one million people "are squeezed into an extremely overcrowded space".According to the UN, just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - were already registered refugees before Israel warned Palestinians to leave northern Gaza.Palestinian refugees are defined by the UN as people whose "place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 War". The children of Palestinian refugees are also able to apply for refugee status.More than 500,000 of those refugees were already in eight crowded camps located across the Strip.Following Israel's warnings, the number of displaced people has risen rapidly and 1.9 million have fled their homes since 7 October, the UN says.On average, before the conflict, there were more than 5,700 people per sq km in Gaza - very similar to the average density in London - but that figure was more than 9,000 in Gaza City, the most heavily populated area.As Gazans have fled south, the population density is now more than 12,000 people per square kilometre in Rafah, the UN says.The UN warns that overcrowding has become a major concern in its emergency shelters in central and southern Gaza, with some far exceeding their capacity.."Overcrowded and unsanitary UNRWA shelters have now become "home" to more than 1.4 million people," said UNRWA commissioner Philippe Lazzarini. "They lack everything, from food to hygiene to privacy.  People live in inhumane conditions, where diseases are spreading, including among children. They live through the unliveable, with the clock ticking fast towards famine."  Many of these emergency shelters are schools and in some there are dozens of people living in a single classroom. Other families are living in tents or makeshift shelters in compounds or on waste ground in open spaces.Israel has already launched hundreds of airstrikes across Gaza and says it has used more than 10,000 bombs and missiles, causing extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure.Gazan officials say more than 50% of housing units in Gaza have been destroyed, left uninhabitable or damaged since the start of the conflict. They say more than 500,000 people will have no homes to return to, and many more will be not be able to return immediately after the conflict because of damage to surrounding infrastructure.The map below - using analysis of satellite data by Corey Scher of CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University - shows which urban areas have sustained concentrated damage since the start of the conflict.They say at least 138,000 buildings across the whole Gaza Strip have suffered damage. North Gaza and Gaza City have borne the brunt of this, with at least 70% of buildings in the two northern regions believed to have been damaged, but their analysis now suggests up to 56% of buildings in Khan Younis have also been damaged.Many healthcare facilities have been left unable to function as a result of bomb damage or lack of fuel.The UN says hospital capacity in the enclave has more than halved from 3,500 beds before 7 October to about 1,000 now - and "hardly any" in the north.More than 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed during the Hamas attacks on 7 October. More than 23,000 Palestinians - including about 8,000 children - have been killed in Israeli airstrikes and operations since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. It is difficult for the BBC to verify exact numbers, but the UN's World Health Organization (WHO) has said it has no reason to believe the figures are inaccurate.The airstrikes were accompanied by a "complete siege" of Gaza by Israel, with electricity, food and fuel supplies cut, followed by military action on the ground.The IDF began its ground operations by moving into Gaza from the north-west along the coast and into the north east near Beit Hanoun. A few days later Israeli forces cut across the middle of the territory to the south of Gaza City. Armoured bulldozers created routes for tanks and troops, as the Israeli forces tried to clear the area of Hamas fighters based in northern Gaza.Having cut Gaza in two, the Israelis pushed further into Gaza City, where they faced resistance from Hamas. While there are still clashes in some areas, analysts from the Institute for the Study of War say Israeli forces have started to secure parts of northern Gaza.The image below, released by the IDF, shows tanks and armoured bulldozers on the beach near Gaza City. A photo of the same beach from last summer shows people making the most of a hot day in Gaza, families splashing in the sea or sitting on fanning out along the beach. Even before the current conflict, about 80% of the population of Gaza was in need of humanitarian aid, and although Israel has been allowing some aid in from Egypt, aid agencies said it was nowhere near enough.The World Food Programme says half of Gaza's population is starving and 90% of the population regularly go without food for a whole day. A seven-day ceasefire at the end of November allowed agencies to deliver an average of 170 trucks and 110,000 litres of fuel a day, the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says.Aid trucks are still crossing into Gaza, but the WHO has warned that delivering that aid "continues to face near insurmountable challenges" as the area endures intense bombardment, movement restrictions, interrupted communications and fuel shortages.Are you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

15/01/2024 13:22:00	We will not hesitate to act against Houthi targets, says Rishi Sunak - BBC News	Rishi Sunak has said his government "will not hesitate to protect our security", following joint US-UK strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.He said the action aimed to send "a strong message" to the Houthi group that attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea were "unacceptable".This is the first time Mr Sunak has committed the UK to new military action since becoming PM in October 2022.On Monday afternoon, he will take questions from MPs about the strikes.Speaking to reporters, Mr Sunak defended the action, saying it had been the "last resort" following "exhaustive diplomatic activity".He said the Houthis - a military and political group who control the north of Yemen and its capital Sanaa - needed to "recognise the international condemnation for what they are doing and desist".Last Thursday, the US and UK carried out air strikes on military Houthi targets aimed at undermining their ability to attack cargo ships.The Iran-backed group have said they are attacking ships affiliated with Israel in protest at the conflict in Gaza, however commercial vessels with no connection to the country also appear to have been targeted.  The attacks have led major shipping companies to divert vessels away from the Red Sea, instead taking a longer route around southern Africa.Speaking to the Reuters news agency, Houthi chief negotiator Mohammed Abdulsalam said the US-UK strikes had not change their position and that attacks on ships would continue. Asked if there would be further attacks on the Houthis, Mr Sunak said: "We will not hesitate to ensure the security and safety of British people our interests and our assets."Earlier, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC the government would "look again" at further strikes if attacks on vessels in the Red Sea did not stop.He added that the UK had "no interest in entering some extended approach in the Red Sea". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he backed the strikes but added that MPs in Parliament "now need to hear the scope, the basis, the full reasoning behind the decision"."If the government is proposing further action, then it should say so and set out the case, and we're going to have to consider that on a case-by-case basis on the merits."Last week, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Plaid Cymru argued the government should hold a vote on the military action.Now, the Lib Dems have said they will table a bill stating that MPs should get a vote on the deployment of armed forces, with exemptions in cases of emergency. The party's defence spokesperson Richard Foord said: "Parliament must not be bypassed on an issue as important as military action."The government is not legally required to seek parliamentary approval before taking military action. However, a convention has been established in recent years under which the Commons is - in most circumstances - given the opportunity to debate the deployment of military forces in advance. Defending the government's decision not to consult MPs prior to the strikes, Mr Shapps said: "It would have provided perhaps too much information and detail to the Houthis."

15/01/2024 07:18:00	From Israel to Norfolk: The bowls brothers taking on the world's best - BBC News	Brothers David and Zvika Hadar travelled the world together when they were younger, before they had families of their own.Forty years on from spending time in Brazil and Jamaica, they decided to roll back the years and take off on another adventure.It was Amsterdam for New Year's Eve celebrations, but that was just a stop off on the way to the exotic surroundings of Potters Resort in Hopton-On-Sea, Norfolk.It is probably not a well trodden path, but they had a very good reason - they were the Israeli qualifiers for the Open Pairs at the World Indoor Bowls Championships.It was not to be on the famous blue rink as they lost their first round match in a tie-break against Scotland's Ronnie Duncan and Colin Walker.But David was pleased with his first experience on the big stage."I think it was a lot of fun," he said. "I'm very happy with the performance of us as a team even though we lost."I think the people are very nice, it's very special to be here - the food is great, the shows are great, all the staff are wonderful, this is a beautiful place."Qualifying for the World Championships is not easy - and the ongoing conflict between the Hadar brothers' home country Israel and Hamas provided more complications.David, 69, now retired, and Zvika, 65, who works in real estate, both live in the city of Ra'anana, around 6 miles (10km) north of Tel-Aviv.Zvika says it was a difficult decision to leave their homeland given the current situation."The atmosphere Israelis hear about the anti-Semitism in the world is a little bit intimidating," he said."However, both in Amsterdam and here, we encountered only support and sympathy from everybody so I'm surprised positively. "As far as making the decision to come here, it wasn't easy because for the last three months, we in Israel are mostly mourning the people that we know who either got hurt or lost."In November I didn't make the Scottish International, even though I qualified, because it was too close to the situation. It wasn't perfectly right to take a break from the bad atmosphere and go and have fun."But at the same time, I wanted to come here and show myself as Israeli on television and in person to show us also in a positive side, not only in the war that is going on and the two sides that are hurting."Getting to spend a week with my brother and try to crack a win against top bowlers in the world, it's been pure fun."Throughout the World Championships, seeded players Wayne Willgress and Mervyn King are among those who have said how difficult it is to judge the pace of the portable blue rink, and they live just down the road.So imagine the difficulty level for David and Zvika, given there are no indoor bowls venues in Israel. They are both members of Ra'Annana Bowls Club."Bowls in Israel is not as popular as it is here," Zvika says. "There's four clubs, with 400-500 members, playing on grass."We don't have indoor or artificial outdoors so we have to make a big adjustment when we come here."Fortunately, there were a couple of former World Champions on hand to give some help to David, who has only been playing a few years."As a first time international bowler, I practised with two legends, Greg Harlow and David Gourlay MBE," he said. "They both were very nice, they helped me, they gave me tips. I changed my bowls because of them."Zvika has been bowling for much longer than his older brother and has previous experience of bowling at the highest level, even beating the then reigning world champion Greg Harlow at the Welsh Open in 2010.He recalls his first times playing alongside the world's best."It was the same for me, especially in the first few years - they're always keen to help the up and coming, overseas players that don't have much experience on this blue portable rink which is not easy," he said."I've been bowling for 20 years and the event at Potters is probably the most exciting and fun - the people here in hospitality, the conditions for us as players, the fact that it's televised all over the world - we come here and have a blast."David and Zvika may have lost their match, but bowls has allowed them to reconnect for the first time in many years."We used to be very close when we were young, before we got married and each had our own families," Zvika says."So now two brothers going to travel together, it's been pure fun!"You can watch live coverage of the 2024 World Indoor Bowls Championships on the BBC Sport website.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

15/01/2024 19:00:00	Houthi missile hits US-owned ship off Yemen coast - BBC News		
15/01/2024 06:36:00	Yemen: US shoots down missile from Houthi-run area fired towards warship - BBC News	The US military says it has shot down a missile fired towards one of its warships from a Houthi area of Yemen.The anti-ship cruise missile - fired towards the USS Laboon in the Red Sea - was downed off the coast of Hudaydah by a US fighter aircraft.No injuries or damage were reported in the incident on Sunday afternoon.It comes after the US and UK launched strikes aimed at degrading the military capability of the Houthis, who have been attacking Red Sea cargo ships.The US and UK hit nearly 30 locations in Yemen on Friday, reportedly including arms depots, logistical hubs and air defence systems.The US followed up on Saturday with another strike on a Houthi radar site. President Joe Biden has said he would not "hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary". Similarly, the UK says it is prepared to launch further action against the Houthis.Prominent Houthi supporter Hussain Al-Bukhaiti told the BBC on Sunday that fighters would target US and UK battleships if strikes on Yemen continued.The Houthis are a political and military group in control of a large part of Yemen, including the capital. They are key allies of Hamas and are thought to receive weapons from Iran, Israel's arch-enemy.Since 19 November, they have carried out at least 27 attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea, a major route for global maritime trade. The group has said it was targeting vessels heading to, or owned by, Israel, as an act of solidarity with the people of Gaza. However, some of the ships they have hit have no clear connection to Israel.The attacks have led major shipping companies to divert vessels away from the Red Sea, instead taking a longer route around southern Africa.This has already had an impact on the global economy - with shipping giant Maersk telling the BBC it was being felt "down to the end consumer".Tesla and Volvo Cars have suspended some of their car production, UK grocery giant Tesco has warned some prices may go up and Ikea has said supplies could be affected.The Houthi attacks have been "causing major disruption to a vital trade route and driving up commodity prices", UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said.The attacks by the group, along with the UK-US strikes in Yemen, have added to fears that the war in Gaza is already spreading to the wider Middle East.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.

15/01/2024 02:17:00	First Prince of Persia game in 14 years voiced in Farsi - BBC News	The first new version of cult video game Prince of Persia in 14 years has been released, called The Lost Crown, and it is the first edition in the series to be fully voiced in Farsi. The franchise draws heavily on Persian mythology and Iranian culture, but until now has always been in English.The developers say they want to "depict and respect Persia and Iran".Game fan Sam Mandi-Gohmi said it was "brilliant" that representation was being taken more seriously."When I saw the tweet announcing Farsi would be a full game audio option for The Lost Crown, I half thought it was a joke," said Mr Mandi-Gohmi, who lives in the UK."I grew up in England to an Iranian father, and often when I was younger we'd play games together, as it wasn't something that was significant in his childhood."I rushed to show my dad it - he laughed and translated alongside in disbelief."Sam said previous games in the series, released in the UK in the 1990s and 2000s, did not have characters who "appeared fully Iranian"."Now, it's not 2003 any more and representation in media is a significant consideration for developers - that's brilliant - but there is still basically zero Iranian representation within Western media," he said.The game is the first in the series to be made by Ubisoft Montpellier, a subsidiary of Assassin's Creed developer Ubisoft."From the start, we wanted to be able to depict and to respect Persia and Iran," said the game's designer Mounir Radi."It was natural for us to say, if we are going into this culture, we have to be true to this culture, we have to do this."The makers also attempted to modernise the game - which is the first in the series since 2010's The Forgotten Sands, aside from spin-offs and remakes. The graphics - which draw inspiration from Sony's animated smash hit Into the Spider-Verse - have been updated.But another part of modernising the game involved making it authentic in a way the series never was before, for example by weaving elements of the Zoroastrianism religion - which was founded in present-day Iran - into the gameplay.The game's producer Abdelhak Elguess told the BBC they were "very proud" to have made the changes."We have so many people from Persian cultures that are very happy," he said.Emad Saedi has been a fan of the games since he was a child, when he connected with the series' cultural references to Persia, but says something always felt off."Those games were missing a fundamental element of the culture the prince came from: language," he said. "My friends and I always had this question that if he's a Persian prince, how come he speaks English, or any language except Persian? Isn't that odd?"Emad said it is a "huge step forward" to include the language, in part because he felt Iran and Persian culture are "under-represented in today's world"."In a world that is saturated with Western culture content, seeing something from other parts of the world feels like a breath of fresh air, especially from a hidden gem like Iran," he said. "It feels like we are finally being seen after being ignored for many years. "There are many wonderful stories in our culture with massive commercial potential - I hope the entertainment industry recognises this opportunity and continues to invest in them."	
15/01/2024 00:19:00	They were Israel's 'eyes on the border' - but their Hamas warnings went unheard - BBC News	They are known as Israel's eyes on the Gaza border.For years, units of young female conscripts had one job here. It was to sit in surveillance bases for hours, looking for signs of anything suspicious. In the months leading up to the 7 October attacks by Hamas, they did begin to see things: practice raids, mock hostage-taking, and farmers behaving strangely on the other side of the fence. Noa, not her real name, says they would pass information about what they were seeing to intelligence and higher-ranking officers, but were powerless to do more. "We were just the eyes," she says.It was clear to some of these women that Hamas was planning something big - that there was, in Noa's words, a "balloon that was going to burst".The BBC has now spoken to these young women about the escalation in suspicious activity they observed, the reports they filed, and what they saw as a lack of response from senior Israel Defense Forces (IDF) officers. We have also seen WhatsApp messages the women sent in the months before 7 October, talking about incidents at the border. To some of them it became a dark joke: who would be on duty when the inevitable attack came?These women were not the only ones raising the alarm, and as more testimony is gathered, anger at the Israeli state - and questions over its response - are mounting.The BBC has spoken also to the grieving families who have now lost their daughters, and to experts who see the IDF's response to these women as part of a broader intelligence failure. The IDF said it was "currently focused on eliminating the threat from the terrorist organisation Hamas" and declined to answer the BBC's questions."The problem is that they [the military] didn't connect the dots," a former commander at one of the border units tells the BBC. If they had, she says, they would have realised that Hamas was preparing something unprecedented.Shai Ashram, 19, was one of the women on duty on 7 October. In a call with her family, where they could hear gunshots ringing in the background, she said there were "terrorists in the base and that there was going to be a really big event".She was one of more than a dozen surveillance soldiers killed. Others were taken hostage.As Hamas attacked, the women at Nahal Oz, a base about a kilometre from the Gaza border, began to say goodbye to one another on their shared WhatsApp group.Noa, who was not on duty and was reading the messages from home, remembers thinking "this is it". The attack they had long feared was now actually happening.Because of the locations of their bases, the women of this military unit - known as tatzpitaniyot in Hebrew - were among the first Israelis that Hamas reached after rampaging out of Gaza.The women sit inside rooms close to the border, staring for hours every day at live surveillance footage captured by cameras along the high-tech fence, and balloons that hover over Gaza.There are several of these units next to the Gaza fence, and others at different positions along Israel's borders. They are all made up of young women, aged in their late teens to early 20s. They do not carry guns.In their free time, the young women would learn dance routines, cook dinners together, and watch TV programmes. For many, their time in the military was their first time living away from their families, and they describe forming sisterly bonds.But they say they took their responsibilities seriously. "Our job is to protect all residents. We have a very hard job - you sit on shift and you are not allowed to squint or move your eyes even a little. You must always be focused," Noa says.An article published by the IDF in late September lists the tatzpitaniyot alongside Israel's elite intelligence units as those that "know everything about the enemy".When the women see something suspicious they log it with their commander and on a computer system to be assessed by more senior officials.Retired IDF Maj Gen Eitan Dangot says the tatzpitaniyot play a major role in "pushing the button that says something is wrong", and that concerns they raise with a commander should be passed up the chain "to create an intelligence picture".He says the look-outs provide key "pieces of the puzzle" in understanding any threats.In the months leading up to the Hamas attacks, senior Israeli officials gave public statements suggesting that the threat posed by Hamas had been contained.But there were many signs along the border that something was very wrong.In late September, an observer at Nahal Oz writes in a WhatsApp group of friends in the unit: "What, there is another event?"A reply quickly follows by voicenote: "Girl, where've you been? We've had one every day for the past two weeks."The look-outs we speak to describe a range of incidents they observed in real-time in the months before 7 October, leading some to have concerns that an attack was coming."We would see them practising every day what the raid would look like," Noa, who is still serving in the military, tells the BBC. "They even had a model tank that they were practising how to take over."They also had a model of weapons on the fence and they would also show how they would blow it up, and co-ordinate how to take over the forces and kill and kidnap."Eden Hadar, another observer from the base, remembers that at the start of her service, Hamas fighters were doing mainly fitness training in the section she looked over. But in the months before she left the military in August, she noticed a shift to "actual military training".At a different base along the border, Gal (not her real name), says she was also watching as the training increased.She watched, via surveillance balloon, as a replica model of an automated Israeli weapon on the border was built "in the heart of Gaza", she says.Several women also describe bombs being planted and detonated near the fence - known as Israel's Iron Wall - seemingly to test its strength. Footage from 7 October would later show large explosions before Hamas fighters race through on motorbikes.For former observer Roni Lifshitz, who was still in service but not working when Hamas attacked, the most concerning thing she saw in the preceding weeks was the regular patrol of vehicles full of Hamas fighters, which would stop at watch posts on the other side of the fence.She remembers the men "talking, pointing at the cameras and the fence, taking pictures".She says she was able to identify them as being from Hamas' elite Nukhba Force because of their clothing. Israel has said this was one of the "leading forces" behind the October attacks.Roni's account matches that of another woman at the base who spoke to the BBC.Some of the watchwomen also speak of growing incidents of attempted incursions.Messages shared with us by one female soldier make reference in code to vans along the border, as well as to the IDF stopping people trying to cross into Israel, which she says was happening more frequently. Members of the unit congratulate each other on these interceptions with heart emojis and GIFs.In a message observer Shahaf Nissani sent to her mum in July, she writes: "Good morning mummy. I finished a shift now and we had an [attempted border incursion] but this event was really nerve wracking… like it was an event that no one had ever encountered."The women also started to see strange changes in patterns of behaviour along the border. Gazan farmers, bird catchers and sheep herders began moving closer to the border fence, they say. The look-outs now believe these men were collecting intelligence ahead of the attacks.  "We know each one by face and know exactly their routine and hours. Suddenly we started seeing bird catchers and farmers we don't know. We have seen them move to new territories. Their routine has changed," says observer Avigail, who requested anonymity to speak out over what she saw.Noa also remembers them getting "closer and closer" to the fence."The birders would put their cages right on the fence. It's strange because they can put the cage anywhere. The farmers would also go down right next to the fence in an area that is not agricultural and there is no reason other than to gather information about the system and see how they can pass it. It seemed suspicious to us," she says."We talked about it all the time."Not everyone we spoke to had been aware of the significance of what they were observing.Hamas was always training for an attack, and some of the women didn't anticipate that it was preparing for anything on the scale of 7 October, one said.Several watchwomen who did fear a major attack was coming have told the BBC they felt their concerns were not being listened to.When she noticed the vans on the border, Roni says the protocol was to alert her commander and then to keep watching until the vehicles were no longer in her section. She would then file it in a computer system where it would be "passed on".But, she says, she has "no idea" where these reports actually went."Probably to intelligence but whether they do something with it or not, I don't really know," she says. "No one gave us an answer back about what we had reported and conveyed."Noa says she couldn't count how many times she had filed reports. Within the unit, everyone "took it seriously and would pass it on but in the end they [people outside of the unit] didn't do anything about it".Avigail says that even when senior officials came to the base "no-one would talk to us or ask our opinion or tell us a little about what was going on"."They just came, gave a task and left," she says.As a commander at her unit, Gal says observers would pass information to her which she then passed to her supervisor.But she says that while this was included in "situation assessments" - when higher-ups at the base would discuss the reports filed by the observers - nothing seemed to be done beyond that.Several of the women say they voiced their frustrations and worries with their families.Shahaf's mother, Ilana, remembers her saying: "Why are we here if no-one's listening?""She told me that the girls see that there is a mess. And I asked, 'Are you complaining?' "And I don't exactly understand the army, but I understood that it's not the base, it's the ranks above" that needed to take action, she says.But despite Shahaf's worries, her family, like others, had full confidence in the army and the Israeli state, and believed that even if something was being planned, it would be dealt with quickly."In the last months she said again and again there will be a war, you will see. And we laughed at her for exaggerating," Ilana recalls, taking deep breaths between words.Shahaf was among the first people to be killed on 7 October, when Hamas overran Nahal Oz.It would come to be the deadliest day in Israel's history, with some 1,300 people killed, according to the prime minister's office, and 240 taken hostage.Air and ground assaults launched by Israel in response to the attacks have gone on to kill more than 23,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.While they did not know it at the time, the tatzpitaniyot were not the only ones raising concerns, and their observations were not the only intelligence that something was coming.According to a report in the New York Times, a lengthy blueprint detailing Hamas's plans had been in the hands of Israeli officials for more than a year before 7 October, but was dismissed as aspirational.A veteran analyst in Israel's intelligence agency Unit 8200 warned three months before the attacks that Hamas had conducted an intense training exercise that appeared similar to that outlined in the blueprint, but her concerns were brushed off, the newspaper reports.The drills conducted by Hamas and other armed groups had also been posted publicly on social media, as seen in this BBC investigation. "The signs were bubbling," says retired Maj Gen Eitan Dangot. "When you collect all the signs, you would make an earlier decision and do something to stop it."Unfortunately this is something that was not done."He says that while a full investigation has not yet been conducted, it is clear that the reports from the watchwomen "didn't get the attention they should have"."Sometimes it has to do with the self-confidence of senior officers… 'OK, I hear you, but I know better than you. I have the experience. I am older than you. I have the strategic picture, and it cannot be what you are telling me,' for example."Or sometimes it can also be chauvinism," he says."In intelligence, you have to sit at a round table and collect information and then build your puzzle. With these people, when you want to know what's really going on, you have to sit with them, to listen carefully to what they are telling you, what is their way of analysing it."Brig Gen Amir Avivi, former deputy commander of the Gaza division, does not believe sexism was a factor, but agrees that more should have been done to address the lookouts' concerns."I cannot say for sure exactly what happened but I can say what is expected," he says."What is expected is that when people on the border do their job and they have concerns and they see things that need to be looked at and assessed, you need to listen. Because they are the professionals. They are the ones who are really the eyes of the battalion and the brigade and the division."He says the "biggest failure" was the "assumption that they [Hamas] are deterred" - the assumption that "yes they're training, yes they have a plan but they're not going to execute it".The IDF has promised a future investigation, and responded to BBC requests by saying: "Questions of this kind will be looked into at a later stage."The observers have different opinions about why their reports didn't get a bigger response, but Avigail shares the view of several we spoke to: "It's because we are the lowest soldier in the system… so our word is considered less professional.""Everyone saw us only as eyes, they don't see a soldier," says Roni.Three months after the attacks, the surviving tatzpitaniyot and grieving families of those killed are struggling to come to terms with what happened as they wait for an investigation.In Shai Ashram's bedroom, military berets are hung on a dressing table, upon which there are drawings and photos of her dressed in uniform.Her dad, Dror, says he sometimes walks into the room and cries."She loved her job very much. She loved the army and she loved being a soldier," he says."I'm a taxi driver and I pick up people from the train station and when I see a soldier whose father is picking her up, it hurts me. I'm jealous."At her own family home, Noa looks every day at old social media videos of her friends singing and dancing at the base. She sleeps on the sofa every night, afraid to be on her own in her bedroom."It is with me everywhere - in nightmares and thoughts, in lack of sleep and lack of appetite," she says. "I am not the same person I was."Scrolling through the WhatsApp chat she shared with other tatzpitaniyot, she points at their names, saying "killed" or "kidnapped".At her base, Nahal Oz, the room where the tatzpitaniyot worked now lies in ruins, and the screens they looked through as Hamas prepared for its attack are burned and blackened.As Hamas surged through Nahal Oz, they killed dozens of people.Among the dead are many of the women who watched the border so closely for the Israeli state, and who had dared to fear - despite knowing the immense might and resources of Israel - that something like this might one day happen.Additional reporting by Idan Ben Ari. 	
14/01/2024 20:43:00	Hezbollah missile attack kills Israeli woman and son - BBC News	An elderly Israeli woman and her son have been killed in a Hezbollah missile attack from Lebanon, Israel says.The anti-tank missile hit the town of Kfar Yuval on Israel's northern border, killing Barak Ayalon, 45, and his mother Miri Ayalon, 76.Earlier the Israeli military said it killed four gunmen trying to cross from Lebanon into Israel. It comes as Hamas health officials in Gaza said 125 more people had been killed in continuing Israeli strikes.That brings the number of deaths in Gaza since Israel began retaliatory attacks on the Strip to nearly 24,000, with thousands more believed dead under rubble. Local officials say children and women account for about two-thirds of the dead. About 60,000 people have been injured.Meanwhile US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that Israel would have to transition to lower-intensity operations in Gaza.He said that in a military campaign, tactics evolve as objectives are reached, and that the US had offered assistance in sharing knowhow.Israel began striking Gaza after Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,300 mainly civilians and taking 240 more hostage.Since then Hezbollah and Israel have also traded regular fire across Israel's northern border.In Kfar Yuval, Barak Ayalon was part of the town's emergency response squad. Israeli media say his father was also seriously injured in the Hezbollah attack.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the Hezbollah guided missiles targeted several Israeli communities in the north and the IDF was striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in retaliation. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the group's aim in firing on Israel was to stop the war in Gaza.He also said the Houthi group in Yemen would continue attacking shipping in the Red Sea and that US and UK attacks on the group had been a mistake.The US should understand "that the security of the Red Sea and calm on Lebanon's front, the situation in Iraq, and all developments in the region is tied to one thing: to stop the aggression against Gaza", he said.In Gaza, Israeli tanks and aircraft continued attacking targets in southern and central areas on Sunday.Communications and internet services were down for the third day running in parts of Gaza.Reflecting on the last 100 days of war, a man who was displaced and now resides in the southern city of Rafah, Alaa Bakhit, told AFP news agency: "After 100 days, we are living in this country but we feel like bodies without souls."Every second of our life is a moment of war. Every moment and minute that passes, we are in war... There is nothing left in the country, no schools, no universities, no health services, nothing," he said."Think about the future of all these children, how will it be? How can they live after this?"Others in Gaza said they had no hope of the war ending."You cook while being afraid of being hit by an air strike. You go out to buy something from the market and all the prices are really high. Our morals have been shattered, we have no hope of returning back to our homes," Um Sharif Khalil, who was displaced from the north of Gaza, said.The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on Saturday that Israel will keep fighting until it has achieved "total victory" over Hamas. The Israeli military has said the next phase of the war will see more targeted operations against Hamas leaders and positions.	
14/01/2024 16:15:00	Iran frees Niloufar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammadi, jailed for covering Mahsa Amini death - BBC News	Iran has freed two female journalists jailed for more than a year for covering the death of Mahsa Amini, which triggered nationwide protests.Niloufar Hamedi, 31, and Elaheh Mohammadi, 36, were released on bail, Iranian media reported.The reporters are appealing against jail sentences and will remain out of prison until a court makes a decision, reports said.Ms Amini died in custody after being detained by Iran's morality police.She had been held for allegedly violating strict rules requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf.Iran's state coroner attributed her death to pre-existing medical conditions, but a UN human rights expert said the evidence established that she died "as a result of beatings" by morality police.Ms Hamedi, who worked for the reformist newspaper Shargh, broke the news of Ms Amini's death. She photographed Ms Amini's father and grandmother embracing after they learned their daughter had died and posted it online with the caption: "The black dress of mourning has become our national flag."Ms Mohammadi worked for Ham-Mihan, also a reformist paper, wrote about Ms Amini's funeral in her hometown of Saqqez. She described how hundreds of mourners cried out "Woman, life, freedom".The first protests took place after her funeral and the unrest rapidly spread across the country, with demands ranging from more freedoms to an overthrow of the state.The two journalists were arrested shortly after the protests started and charged with collaborating with the US government and colluding against national security.They were given sentences of 13 and 12 years in prison respectively.Footage on social media showed the released journalists hugging family and friends after their release. Reports said bail had been set at $200,000 (£155,000) and the women have been banned from leaving the country.	
14/01/2024 14:21:00	100 days since Hamas attacked Israel, triggering war in Gaza - BBC News	One hundred days ago, the previously unthinkable happened in Israel. A state, born out of adversity and war only 75 years ago, woke up to what some have since described as a threat to its very existence.On Saturday night, in Tel Aviv, the events of 7 October were commemorated by thousands of people. Uppermost on the minds of everyone were the around 130 hostages abducted by Hamas and still being held in Gaza, although some of them may not still be alive. Just after dawn 100 days ago, thousands of heavily armed Hamas fighters stormed through and over the Gaza border fence in several different places.They attacked kibbutzim, military bases and border towns, accustomed to rocket attacks from Gaza but overwhelmed by the scale of the Hamas incursion. At least 1,200 people were killed along the length of the border as Israeli defences were caught completely by surprise.Images of hundreds of young music lovers fleeing for their lives at the Nova festival shook Israel to its core. More than 360 people were killed at the festival site and dozens more abducted to Gaza.The number of civilians killed in the Israeli bombardment that followed the Hamas attacks has been huge. More than 23,000 have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, many of them women and children. Thousands more are believed to be dead under rubble.In Israel on Saturday, among those at the huge commemorative event in Tel Aviv were families of the disappeared, carrying posters and wearing T-shirts featuring the faces of their loved ones.I spoke to Yossi Schneider - a cousin of Shiri Bibas, who was kidnapped along with her two young children and husband.  "There are 130 people, mainly civilians being held without medicines and the Red Cross is not even being allowed to visit them," says Yossi, angered that the wider family has received little information on their physical or mental welfare. "There are three generations of my family that are disappeared. Three generations of my family! And the world is keeping silent and asking us to stay calm. I cannot take it anymore," he adds, tired but clearly frustrated.Most people here would say that 7 October was the biggest threat ever faced by Israel and that Israelis have never felt so vulnerable. While the safe return of the hostages is their absolute priority, many also agree with their government's war aims in Gaza and few voices are calling for tolerance and coexistence. As Israel's shaken defence establishment eventually responded to what was happening in the south as Saturday 7 October drew to a close, the Israeli military embarked on an unprecedented bombing campaign in Gaza - its stated goal: the complete destruction of Hamas and its support structure. Much of the territory, from Gaza city in the north to Khan Younis in the south, has since been destroyed. Israel says Hamas has been severely weakened and, according to the Israeli military, rendered almost inoperable as an organised force in northern Gaza. But the number of civilians killed in the Israeli bombardment has been enormous.Palestinian officials say that 85% of Gaza's population has been displaced. While more aid is now getting into Gaza the UN's humanitarian chief has described the situation as "intolerable".Faten Abu Shahada needs regular kidney dialysis which is one reason why she and her family have been forced to move south. Home for Faten and the kids is now a plastic tent in Khan Younis - the sound of an Israeli drone overhead their constant companion.  "Gaza has been destroyed. There's no Gaza left - no hospitals, no education," says Faten. "Our children have lost their school year, Gaza is no longer alive."Israel is coming under increasing international pressure to consider a ceasefire or pause in Gaza, such is the scale of the civilian suffering. Even its closest ally the US, which consistently defends Israel's right to self defence and to prevent a repetition of 7 October, has repeatedly told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the civilian death toll is "far too high". President Biden has spoken of Israel's "indiscriminate bombing", which he said meant the country was losing support around the world.Gideon Levy is a columnist for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and a frequent critic of Mr Netanyahu. I asked him if this war - already Israel's longest since 1948 - would soon come to a conclusion.  "The war in its current shape will last as long as Americans will allow Israel (to do it)," says Levy. He adds: "I don't think it will be many weeks more. But that doesn't mean that the war is over because nobody has thought about the day after. "If Israel doesn't pull out of Gaza, there will be resistance. And if there is resistance there will be retaliation."As Israeli troops continue to attack Hamas positions in central and southern Gaza, ending the war seems to be far from Mr Netanyahu's intentions. Israel says the fighting will not end until Hamas is completely defeated. The immediate future across the region, and especially for thousands of civilians living in appalling conditions in Gaza, looks particularly bleak. 	
14/01/2024 14:06:00	UK will back words with actions against Houthis in Yemen - Cameron - BBC News	Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the UK is "prepared to back our words with actions" against the Houthis, after taking military action in Yemen over their attacks in the Red Sea.Lord Cameron told the BBC the US-UK air strikes were needed after months of attacks on shipping, despite warnings. Sir Keir Starmer said he had backed the operation as "action had to be taken". But the Labour leader said he would consider whether to support further action "on its merit".Looking at the global security situation on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Lord Cameron cautioned it is "hard to remember a more unstable, dangerous and uncertain world".He said the "red lights on the global dashboard are very much flashing", given ongoing wars in Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa. Lord Cameron said the UK had given the Houthis, who are key allies of Hamas, "warning after warning" before joining US-led strikes, which were launched to protect global shipping.The Houthis are a political and military group which control a large part of Yemen, including the capital. They are backed by Iran, Israel's arch-enemy and claim they target any ship travelling to, or owned by, Israel. They have carried out at least 27 attacks since 19 November, according to the US, and have launched a series of drones and missiles towards Israel. The group's attacks on cargo ships - some of which have no clear connection to Israel - have led major shipping companies to divert vessels away from the Red Sea, instead taking a longer route around southern Africa. Confirming there would be a statement in Parliament about the strikes on Monday, Lord Cameron said a political debate before this kind of military action would not have been right "for reasons of operational security".Asked if the attacks represented an escalation of the Israel-Gaza conflict, he denied this and told the BBC the Houthis were responsible for escalating their attacks on shipping in the vital sea lane since mid-November and the joint UK-US strikes were a "last resort". He said: "The strikes themselves were limited, proportionate, targeted, legal, but they were also necessary."Sir Keir told the programme he backed the UK military operation so far as "action had to be taken" to protect shipping in the Red Sea and that "sitting back and simply doing nothing" over the threat to global trade was not appropriate.But he also said Labour would need to consider the arguments if the UK plans further attacks in Yemen and he would expect to be briefed by the government.  Asked if he had changed his position on whether the government has to give MPs a say on UK military action, Sir Keir denied this and said a vote was only needed when "deploying troops".Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been criticised by some opposition parties for not consulting Parliament in advance of the strikes, though the government does not have to do this. The Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru have said it is wrong that parliament was bypassed and the SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said the decision to launch air strikes against the Houthis without consulting MPs was "farcical".The Houthis have said there was "absolutely no justification" for the attacks and that the group would continue to target Israeli ships, noting the air strikes have not affected their ability to do so.On Sunday, prominent Houthi supporter Hussain Al-Bukhaiti told Laura Kuenssberg the group "only target Israeli-linked ships" or those heading towards ports there, because they have declared war on Israel.Asked about attacks on unrelated ships, he questioned what international law was doing to protect civilians in Gaza from Israel's "mass-bombing" campaign.  On how the Houthis would respond to the air strikes, he said if attacks continue fighters could target US and UK battleships using "hundreds of drones and cruise missiles".Houthis control north Yemen, capital Sanaa and the Red Sea coastline. The armed group declares themselves to be part of the Iranian-led "axis of resistance" against Israel, the US and wider West.Lord Cameron and Sir Keir were asked about the deaths of five people trying to cross the English Channel overnight.He said said it was "heartbreaking" to hear more people had died, "but it just shows we've got to stop the boats, we've got to stop this illegal trade in human beings."The former PM said breaking the business model of people smugglers is why the government is pursuing the deal with Rwanda to send some asylum seekers to east Africa on a one-way ticket. Sir Keir called the deaths a "tragic loss of life" adding that "we need to smash those gangs". Rejecting the "gimmick" of the Rwanda scheme, he talked about the prosecution of gangs as Director of Public Prosecutions."Having seen this done for terrorist gangs, with guns and with drugs I refuse to believe we can't do anything about it," he said. Lord Cameron was also asked about his private lobbying of ministers to try to secure an emergency pandemic loan scheme for disgraced financier Lex Greensill. The former prime minister denied being paid £10 million to work on behalf of Greensill Capital, following his resignation as PM in 2016.  After refusing to tell Laura Kuenssberg how much he was paid, he said: "I was a private citizen, I had a number of different interests, the things I did, including important charitable work and I think as a private citizen you're entitled to do that."	
14/01/2024 13:55:00	Starmer denies backtracking on military action vote - BBC News	Sir Keir Starmer has denied changing his position on whether the government has to give MPs a vote on any plans by the UK to take military action.The Labour leader backed the US-UK air strikes in Yemen, launched without a parliamentary vote.He told the BBC on Sunday a vote was only needed when "deploying troops".During his leadership campaign Sir Keir had pledged to create a law requiring "the consent of the Commons" for military action.Speaking on Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday, Sir Keir said action had to be taken against Houthi targets because "sitting back and doing nothing" would not have been appropriate.Downing Street briefed Sir Keir shortly before the operation on Thursday. He said he backed the air strikes but wants ministers to make a detailed Commons statement on Monday, as is planned.The Houthis are a political and military group controlling a large part of Yemen. Backed by Iran, members claim they target any ship travelling to or owned by Israel. They have carried out at least 27 attacks since 19 November, according to the US, and have launched a series of drones and missiles towards Israel. The group's attacks on cargo ships - some of which have no clear connection to Israel - have led major shipping companies to divert vessels away from the Red Sea, instead taking a longer route around southern Africa. Sir Keir told the BBC Labour would need to consider the arguments if the UK plans further attacks in Yemen and he would expect to be briefed by the government.While campaigning to take over from Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader in 2020, Sir Keir said he wanted a new law "that said military action could be taken if first the lawful case for it was made, secondly there was a viable objective and thirdly you got the consent of the Commons".This would enshrine in law the principle that UK military action should be voted on and approved by parliament, But Sir Keir insisted there was "no inconsistency" between his previous comments and his support for the air strikes in Yemen, telling the programme that there is a difference between this action on Houthi targets and "sustained" military action.Separately pressed on whether he had changed a commitment to stop the UK selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, Sir Keir said he supported a review into all UK arms sales which will "make clear" what his party's position is.The Labour leader argued his party is different now from the one he ran to lead in 2020. Separately, reports that five people have died in an attempt to cross the English Channel are a "tragic loss of life", Sir Keir said.The deaths show "we need to stop these Channel crossings", he said. Rejecting the "gimmick" of the Rwanda scheme, he talked about the prosecution of gangs as Director of Public Prosecutions."Having seen this done for terrorist gangs, with guns and with drugs I refuse to believe we can't do anything about it," he said. Elsewhere in a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, Sir Keir said he still backed Labour's key pledge to invest £28bn in green projects "by the second half of the Parliament" if elected.Labour's Green Prosperity Plan has gone through various changes since it was first announced in September 2021.But Sir Keir said Labour wanted the UK to run on 100% clean power by 2030 as it "gives us cheaper bills, and it gives us energy security so Putin can't put his boot on our throat."The investment depends on a number of caveats. Labour has committed to reducing government debt within five years, and any investment would be "subject to what the government has already assigned to put in on green prosperity".Chief secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott accused Sir Keir of not "having a plan to pay" for the investment. "That means one thing - thousands of pounds in higher taxes for hard-working people," she said.	
14/01/2024 12:39:00	Stephen Flynn fears 'wider regional crisis' after Yemen air strikes - BBC News	SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn has warned US-UK air strikes in Yemen must not result in a "much wider crisis" in the region.Mr Flynn also said the decision to launch airstrikes against the Houthis without consulting MPs was "farcical".Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the UK was "prepared to back our words with actions" against the rebels.And Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he supported strikes against the group as "action had to be taken".The Houthis have been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claiming to be targeting Israel-linked vessels.The Iranian-backed group - who control much of Yemen, including the capital - began targeting commercial vessels after the start of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October.Mr Flynn said he was was concerned about a possible escalation of tensions, following the first wave of air strikes on Friday and urged the government to outline its medium and long term aims.He told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show: "We need to make sure that the action the government has taken doesn't precipitate a much wider crisis in the region, nor indeed drag the UK or our allies into prolonged conflict in the Middle East, given the impact that has had in the past."The Aberdeen South MP said it was important to defend freedom of navigation and stressed it was vital to prevent further increases in the price of goods during a cost of living crisis.But he added: "We need to understand what it is the government is hoping to achieve here."Because if its simply a case of saying that those airstrikes are going to defeat the Houthis that's not going to happen. Everyone knows that's not going to happen."So what comes next and how does this fit in to the wider regional picture at this time, which we know is extremely volatile?"Mr Flynn also said he was looking for answers from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who said the UK had acted in self-defence.He added: "It's a bit farcical that they waited until the moment parliament had shut its doors to make an announcement that this was what they were intending to do."Mr Sunak has been criticised by some opposition parties for not consulting Parliament in advance of the strikes, though the government does not have to do this.He will give his first statement to MPs on the matter on Monday.The SNP Westminster leader also repeated his calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, 100 days on from the start of the conflict.On Saturday the UK's former ambassador to Yemen, Frances Guy, warned airstrikes targeting Houthi rebels in the country played "right into extremist hands".More than 60 targets were hit on Friday by strikes backed by UK and US allies.Further US action was carried out on Saturday, but Ms Guy - who served as UK ambassador to the country between 2001 and 2004 - said it would only "embolden" sympathisers of the group.Meanwhile, the Houthis have said attacks will only stop when a break in the fighting between Israel and Hamas is declared.The Houthis declared their support for Hamas and said they would target any ship travelling to Israel shortly after the conflict broke out more than three months ago.It is not clear that all of the ships attacked were bound for Israel, but many international container ships have rerouted to avoid the area for fear of attacks.The rebel group, who have been fighting a civil war since 2014 against Yemen's government, said they will stop if a ceasefire is declared.Early steps towards peace talks took place in December but Houthi negotiators have said that the attacks do not threaten those discussions.On Saturday a Houthi spokesman told Reuters the US-UK strikes had no significant impact on the group's ability to affect shipping.	
14/01/2024 03:47:00	US delivers 'private message' to Iran after Yemen strikes - BBC News	President Biden says the US has delivered a "private message" to Iran about the Houthis in Yemen after the US carried out a second strike on the group."We delivered it privately and we're confident we're well-prepared," he said without giving further details.The US said its latest strike was a "follow-on action" targeting radar.Iran denies involvement in attacks by the Houthis in the Red Sea.However Tehran is suspected of supplying the Houthis with weapons, and the US says Iranian intelligence is critical to enabling them to target ships. Joint UK-US airstrikes targeted nearly 30 Houthi positions in the early hours of Friday with the support of Western allies including Australia and Canada.A day later, the US Central Command said it carried out its latest strike on a Houthi radar site in Yemen using Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles.UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Britain had "no choice" but to take military action against the Houthis in Yemen, in response to their attacks on ships in the Red Sea.Writing in the Telegraph, he said UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had agreed to a request by the US to assist with the "limited and targeted" strikes.A Houthi spokesman told Reuters the strikes had no significant impact on the group's ability to affect shipping.The Houthis are an armed group from a sub-sect of Yemen's Shia Muslim minority, the Zaidis. Most Yemenis live in areas under Houthi control. As well as Sanaa and the north of Yemen, the Houthis control the Red Sea coastline.The official Western government line is that the ongoing air strikes on Houthi targets are quite separate from the war in Gaza. They are "a necessary and proportionate response" to the unprovoked and unacceptable Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea, they say.In Yemen and the wider Arab world they are viewed rather differently.There, they are seen as the US and UK joining in the Gaza war on the side of Israel, since the Houthis have declared their actions to be in solidarity with Hamas and the people of Gaza. One theory even says that "the West is doing Netanyahu's bidding".It is still possible that these airstrikes will have a chilling effect on the Houthis. They will certainly degrade their capacity to attack ships in the short term.But the longer these airstrikes persist, the greater the risk that the US and UK get sucked into another conflict in Yemen.It has taken the Saudis more than eight years to extricate themselves from there after it intervened in the country's civil war - and the Houthis are now more entrenched than ever.About 15% of global seaborne trade passes through the Red Sea, the US says. This includes 8% of global grain, 12% of seaborne oil and 8% of the world's liquified natural gas. The US says the group has so far attempted to attack and harass vessels in the Red Sea and the gulf of Aden 28 times.Some major shipping companies have since ceased operations in the region, while insurance costs have risen 10 times since early December.London and Washington have backed Israel following the 7 October attacks by Hamas in which about 1,300 people were killed and some 240 were taken hostage.Israel's retaliatory military campaign of air strikes and ground operations against Hamas in Gaza have killed 23,843 Palestinians so far, according to the Hamas-run health ministry on Saturday, with thousands more believed dead under rubble.	
13/01/2024 18:29:00	Yemen strikes 'embolden' extremists - former ambassador - BBC News	The UK's former ambassador to Yemen has warned airstrikes targeting Houthi rebels in the country played "right into extremist hands".Frances Guy also said Britain's priority should be pursuing a ceasefire in Gaza.US and UK forces began launching missiles into Yemen in response to attacks on ships sailing through the Red Sea on Friday.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the UK acted in self-defence.And he described the strikes as "necessary, proportionate, and targeted".Ms Guy spoke to BBC Scotland News while attending a Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign demonstration in Edinburgh.During the event a woman was arrested after her car was involved in a crash with several protestors.Police Scotland said the incident happened at about 14:30 on Ramsay Lane.A force spokeswoman said: "Officers received reports of minor injuries from pedestrians, but no medical attention was required."A 70-year-old woman has been arrested and charged in connection with a driving offence."Meanwhile, the Houthis have said attacks will only stop when a break in the fighting between Israel and Hamas is declared.The Iranian-backed rebel group - who control much of Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa - began targeting commercial vessels after the start of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October.More than 60 targets were hit by the first wave of strikes backed by UK and US allies.Further US action was carried out on Saturday, but Ms Guy - who served as UK ambassador to the country between 2001 and 2004 - said it would only "embolden" sympathisers of the group.The former diplomat said: "They have been responding in a way that has been exactly what extremists would like because it makes it easy for the Arab street to be very anti-American and anti-British and the military action itself doesn't achieve very much."The more of this kind of attack happens, the more sympathisers there are around the world with those who they see as oppressed by American and British action."Ms Guy told BBC Scotland News the Houthis were wrong to hit international shipping and said it was a "reasonable response" to target missiles aimed at vessels. But she added: "Sending missiles into Yemen and getting five million Yemenis in the street shouting against America doesn't feel very productive."The Houthis declared their support for Hamas and said they would target any ship travelling to Israel shortly after the conflict broke out more than three months ago.It is not clear that all of the ships attacked were bound for Israel, but many international container ships have rerouted to avoid the area for fear of attacks.The rebel group, who have been fighting a civil war since 2014 against Yemen's government, said they will stop if a ceasefire is declared.Early steps towards peace talks took place in December but Houthi negotiators have said that the attacks do not threaten those discussions.Ms Guy urged the UK and US governments to "call their bluff" or risk worsening the humanitarian crises in Yemen and Gaza.She said: "America and Britain are seen in Yemen as friends of Israel because our governments have stood out very strongly saying that and are not talking enough about the humanitarian horrors that are going on in Gaza and are now risked in Yemen."I don't think it is possible to disentangle the two conflicts. I do think ceasefire is at the heart of this."The immediate easiest riposte is to have an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, not least because we seem to have lost sight of the fact there is incredible humanitarian suffering going on in Gaza every day and the most important thing to do right now is to put an end to that suffering."Ms Guy was among hundreds of protesters who gathered in Edinburgh and Glasgow on Saturday to demand a pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas.Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign demonstrations events were also held in Aberdeen, Dundee, Dumfries and Orkney.	
13/01/2024 18:24:00	Israel strikes southern Gaza city swollen with displaced people - BBC News	Ten people in a house sheltering two displaced families in Rafah were among 135 people killed in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours, Hamas-run health ministry officials said.The southern Gaza city's population has swollen to well over a million people as displaced people from other parts of Gaza seek safety there.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was looking into the reports.Rockets were also fired from Gaza into southern Israel.Rafah resident Samir Qeshta told AFP his home had been "completely destroyed" in Israeli bombardment while he and his wife had been out."This house sheltered me and my children... We are peaceful people, they struck us without prior warning," he said.Nimma al-Akhras was at home when the bombardment began."The strike was unimaginable," she says. "We started screaming and I couldn't move until someone carried me and put me on a cart."What did we do wrong? We were just sitting. It's not safe in our homes nor outside. Where can we possibly go?"The IDF held a short pause in military activity in the city "for humanitarian purposes" following earlier strikes.Israel says it is targeting Hamas members and their infrastructure and tries to minimise civilian casualties.In a post on Telegram, health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said that infrastructure and medical services in Rafah could not handle the needs of an estimated 1.3 million displacepeople."Rafah is reaching a breaking point because of the influx of hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians and their families," he said.Doctors in the city's Nasser hospital said they were struggling to provide care in a "collapsed" healthcare system."Most of the medical supplies in the ICU are missing," Dr Mohammad al-Qidra told Reuters. "We don't have empty beds, no treatments. Most of the medicines inside the emergency room are not enough for patients. We are trying to find alternatives."Many displaced people are also using the hospital wards for shelter.The World Health Organisation says fewer than half of Gaza's hospitals are functioning and those only partly. Very few ambulances were operational across the Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run health ministry added.In the central Gaza Strip, residents reported intense gun battles, tank shelling and Israeli air strikes in the Bureij, Nuseirat and Maghazi refugee camps - dense urban areas.The Israeli military said it had hit several targets there and killed numerous fighters.The IDF also said it had killed Hamas fighters in Khan Younis, while Hamas said it had fired at an IDF helicopter near the city.The BBC cannot verify the battlefield claims.A total of 23,843 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have now been killed in Israel's military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says.Israel launched its campaign after hundreds of Hamas gunmen infiltrated southern Israeli communities from Gaza, killing about 1,300 people and taking about 240 others hostage.	
13/01/2024 15:41:00	Kuenssberg: The thorny politics of Houthi strikes for Sunak and Starmer - BBC News	"To wake up and find out your country has bombed another country is serious indeed." As a former minister put it, you are not alone if you heard the headlines on the radio, or a news alert pinged on your phone saying the UK had carried out military strikes on Yemen and wondered, what on earth is going on? So why did Prime Minister Rishi Sunak get the UK involved in the strikes on the Houthis? As so often in politics, the causes and the consequences are simple but complex too. Here's the straightforward part. The Houthis, who control much of northern Yemen, have been attacking ships sailing through the Red Sea. That route carries billions of pounds worth of oil, gas, consumer goods, the "stuff" we buy and consume every day. If it's too dangerous to make that voyage, ships literally have to go the long way round, adding days to their journeys, and cost and disruption to supply chains our economy can ill afford. It might be thousands of miles away, but the costs would be felt right at home. The UN had expressed serious concern over the attacks. And having made successive warnings, the US and the UK decided to strike to protect a vital trade route and uphold international law.Serious, but simple. Not so fast. The US and UK might say the attacks are not related to the raging conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, but that's not how it's seen by the other side.The Houthis say their attacks on shipping are punishment for Israel's military offensive in Gaza, claiming any ship destined for Israel or with Israeli links is a "legitimate target", even though the Houthis have also attacked ships that have no links to Israel.  A group like the Houthis, that calls for the destruction of Israel, wants to be part of the wider war. Add to that, the UK has, for years, supported a Saudi-led coalition bombing the Houthis in Yemen after the group took control of parts of the country from the internationally recognised government. UK weapons have been used by the coalition, there have been thousands of civilian casualties, and the Saudis have been accused of breaching international law. In the past couple of years there has been progress towards a settlement of sorts, but it remains one of the poorest countries in the world, broken by years of conflict, shortages of food, water, and violence. It is well worth a look at my colleague Orla Guerin's reporting from the country in the summer.And here is the even more complicated part. The Houthis are allies of Iran, which has been backing them with weapons and expertise, their links growing stronger long before the latest conflict. It is Iranian drones and missiles that the Houthis are using against international shipping.Iran, with its links to Russia and China, has long vied for influence in the Middle East region, with its bitter rival Saudi Arabia, which has links to the US and Western powers. This is not just about a few ships in the Red Sea. For Rishi Sunak therefore, the main reason to get involved was clear, but the consequences may be much more murky. If the Houthi's attacks continue, a precedent has been set and it is hard for the UK not to strike again.For how long is the government prepared to continue? How ready is it for an escalation in the wider war? How will ministers grapple with the impression that by striking the Houthis, they have picked a side in the wider Middle East conflict? A senior MP says the action must come with a "more robust message" for Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu to counter that impression. A former cabinet minister told me the UK must "make sure the Houthis get a very bloody nose and Iran sees it; strengthen the international coalition, and confirm our intention to stay there; push Israel for a swift plan for post Gaza and encourage the Abraham Accords project in a way we have sadly not done so far".The Abraham Accords were agreements to normalise relations between Israel and Arab countries - not a comprehensive peace plan, but diplomatic moves nonetheless. And while prime ministers sometimes thrive on the influence foreign interventions can bring, failed actions can consume huge amounts of political time, energy, and reputation. There is no strong resistance from the normally extremely grumpy Conservative backbenches on the decision to take military action. But Rishi Sunak will be pushed on what comes next when he stands up to deliver a statement in the Commons on Monday. As the Conservative former minister Neil O'Brien, no enemy of No 10, said this week: "Given our main interventions of the last 25 years have been failures, let's be clear up front - what counts as success, realistically, how far would we need to go to achieve this? How will we avoid being dragged into something we don't want?"The UK did not have to take part. The former minister ponders if Rishi Sunak would have decided to launch UK strikes were it not for the experience of his newish foreign secretary, telling me: "I see David Cameron's hand playing in here - certainly he has the experience, and there is no way [former foreign secretary] James Cleverly would be able to give this level of advice." The US carried out strikes on the Houthis on its own in 2016, and indeed, this morning. Might it have been different this time? We'll have Lord Cameron live in the studio on the programme on Sunday to discuss it. The military action is instinctively trickier territory for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. Labour nerves still jangle over what went so terribly wrong in Iraq, even after all these years.The Labour leadership has already run into unhappiness over its position on Gaza, stopping short of calling for an immediate ceasefire. Deep concern for Palestinians continues to be a binding motivation for swathes of Labour MPs and activists. Keir Starmer was briefed by Downing Street on Thursday's air strikes, and backed them on the understanding that they were limited, and targeted, and noting that the UK was not in control of the timing. But for a strand of Labour MPs on the left of the party this goes against the grain. Starmer's allies don't consider this a particular problem for the public. Indeed he is only too happy to contrast himself with predecessor Jeremy Corbyn and his former tribe - MPs like John McDonnell and Diane Abbott and the campaign group Momentum. But if the strikes continue or expand and he continues to back them, he risks riling a larger group in the party. And there is a tension with Starmer's own previous position too. During his 2020 Labour leadership campaign, he proposed a law to require a Commons vote on military action before it took place. Keir Starmer will also be with us on Sunday morning for his New Year interview. Is backing this action without a vote in Parliament another example of the Labour leader ditching his past promises as he edges closer to power? His critics, inside and outside the Labour Party, will be all too eager to leap on that.The agonies at Westminster over holding a vote can look like an example of MPs' focusing on their own neighbourhood at the expense of the bigger picture. I'm not suggesting MPs' voices don't matter, or that Parliament should not have a say on the most serious decisions any government can make.But at the same time, I don't know a single senior UK politician who would - in office, in the real world - give up the power known as the Royal Prerogative to take military action without the overt permission of Parliament.  The truth is it is a convention to consult Parliament, but not a law, whatever a younger Keir Starmer proposed. And holding a vote, or not holding a vote, may not be a guarantee of success or failure, whether military or political. There was no vote on sending troops to Afghanistan in 2001. There was a vote on the war in Iraq in 2003. David Cameron lost a vote on taking action in Syria in 2013 so did not proceed, telling MPs: "I get it". Theresa May did not ask MPs before a strike on that country in 2018. So if you woke up on Friday morning wondering what on earth was going on the answer is indeed, it's both simple and complicated. The decision taken by Rishi Sunak was both obvious and risky. Keir Starmer's decision to back it was too. The prime minister, and the Labour leader who sees himself as the prime-minister-in-waiting, are, like all Western leaders in 2024, grappling with a world where other dominant countries are less attached to conventional international rules. Add to that the possible return, by the end of the year, of a US president who relishes busting those conventions too.  A confidant of Rishi Sunak recently told me they were increasingly realising that government is nearly always a choice between two unappealing options. In this election year most of our votes, most of our political conversations will be shaped by the old reality that all politics is local. But the past few days shows what is global is vital to our politics too.

The UK joined the US in launching airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen overnight on Thursday. The Houthis have been attacking shipping in the Red Sea since November.The Iranian-backed political and military group - who control a large part of Yemen - claims to be targeting ships in response to Israel's attacks on Gaza. On Friday, US and British forces responded with air strikes on 16 targets in Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, including logistical hubs, air defence systems and military depots. A follow-up strike was also carried out on Saturday, US officials said. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Mr Shapps said Iran has a vital role to play in de-escalating Middle East tensions.Asked about his message to the Iranian government Tehran, he said: "You must get the Houthi rebels, others who are acting as proxies for you, Lebanese Hezbollah are obvious examples, (and) some in Iraq and Syria, you must get these different organisations to cease and desist because we are, the world is, running out of patience."We see you, we see through what you're doing. We see how you're doing it, particularly the Houthi rebels, and no good can come from it."Mr Shapps also argued the UK was "acting in self-defence" over the threat to container ships and an attack on Royal Navy destroyer HMS Diamond by a drone last month.Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with Israel across the border with Lebanon since the Israeli military launched its campaign in response to the unprecedented Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October.Around 1,300 people were killed in Israel and 240 more kidnapped. Israel's retaliatory strikes and ground offensive in Gaza has since led to more than 23,000 people there being killed.Iranian proxies in Syria and Iraq have also regularly been launching attacks on US military bases in the region since the war broke out.Houthi attacks in the Red Sea increased 500% between November and December last year. The threat has become so great that major shipping companies have ceased sailing in the region and insurance costs have risen 10-fold since early December.The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead.	
13/01/2024 00:02:00	Tough choices for Israel in US's Middle East vision - BBC News	At a press briefing in Tel Aviv on Tuesday - after a day of meetings with Israeli leaders - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was surprisingly upbeat.Answering a question about the future of Gaza, he said he had just delivered a "new" and "very powerful" message to the Israelis - one that would end the cycle of violence in the Middle East once and for all.Blinken had spent the past four days travelling around the Middle East, with three objectives - persuading Israel to wind down its offensive, reducing tensions in the region, and easing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.As he concluded a trip which also took in Turkey, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, US-led air strikes were launched at Houthis in Yemen. While Blinken flew back across the Atlantic, the attacks will have left him wondering how his second objective can be met.  But the news conference in Tel Aviv days before hinted at the possibility of progress on what lies ahead.Here was the offer: The Arab leaders would support regional integration, including normalised relations with Israel, in exchange for an end to the Gaza War, and Israel's acceptance of a "clear path" to Palestinian political rights and a unified Palestinian state, comprising the West Bank and Gaza.The plan, Blinken says, would have the additional benefit of isolating Iran and reducing what he said was its malign efforts to destablise the region through proxy actors like Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthi movement.The US secretary has acknowledged that adopting the American proposal would require some hard choices on the part of the Israelis, but he insisted that the promise of a durable regional peace was worth the effort."The other path," Blinken said, "is to continue to see the terrorism, the nihilism, the destruction by Hamas, by the Houthis, by Hezbollah, all backed by Iran."A senior US State Department official, speaking on background, was even more blunt - Israel ultimately doesn't have a choice. At some point, the official told me, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israelis would have to face the reality that if they don't make concessions to their Arab neighbours, they will be left dealing with the chaos and devastation they created in Gaza on their own. The Arabs simply will not fund yet another rebuild, and no-one - including the Americans - has any interest in participating in the kind of multinational peacekeeping force that Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant suggested last week."Other Arab countries will not contribute to the reconstruction of Gaza unless it is part of a bigger political settlement," says Kim Ghattas, a Lebanon-based Middle East expert and author of Black Wave, a book on the Saudi-Iran rivalry. "Netanyahu doesn't seem to have grasped that yet."This, in essence, has become the American strategy for the Gaza War endgame. The carrot for the Israelis is normalisation and regional stability. The stick? Well, the stick is that there are no other carrots out there. Just a lot of bad options.The stick certainly isn't the threat of terminating, or even placing conditions on, US aid to the Israelis, which American officials, from President Joe Biden on down, have routinely ruled out.There are other components to the American plan, including pressuring the Palestinian Authority to enact political and judicial reforms - addressing corruption, increasing transparency and loosening media restrictions - that would position it to govern a unified Palestinian state. On Wednesday, Blinken's armoured motorcade rolled from Tel Aviv to Ramallah in the West Bank for a closed-door meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas - talks, the US secretary said, that resulted in a commitment to enact meaningful change.Dov Waxman, a professor of Israel studies at UCLA, is not certain such a commitment is solid, however."Since the Palestinian Authority is now widely perceived by Palestinians to be illegitimate, it makes it very hard for its officials, including Abbas himself, to support democratising because doing so would jeopardise their own rule and even the Authority's continued existence," he said.If Blinken's trip was heavy on discussion of a seemingly distant future of regional peace, it was short on concrete details about how to get to that point. Israel, at least so far, has shown few signs of winding down its Gaza campaign - an essential first step before any grand American-brokered deal can begin to take shape."The Biden administration is somehow still hoping it can put this on the table as an end goal to work towards, using the normalisation talks as lever or momentum, including to convince the Israelis to get on board the process," says Ghattas. "That's all fine in theory, but in practice it's going to be very hard."While the Americans have said Israel is on the verge of lowering the tempo of its campaign, in the south of Gaza, around the town of Khan Younis, Israel's efforts have been intensifying of late.Blinken did announce on Tuesday night that the Americans and Israelis had reached an agreement to allow a UN-led "assessment mission" to enter the northern part of the Gaza Strip to determine when Palestinian civilians can return to their homes.The plan was light on details, however, and the assessment is almost certain to be bleak. Blinken acknowledged that the effort won't achieve results "overnight". Much of Gaza City has been reduced to rubble, unexploded ordnance is a concern, and public services are limited at best.In fact, Gaza as a whole is teetering on the brink of a humanitarian abyss. Early in the trip, Blinken visited a World Food Programme warehouse in Amman, Jordan, that serves as a depot for aid to Gaza. Before his arrival, Sheri Ritsema-Anderson, UN resident coordinator at UN Jordan, painted a dire picture of the situation for Palestinian civilians."In the last 15 years that I've been in the Middle East, I've not seen a situation like this," she told me. "This is catastrophic."It's not just food, she added. Power stations and wastewater facilities need fuel. Hospitals need supplies and equipment. The number of aid trucks entering Gaza, through circuitous routes from Jordan and elsewhere, are not nearly enough.Talking to reporters in Cairo before departing the region on Thursday, Blinken bristled at the suggestion that the Americans have been too focused on long-term planning instead of the more pressing humanitarian concerns."We're very focused on this," he said. "It is vital that as long as this is going on, every effort is be made to make sure that civilians who are caught in the crossfire of Hamas's making don't continue to suffer."The numbers are what they are, however. The conflict has resulted in the death of more than 23,000 Palestinians so far, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. And American - and Blinken's - attention is stretched thin, as was clearly demonstrated during his Middle East tour. Houthi rebel attacks on commercial shipping have virtually shut down the Red Sea. The clashes between Israeli and Hezbollah along the Israel-Lebanon border appear to be intensifying. US forces in Syria and Iraq are under attack by Iran-backed militias. The situation was fraught when Blinken arrived in the region on Friday 5 January. It remains so as he concluded his fourth solo trip here since the war began.There is sure to be a fifth trip soon enough. And many more. "I think the Biden administration is desperately trying to do some damage-control over its continued support for the war and opposition to an immediate ceasefire," UCLA's Waxman said. The White House, he said, wants to assure Arab allies - and domestic critics within Biden's Democratic Party - that they understand Palestinian grievances and aren't giving Israel a green light for unconstrained warfare. With this latest seven-day, 10-stop diplomatic effort, the Americans appear determined to prove they are inexhaustable, if nothing else. And they seemed convinced that the effort, even if it appears to be short on results at the moment, is proof of continuing American power and influence."The path is clearly there," Blinken said of a way to regional peace. "It's possible. We can see it."A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, as the saying goes. But the American secretary on this trip spent considerably more time talking about where the path ends than how it might start.Correction 19th January 2024: This article has been amended to state that more than 23,000 Palestinians have been killed instead of 23,000 civilians.Huge challenges for Israel on its vague ‘day after’ Gaza planStakes are immense as Biden presses Israel to change courseHamas support soars in West Bank - but full uprising can still be avoidedThe status quo is smashed.

12/01/2024 22:39:00	US will respond if Houthis continue attacks - Biden - BBC News	US President Joe Biden says there will be further retaliation against the Houthis should the group continue with its "outrageous behaviour". The US and UK launched dozens of airstrikes on Friday - targeting nearly 30 Houthi positions in response to recent attacks on ships in the Red Sea.Five people were killed, the group reported - vowing to retaliate.Mr Biden said the strikes were a success and that he thought the Houthis were a "terrorist" group. Some 73 missiles were launched at Yemen during the strike, the Houthis reported. They said the attack meant UK and US interests were now legitimate targets. "They [US and UK] committed an idiocy with this treacherous aggression," said Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam. "We're not interested in a war with Yemen," said White House national security spokesperson John Kirby. However, he added that Mr Biden "won't hesitate to take further action to protect our troops and our facilities and international commerce". Friday's attacks had the backing of US-UK allies including Canada and Australia. According to the Pentagon, the group may currently not have the ability to mount a significant military response."We did see one anti-ship ballistic missile that was fired today that did not hit any ships of any kind," said Director of Operations Lt Gen Douglas A Sims ll.Earlier, there were reports from a UK maritime security group that a missile was fired at a vessel off the southern coast of Yemen but no damage or injury was reported. The British maritime security firm Ambrey said it was a tanker carrying Russian oil that was wrongly targeted by the Houthis, who thought the vessel had a UK connection. But the US has made it clear they believe Iran - a Houthi ally - is pulling the strings and providing the group with the resources it needs to carry out the Red Sea attacks. Tehran, for its part, has condemned the strikes on Yemen as a violation of international laws. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak denied Friday's strikes were excessive - a claim levelled by Tukey, who accused the two countries of trying to turn the Red Sea into a "sea of blood". Both Mr Sunak and Mr Biden faced criticism that their legislatures were not fully consulted before the attacks were launched. With tensions high over the possibility that the strikes could further destabilise the Middle East, both the UK and US are keen to stress that the airstrikes were simply to protect shipping routes and nothing to do with the Israel-Gaza conflict. The countries have backed Israel following the 7 October attacks by Hamas in which about 1,300 died and some 240 people were taken hostage. The Houthis support Hamas, which is the focus of a military campaign by Israel in Gaza that has seen 23,350 people die so far, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. In response to the outbreak of war, the Houthis began attacking ships they said were destined for Israel or with Israeli links, describing them as a "legitimate target".Some 27 ships have been targeted in the Red Sea to date, according to the Pentagon, but many commercial vessels that have been targeted appear to have no such connection.The threat posed by the Houthis has become so great that major shipping companies have ceased sailing in the region and insurance costs have risen 10-fold since early December.In the Yemeni capital Sanaa - which is under Houthi control - there were mass demonstrations against the US-UK strikes."This rally is first to condemn this aggression against the Republic of Yemen last night," one man told the Reuters news agency. "It is also a message to Britain and the United States of America in particular, that they will pay a heavy price for this aggression." There have been regular mass rallies in Yemen in support of the Palestinians and Gaza since October but this Friday's were exceptionally large. The Houthis are an armed group from a sub-sect of Yemen's Shia Muslim minority, the Zaidis. They declare themselves to be part of the Iranian-led "axis of resistance" - along with the Hamas and Hezbollah groups - against Israel, the US and the wider West.They control a large swathe of north-western Yemen - including the country's largest city, Sana'a - and have effectively become the de-facto government there after seizing control in 2014. There is a whole spectrum of possible scenarios which could now develop in the Red Sea, ranging from the optimistic to the catastrophic.Best case: tempers cool, the Houthis have second thoughts and refrain from attacking any more shipping. This is unlikely. Today's mass demo shows they have massive popular support at home and they have already issued defiant warnings of retaliation.Worst case: the Houthis continue targeting shipping and also make good on their promise to attack US/UK assets and manage to score a direct missile hit on a warship.This is a militia that has spent years resisting devastating airstrikes by the Saudi Air Force and is now, thanks in part to help from Iran, more firmly in control of much of Yemen than ever. The Houthis think they are invincible. They certainly have patience and an abundance of weaponry, much of it hidden in mountain tunnels.There is now a dangerous inflection point for the US-led coalition in the Red Sea whereby it risks getting sucked into a costly and unwinnable war, just as the Saudis did.	
12/01/2024 20:59:00	South Africa's genocide case against Israel: Both sides play heavy on emotion in ICJ hearing - BBC News	The UN's top legal body has now heard two days of powerful legal argument on the "crime of all crimes": genocide.It is now for the judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to decide whether Israel, in its war in Gaza, is guilty of an attempt to "destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, in whole or in part," as defined by the 1948 Convention on Genocide.There could hardly be a more weighty matter.Both sides have played heavily on the strong emotions swirling around the conflict that erupted on 7 October last year.Around 1,300 people - most of them civilians - were killed and about 240 others were taken hostage during the Hamas attack on southern Israel.More than 23,350 people have been killed - mostly children and women - during Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The case, brought to the ICJ by South Africa, included a litany of alleged Israeli offences, from the indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians to the wholesale destruction of Gaza's infrastructure."This killing is nothing short of destruction of Palestinian life," said one of South Africa's lawyers, Adila Hassin.Israel's war in Gaza could not be allowed to continue, the South African team argued."Entire multi-generational families will be obliterated," Irish barrister Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh warned, "and yet more Palestinian children will become WCNSF - Wounded Child No Surviving Family - the terrible new acronym borne out of Israel's genocidal assault."But on Friday morning Israel hit back, with a mixture of its own emotion and a forensic assault on the South African case.Images of 132 missing Israelis - most of them still being held hostage in Gaza - were shown to the court."Is there a reason these people on your screen are unworthy of protection," Tal Becker, a hugely experienced legal adviser at Israel's Foreign Ministry, asked the court.Mr Becker and his colleagues were scathing about South Africa's submission, arguing that if anyone was guilty of genocide, it was Hamas."Under the guise of the allegation against Israel of genocide," Mr Becker said, "this court is asked to call for an end to operations against the ongoing attacks of an organisation that pursues an actual genocidal agenda".South Africa, the Israelis said, is guilty of supporting Hamas, a group designated as a terrorist organisation by 41 countries, including the US, EU and UK.During his speech, Professor Malcolm Shaw briefly seemed to imply that the very country bringing this case against Israel was itself complicit."South Africa has given succour and support to Hamas, at least," he said.It will probably take the ICJ several years to reach its verdict on the charge of genocide.The South Africans must know there's a legal mountain to climb to prove their case.Genocide is notoriously difficult to prove. There needs to be compelling evidence of intent by those actually in charge of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, as well as a pattern of behaviour by the Israel Defense Forces that cannot reasonably be explained as anything other than genocidal.Remember: this is only about genocide, not whether war crimes have been committed in Gaza, or even whether Israel is engaged in ethnic cleansing, as some allege.It's one thing to be horrified, even enraged, by countless images of the suffering inflicted on the Palestinians.It's quite another to conclude that the killing of 1% of the Gazan population, sobering though that number is, represents an Israeli effort to destroy the Palestinian people, "in whole or in part".But for Israel, which may feel it's on safe ground when it comes to the "crime of all crimes", there's a more immediate concern.South Africa has appealed to the ICJ to issue nine "provisional measures", designed, in the words of South Africa's 84-page submission, "to protect against further, severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people".The first of these calls on Israel to "immediately suspend its military operation in and against Gaza".If obeyed, it would have the effect of bringing Israel's military campaign to a halt.This could happen within weeks, long before Israel feels it has achieved its military objective of utterly destroying Hamas as a political and military force in Gaza.For this reason, its lawyers attempted to demolish South Africa's case for "provisional measures", arguing that they had no legal basis and would tie Israel's hands but leave Hamas free to act.Israel doesn't like the ICJ, and feels that the UN as a whole is inherently biased against the Jewish state.But at a time when international pressure is mounting on Israel to put an end to the huge level of violence in Gaza, it knows that if the court agrees to issue provisional measures, that pressure will only increase.It's prepared to ignore the court if it feels it has to (and the ICJ has no powers of enforcement), but it would much prefer to win the legal argument.	
12/01/2024 20:57:00	Medicine to be delivered to Gaza hostages under new agreement, says Israeli PM - BBC News	A new agreement will allow medicines to be delivered to Israeli hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza, says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It comes after some hostage's families visited Qatar and told mediators loved ones needed important prescription medication, CBS News reports.Deliveries have not begun yet, and it is not clear how medicine will be transported. Israel believes there are around 105 hostages still alive in Gaza.An estimated 240 people were taken prisoner in Hamas's 7 October attacks, but 105 were later released by Hamas during a six-day ceasefire at the end of November, and at least 25 are believed to be dead. Both Hamas and Israel have shown willingness to allow the medicines to reach hostages, reports the BBC's international partner, CBS News, quoting a diplomatic source. Mediators are working with the two sides and with international NGOs to understand which medications are needed, how many, and how they can be delivered, the source adds. According to a statement from the Israeli prime minister's office on Friday, the medicine will be delivered in the next few days. The statement also said the deal was brokered after David Barnea, director of Israel's national intelligence agency Mossad, approached Qatar. A Palestinian official told the BBC there had been discussions about bringing medical aid into Gaza, part of which covered "the needs of the Israeli hostages in Gaza". In a letter sent to the Israeli war cabinet after the ceasefire ended last year, the Hostages Families HQ group said they had "solid intelligence that there are abductees whose condition has deteriorated and are now in immediate danger".They said at least a third of the hostages were suffering from underlying illnesses and needed regular medical treatment - and going without such treatment was dangerous.Since the 7 October attacks, more than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during retaliatory military action by Israel, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Israel says around 1,300 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the Hamas attack. 	
12/01/2024 18:39:00	FM calls for UK parliament recall over Yemen air strikes - BBC News	Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf has called for the UK parliament to be recalled over the air strikes in Yemen.The UK and US strikes against Houthi rebel sites have been described by Rishi Sunak as "necessary and proportionate" to protect the global shipping in the Red Sea.The targeted strikes on military facilities took place overnight.Humza Yousaf said there were "significant questions" to be asked and answered about military action.He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: "Let there be no equivocation that the SNP align ourselves with the UN security resolution, which is essentially calling for the Houthi rebels to stop their attacks in the Red Sea."But of course the UK's record on military intervention, particularly in the Middle East, is not a good one."Before action was taken, the correct and appropriate thing to have done would have been to have recalled parliament, who have given serious detail about any proposed military action."He added: "There are significant questions around the action taken. What is the end goal? What will be deemed as a success?"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the strikes against the Iranian-backed group, who he accuses of threatening UK ships, was in "self-defence".In response, Houthi officials have warned that the UK and US will "pay a heavy price".The US-led strikes are the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping in the Red Sea last year.The Houthis control much of Yemen and say they are supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel.More than 60 targets at 16 locations used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen were struck, the US Air Force said.Mr Sunak accused the Houthi rebels of threatening UK and international ships and causing major disruption to the trade route."Despite the repeated warnings from the international community, the Houthis have continued to carry out attacks in the Red Sea, including against UK and US warships just this week, " the prime minister said."This cannot stand. The United Kingdom will always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade."The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Royal Air Force typhoons conducted two precision strikes on Houthi sites, including an airfield used to launch drones and missiles over the Red Sea and another site used to launch attack drones.Responding to the attacks, a Houthi leader warned the US and UK will "soon realise" that the strikes on Yemen were "the greatest folly in their history".The group maintains they will continue attacking ships in the Red Sea heading to or associated with Israel.Meanwhile, Mr Yousaf's wife, Nadia El-Nakla, has confirmed her sister-in-law and her four children had escaped Gaza.Her brother is a doctor at Al-Nassar Hospital. He is still in the territory with other relatives.Ms El-Nakla's parents returned to Scotland in November after being trapped in Gaza for four weeks when the war with Israel broke out during a family visit.In a statement she said: "I'm pleased that my sister-in-law, Doaa, and their four children have escaped from Gaza, and are now safe."However, my brother Mohamed remains there along with my 93-year-old grandmother and many wider family members."Ms El Nakla, who is a Dundee councillor, said families in Gaza were "still suffering after the loss of entirely innocent men, women and children".She urged the UK government to launch a resettlement scheme for Palestinians, similar to the Ukraine Family Scheme visa.She added: "I will continue to raise my voice to stop the killing and suffering of the innocent people of Gaza, and call for an immediate and urgent ceasefire."A UK government spokesperson said: "Over 300 British nationals and their dependants have so far left Gaza, and we are working around the clock to get the rest of those out who want to leave. "We have a team on the ground in Cairo and at the Rafah crossing as required to provide consular assistance."Any dependants of British citizens who need a visa can apply for one.More than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.During the initial Hamas attacks on Israel some 1,300 people were killed - mainly civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.	
12/01/2024 18:12:00	Progressive Democrats fume over Houthi strikes as Republicans offer rare praise - BBC News	Progressive Democrats have harshly criticised the US decision to launch retaliatory strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.They argued, with support from some Republicans, that President Joe Biden violated the US Constitution by not seeking congressional approval first.But several Republicans offered rare praise of the administration, calling it an "overdue" act of deterrence.The president on Thursday called the precision strikes a "defensive action".In a joint statement with coalition partners - the UK, Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands - the White House said it had acted "in accordance with the inherent right of individual and collective self-defense, consistent with the UN charter".Though Mr Biden notified Congress prior to the strikes launched on 16 Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, he did not seek its authorisation.Several progressives in the president's party fumed that his actions violated Article I of the Constitution, which requires that the power to declare war be granted by Congress."This is an unacceptable violation of the Constitution," Pramila Jayapal, chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. "The President needs to come to Congress before launching a strike against the Houthis in Yemen and involving us in another middle east conflict," said California Congressman Ro Khanna. "I will stand up for that regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House.""The people do not want more of our taxpayer dollars going to endless war and the killing of civilians," added Missouri's Cori Bush. "Stop the bombing and do better by us."Even some Republicans added their voice of disapproval."I am potentially fine with striking Yemen to defend critical shipping channel & response to aggression, but why is Congress not making calls to strike a foreign country with pre-meditation? Under what authority was this carried out?" asked Rep Chip Roy of Texas.US presidents, from Barack Obama to Donald Trump, have often carried out strikes without first seeking congressional approval.After Mr Trump ordered the assassination of Iranian spymaster Qasem Soleimani, Mr Biden argued that presidents "should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people".But under the Biden administration, the US military has previously launched strikes in Syria and Iraq without going to Congress.Experts say the legal justification lies with the Authorisation for Use of Military Force (AUMF) resolution passed by Congress in 2001, which the US has used to justify various troop deployments and counter-terrorism operations around the world over the past two decades.Even without the AUMF resolution in effect, some have argued another piece of legislation, the War Powers Resolution of 1973, grants a president broad powers to take military action.Despite the criticism from some elements of Congress, top Republicans and Democrats have backed Mr Biden's decision."I welcome the US and coalition operations against the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists responsible for violently disrupting international commerce in the Red Sea and attacking American vessels," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement on Thursday night."President Biden's decision to use military force against these Iranian proxies is overdue," the top Republican added.  Ben Cardin, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, agreed."I support President Biden's decision to take precise action against these increasingly dangerous provocations that have threatened the interests of the US and our allies, and welcome our coalition partners taking these actions with us," Mr Cardin said. Senior administration officials have made clear that an attack on an American commercial vessel, being escorted by US military vessels on Tuesday, was the tipping point for Thursday night's action.Twenty drones and three missiles were shot down and, had that not happened, officials say the ships could have been sunk, including one that was carrying jet fuel.The fact that this action was clearly telegraphed in both Washington and London is a clear indication that the US and UK governments, along with the other members of what officials in Washington DC call "a coalition of the willing" wanted to minimise any collateral damage and loss of life; degrading facilities and capabilities was, they say, their aim.The Pentagon is expected to give further details of the battle damage assessment in the coming hours and days, but one senior administration official said indications were that they had had "good effects".The concern in Washington has always been the escalation of the Gaza conflict to the wider region, and officials continue to stress that this is their key aim.But they are also acutely aware of the potential commercial damage to the world economy should shipping continue to come under fire in the route through the Red Sea and the Suez canal.In his statement on Thursday, Mr Biden said he "will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary".	
12/01/2024 16:34:00	Israel says South Africa distorting the truth in ICJ genocide case - BBC News	Israel has said South Africa has distorted the truth in its case at the International Court of Justice, where it is accusing Israel of genocide.South Africa had presented "a sweeping counter-factual description" of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Israeli lawyer Tal Becker told the ICJ.South Africa says Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in its war in Gaza.It is also asking the court to order Israel to halt its military activity.The ICJ is the United Nations' highest court. Its rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but are not enforceable. Israel delivered its defence to the court a day after South Africa presented its case.Outside the legal battleground of the ICJ, police created cordons to ensure rival groups were kept far apart.  On one side, Palestinian flags were waved beneath a big screen streaming a live feed from the courtroom. Banners were unfurled showing images of Nelson Mandela, referencing parallels drawn by South Africa's legal team between the situation in Gaza and the former apartheid era in South Africa. A few hundred metres away, a symbolic Sabbath table had been laid. Photographs were attached to the back of empty chairs. These show some of the more than 130 Israelis who are still being held hostage by Hamas, which is banned as a terrorist group in the US, UK, EU and elsewhere.South Africa asserts that Israel is in violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention, to which both states are signatories, and which commits parties to prevent genocide from happening.Israel has been waging a war against Hamas, Gaza's ruling group, since 7 October, when hundreds of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel, killing about 1,300 people and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages. Members of the hostages' families were in the ICJ courtroom to hear Israel state its case.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed by Israel in the war.In his opening remarks on Friday, Tal Becker told the court that while the civilian suffering was "tragic", Hamas sought "to maximise civilian harm to both Israelis and Palestinians, even as Israel seeks to minimise it".South Africa, he said, "has regrettably put before the court a profoundly distorted factual and legal picture, [and] the entirety of its case hinges on a deliberately curated, decontextualised and manipulative description of the reality of current hostilities".Mr Becker accused South Africa of making "an attempt to weaponise the term genocide against Israel".He said South Africa was also seeking "to thwart Israel's inherent right to defend itself" by trying to get the court to order Israel to stop its military operation against Hamas.On Thursday, the court's 17 judges heard advocate of the High Court of South Africa Tembeka Ngcukaitobi describe how Israel's "genocidal intent" was evident "from the way in which [its] military attack is being conducted". Israel had a plan to "destroy" Gaza, he said, which "has been nurtured at the highest level of state".Adila Hassim, also representing South Africa, told the court that "every day there is mounting, irreparable loss of life, property, dignity and humanity for the Palestinian people"."Nothing will stop the suffering, except an order from this court." In its evidence submitted before the hearing, South Africa said Israel's actions were "intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group".The German government issued a statement on Friday, saying it "expressly rejects the accusation of genocide" against Israel, and that the accusation had "no basis whatsoever"."In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Shoah [Holocaust], the Federal Government sees itself as particularly committed to the Convention against Genocide... We firmly oppose [its] political instrumentalisation."Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Germany would speak at the main hearing at the ICJ.A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Sunak believed South Africa's case was "completely unjustified and wrong.""The UK government stands by Israel's clear right to defend itself within the framework of international law," he said.What the ICJ will deliver on the genocide allegation will be only an opinion, although it is being closely watched.A final ruling on this could take years, although the court could rule more quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign.	
12/01/2024 15:39:00	Is the economy facing another energy price shock? - BBC News	Both Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and US President Joe Biden cited the global economic impact of Houthi attacks on Red Sea cargo ships in overnight statements as the reasoning behind military action.The Treasury has modelled scenarios suggesting that disruption in the Red Sea could further shrink the UK economy, risking a recession.The main fear in the Treasury's analyses is of a rise of at least $10 per barrel in the international price of crude oil and a 25% increase in the price of natural gas.Rises such as these have not actually materialised, so far, mainly because of the actions of Saudi Arabia - the major oil producing nation - in soothing global energy markets with price cuts.The US and UK will hope that their overnight strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels will help reverse widespread delays and disruption to Red Sea trading routes, by re-establishing safe passage through the Bab-al-Mandeb Strait into the Suez Canal.But, on the other hand, there is now also a clear pathway of escalation to a wider Middle East conflict. Oil prices had fallen quite significantly before this, helping petrol prices drop below £1.40 a litre to a two-year low. And on Friday, while prices rose by 4%, they are still a relatively manageable $80 per barrel.But disruption to cargo traffic risks spreading from the Red Sea across the Arabian Peninsula to the Strait of Hormuz, another key trading route.On Thursday, Iran's navy seized a US-linked oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman as part of a long-running row between the two nations.If that situation also escalates, another energy shock is possible with the risk of $100 per barrel of oil on the horizon - just as the impact of the Ukraine crisis was fading. Meanwhile, Europe is now much more physically dependent on flows of shipped gas from Qatar, after supplies from Russian pipelines were stopped. European energy majors have been queuing up to do deals with Doha after Russian taps were turned off.Even if physical supplies could be made up from the US - now the world largest exporter of liquified natural gas - the price would surge on any disruption in the Gulf.A serious escalation could further disrupt the global economy, entrenching inflation, just as the world's central banks were pondering turning points and cutting interest rates.It would also mark clear parallels with the 1970s, when two separate geopolitical energy shocks from the Arab-Israeli War and the Iranian Revolution led to prolonged inflation over several years.So action taken to protect the world economy, is even on that basis alone, not without its risks.	
12/01/2024 15:33:00	Rishi Sunak faces call for MP vote on Houthi air strike - BBC News	Rishi Sunak is facing calls for a vote on RAF air strikes against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen, amid concerns over escalation in the Middle East.Downing Street briefed Sir Keir Starmer and Commons' Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle shortly before air strikes began on Thursday evening.Parliament had already risen for the weekend. The Lib Dems, SNP and Plaid Cymru have urged it to be recalled to hold a vote on the military action.Downing Street has said there are "no plans for a retrospective vote" as parliamentary approval is not required for military action.Commons votes have been held on most armed interventions since the 2003 Iraq war, but constitutionally only the prime minister can authorise strikes.Overnight on Thursday, a US-led air strike hit more than 70 targets at 16 locations used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen.The Houthis say five of their members were killed and six others injured. The action was the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping in the Red Sea last year.The airstrike will not go without "punishment or retaliation", the group's leadership have warned.The Houthi movement is a political and military group which controls a large part of Yemen and says it is supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party was "fully supportive" of the military action aimed at preventing attacks on shipping in the Red Sea."I want the prime minister to make a statement as soon as possible, but the principle of taking action against the Houthi rebels is really important," he added.But Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned that the UK and US action could set "the region alight".Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, described the strikes as "a reckless act of escalation" and said it "is utterly disgraceful that Parliament has not even been consulted".Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he had "made representations" to Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden who gave the briefing on Thursday evening, for the Commons "to be informed at the earliest possible opportunity" about the military action.He said he was "happy to facilitate a recall at any time".Scotland's First Minister, and SNP leader, Humza Yousaf said there were "significant questions" to be asked and answered about military action, lending his support for the Westminster parliament to be recalled.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey says his party is "minded to approve" military action in the Yemen but he says it's a matter of principle that the government should seek the approval of parliament. The party is demanding a recall, saying MPs should not be "by-passed"."When it comes to military action and putting military people on the frontline, it is important that MPs take that incredibly seriously and have that debate," the party's foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said.MPs must hear the government's reasoning for the strikes and contingency plans for retaliatory measures because "this could well not be the end of it", she added.The prime minister has said he will make a Commons statement on Monday - after he returns from a visit to Ukraine, but a vote is thought to be unlikely. Asked why he had not recalled Parliament ahead of the military action, Mr Sunak argued the action taken was "limited and necessary".He accused the Houthis of acting "with impunity", and said their behaviour needed to be responded to with a "strong signal that this breach of international law is wrong".In an effort to reassure MPs, Mr Sunak has published a summary of the legal advice which underpinned the military action.Government lawyers said the strikes were legally taken to "downgrade the Houthi's capabilities and deter further attacks".While there is no suggestion that further action is imminent, the BBC understands if another intervention does become necessary, new legal advice will have to be sought.Ministers have told the BBC that the timing of the strikes could not be determined by the UK government alone, as this was a US-led operation.It is likely we will hear calls for a parliamentary vote in advance of any further action - should any be deemed necessary - when MPs meet on Monday.The House of Commons Library suggests that, on the basis of recent military operations, prior approval is now required when military action is taken. But the Institute for Government think tank points out the guidance is "far from clear cut".So, what are the rules?Additional reporting: Chas Geiger	
12/01/2024 15:20:00	What we know about strikes on Houthis and strategy behind them - BBC News	The US and UK have carried out air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen with the aim of deterring attacks on ships passing through the Red Sea.The strikes were also backed by a number of the US and UK's allies.Missiles were launched overnight into Friday, hitting dozens of sites - with some casualties reported.The Houthis say they are not deterred by the attacks, but the US suggests the strikes have damaged the rebel group's military capability.But the group has survived much worse - including years of being targeted by the Saudi Air Force. This is what we know about the US-UK strikes so far.The US says it "executed deliberate strikes on over 60 targets at 16 Iranian-backed Houthi militant locations".The Pentagon described its targets as radar systems, drone storage and launch sites, missile storage and launch facilities and Houthi command and control nodes. Strikes were reported in the Yemen capital Sanaa - which is controlled by the rebels - as well as the Houthi Red Sea port of Hodeidah, Dhamar and the group's north-western stronghold of Saada.According to the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD), the British strikes were in Bani in the north-west - which the MoD said was a drone operational site - and Abbs airfield, which intelligence said was a launching site for missiles and drones.There were 72 strikes in all, according to the Houthis' military spokesman.The Houthi spokesman also said five of its members had been killed and six others injured.The Pentagon said the strikes were on military, not civilian targets using "precision weapons".US President Joe Biden has said he won't hesitate to take further military action if necessary. But the US has also made clear that it does not want to see a widening conflict in the Middle East.That suggests that any future US-led military action, if necessary, would again be limited.Air strikes and long range cruise missiles are the least risky and costly for Mr Biden in an election year. Remember the US has been also using limited airstrikes to target other Iranian backed groups in Iraq and Syria in recent months.But at best it's a deterrent. It will not eliminate the threat. The strikes last night might also have degraded and destroyed some of the Houthi's ability to launch attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.But in public, at least, they remain defiant. They still have the capacity to launch further attacks. The only real option left for the US and UK is then doing more of the same - targeting from a distance. The US has bitter recent experience of more direct military action in the region -  such as putting boots on the ground. The bulk of the firepower came from US jets. The US has an aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, as well as air bases in the region. US Navy warships fired Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles, which are GPS-guided and can be programmed to fly evasively, the US military says.While no specific figures have been given for how many missiles were fired, the US says more than 100 precision-guided munitions "of various types" were used.Meanwhile, the UK said it sent four RAF Typhoons from Cyprus, carrying Paveway IV guided bombs. It has not said how many were released. Though the Royal Navy has two warships in the Red Sea, neither can fire land attack missiles and so would not have been directly involved in the strikes. Reacting to Friday's strikes, the group's leader Mohammed al-Bukhaiti said the US and UK would "soon realise" the action was "the greatest folly in their history"."America and Britain made a mistake in launching the war on Yemen because they did not benefit from their previous experiences," he wrote on social media, adding "every individual in this world is faced with two choices - either to stand with the victims of genocide or to stand with its perpetrators."Another spokesman for the group said the US and UK were wrong to think they could deter Yemen's support for Palestinians.Iran, which backs the Houthis, has condemned the strikes on Yemen as a "clear violation of Yemen's sovereignty and territorial integrity" and a violation of international laws.A US senior administration official at the National Security Council said in a call on Thursday that "Iran is a primary, if not the primary enabler or supporter sponsor of the Houthis", adding that they believe Iran has been "involved in every phase" of these attacks. The Houthis' position on the Red Sea attacks is that they are preventing ships affiliated with Israel from crossing the route - due to events in Gaza.They have previously said that any ship destined for Israel or with Israeli links is a "legitimate target". However, many commercial vessels that have been targeted appear to have no such connection."They are firing indiscriminately on vessels with global ties," the US National Security Council official said. "Most of the ships that have come under attack have nothing whatsoever to do with Israel." Mr Biden said the strikes were in "direct response" to the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea."These attacks have endangered US personnel, civilian mariners, and our partners, jeopardised trade, and threatened freedom of navigation," he said.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak added that the action was "necessary and proportionate" to protect global shipping."Despite the repeated warnings from the international community, the Houthis have continued to carry out attacks in the Red Sea, including against UK and US warships just this week," he said. "This cannot stand."The US-UK attacks were backed by a coalition of Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand and South Korea.The National Security Council official said "close calls", one which recently nearly sunk a ship carrying US jet fuel, has caused "over a dozen shipping companies" to reroute vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, increasing costs and affecting the global economy.In a statement, the allies said the multilateral strikes were conducted "in accordance with the inherent right of individual and collective self-defence"."These precision strikes were intended to disrupt and degrade the capabilities the Houthis use to threaten global trade and the lives of international mariners in one of the world's most critical waterways," the statement read.	
12/01/2024 13:39:00	UK and US strikes on Houthi sites in Yemen are self-defence, says Rishi Sunak - BBC News	The UK has acted in self-defence attacking Houthi sites in Yemen, Rishi Sunak has said. The UK and US launched targeted strikes on military facilities overnight following attacks by the armed group on ships in the Red Sea. Mr Sunak stressed the action was "necessary, proportionate, and targeted" to protect lives and commercial shipping.In response, Houthi officials warned the UK and US will "pay a heavy price". The US-led strikes are the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping last year. The Houthi movement is a political and military group which controls a large part of Yemen and says it is supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel.More than 60 targets at 16 locations used by Houthis in Yemen were struck, the US Air Force said.Speaking during a visit to Ukraine, the prime minister said the UK "acted in self-defence" following the Houthis' targeting of ships, including a Royal Navy warship on Tuesday. He has called on the group to stop the attacks. "We've seen a significant increase in in the number of Houthi attacks... that's putting innocent lives at risk. It's disrupting the global economy, and it's also destabilising the region," Mr Sunak said."And it's why I made the decision with allies to take what I believe to be necessary, proportionate and targeted action against military targets, to degrade and disrupt Houthi capability."He said: "It's clear that this type of behaviour can't be met without a response, we need to send a strong signal that this breach of international law is wrong." Initial indications are the strikes have been successful, according to the Mr Sunak. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Royal Air Force typhoons conducted two precision strikes on Houthi sites, including an airfield used to launch drones and missiles over the Red Sea and another site used to launch attack drones.Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said there were no further air strikes "immediately planned".The strikes have also been backed by Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was briefed by the government on Thursday night."Clearly the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have to be dealt with," he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast programme.But Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran called for Parliament to be recalled immediately for a retrospective vote on the strikes, and asked if the UK was being drawn into something that risked it being on the frontline in a region she described as a "tinderbox". The SNP have also said any military action should be scrutinised in the Commons. The prime minister said he will make a full statement in Parliament and take questions on Monday. The government has also published a summary of its legal position for the military strikes. It stated the UK was permitted under international law to use force when acting in self-defence. Former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt told the BBC there was responsibility on the UK and US as permanent members of the UN Security Council to take action to protect world trade."One has to hope that this is calculated measured intelligence-led activity, which will have an effect quite quickly and restore international shipping to be able to use the Red Sea as opposed to going around the very expensive Cape of Good Hope route." Former UK national security adviser Lord Ricketts said the strikes on Houthi sites were "inevitable" when the group ignored warnings and following the attack on US and UK naval ships on Tuesday. "I think [the US-led coalition] tried to make it large enough to send a very powerful message but equally being clear its targeted against the attacks on shipping, it's not the declaration of war against the Houthis more generally," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Responding to the attacks, a Houthi leader warned the US and UK will "soon realise" that the strikes on Yemen were "the greatest folly in their history".The group maintains they will continue attacking ships in the Red Sea heading to or associated with Israel. "We affirm that there is absolutely no justification for this aggression against Yemen, as there was no threat to international navigation in the Red and Arabian Seas," spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said.Houthis control north Yemen, capital Sanaa and the Red Sea coastline. The armed group declares themselves to be part of the Iranian-led "axis of resistance" against Israel, the US and wider West. Yemen expert Dr Elisabeth Kendall, from the University of Cambridge, said she did not think Houthis wanted war with the US, but conflict could help them domestically and increase their leverage in talks with Saudi Arabia, which wants to end its nearly decade long conflict with group. "You can do a lot of damage as a small group without very sophisticated weapons when you're sitting at the mouth of ones of the world's most important trade routes," she told BBC News. Russia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council over the strikes. It will take place on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry expressed "great concern" over the air strikes.On Wednesday the UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding an immediate end to Houthi attacks, with the text endorsed the right of UN member states to defend their vessels.Some major shipping lines and oil giant BP have diverted vessels around southern Africa, adding time and costs to journeys.If the crisis continues, the increased costs could be passed on to consumers, hampering efforts to curb inflation and reduce interest rates.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.	
12/01/2024 11:00:00	What do Red Sea assaults mean for global trade? - BBC News	Global supply chains are facing severe disruption as a result of the world's biggest shipping companies diverting journeys away from the Red Sea.Attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen on commercial vessels have resulted in many firms deciding to avoid one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.The Houthi group has declared its support for Hamas and has said it is targeting ships travelling to Israel, though it is not clear if all the ships that have been attacked were actually heading to Israel.US and UK naval forces in the Red Sea have now launched air strikes against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen in response to the attacks on shipping.The Houthis have been stepping up their attacks since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October.The group, which is backed by Iran, has been using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels transporting goods through the strait of Bab al-Mandab - a 20-mile wide channel that splits Eritrea and Djibouti on the African side and Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula.Ships usually take this route from the south to reach Egypt's Suez Canal further north.But because of the attacks and the threat of future assaults, several of the world's largest shipping firms, including Mediterranean Shipping Company and Maersk, have diverted vessels away to a much longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope and then up the west side of the continent.BP has also paused all shipments of oil through the Red Sea, blaming the "deteriorating security situation".The longer journeys add at least 10 days to shipping times and cost companies millions of dollars.Any ship passing through the Suez Canal to or from the Indian Ocean has to come via the strait of Bab al-Mandab and the Red Sea. The Suez Canal is the quickest sea route between Asia and Europe and is particularly important in the transportation of oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG).About nine million barrels of oil per day were shipped through the Suez Canal in the first half of 2023, according to freight analytics firm Vortexa.Analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence said nearly 15% of goods imported into Europe, the Middle East and North Africa were shipped from Asia and the Gulf by sea. That includes 21.5% of refined oil and more than 13% of crude oil.But it is not just about oil. Container ships carry all sorts of consumer goods seen in the shops including TVs, clothes, trainers and sports equipment.It is inevitable that supply chains will be affected due to ships being diverted away from the Red Sea, but consumer goods "will face the largest impact", according to Chris Rogers, head of supply chain research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, though he does note the current disruption has occurred "during the off-peak shipping season".Delays to products reaching shops can be expected, due to the Cape of Good Hope route adding about 3,500 nautical miles.Furniture giant Ikea and UK retailer Next have both warned that supplies of products could be delayed if disruption to shipping continues.Tesla has suspended manufacturing at its only European electric car factory due to supplies being disrupted.The extra distance will also cost companies more. According to supply chain advisers Drewry, the price of using a 40ft container has risen by 15% in the past week. These extra costs could be passed on by businesses to customers.However, container rates are still far below the levels seen in 2021, when freight charges soared in line with demand as Covid restrictions were eased.There are also fears the disruption could push up oil prices.A rise in oil prices, a key ingredient in car fuel, can lead to higher prices at the pumps and also drive higher inflation. Inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, has been falling in the UK and is currently 3.9%.When it comes to shipments of Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) being disrupted, even if wholesale energy prices rise, any increases would not feed through to domestic bills until April 2024 at the earliest.This is because the energy price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge, has already been set for January. Is moving freight by sea the only option? Mr Rogers says transporting goods by rail instead would require "crossing Russia", which is under economic sanctions due to invading Ukraine, while "trucking from the Gulf to Israel may only offset around 3% of shipping".The US had launched an international naval operation in December to try to protect ships on the Red Sea route.This operation was joined by countries including the UK, Canada, France, Bahrain, Norway and Spain, but some shipping companies remained reluctant to start using the route again.Maersk resumed shipments through the Red Sea briefly following the introduction of the security operation, but paused sailings again after one of its container ships came under attack.US and UK naval forces in the Red Sea have now launched air strikes against Houthi rebel targets across Yemen."These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation," US President Joe Biden said.	
12/01/2024 01:02:00	A landmark moment for Rishi Sunak, but uncertainty abounds - BBC News	For Rishi Sunak, strikes against the Houthi rebels mark a landmark moment of his premiership.The decision to commit the UK to military action is a landmark moment in any prime minister's tenure in office. The government has the prerogative to do this without wider political consultation. But in this instance, ministers concluded there was sufficient time to brief the cabinet, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey and Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle before any strikes began. Sir Lindsay and Mr Healey attended a briefing in person in Whitehall. Sir Keir joined the briefing remotely.'I understand the briefing was conducted by the Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden.These conversations are a courtesy. But they are more than a courtesy. Ministers are aware of the scepticism, in parliament and beyond, about the wisdom, or lack of it attached to British military operations over recent decades. Take the Conservative MP Neil O'Brien, until very recently a minister himself.Writing on social media, he said: "Given our main interventions of the last 25 years have been failures, let's be clear up front: What counts as success? Realistically, how far [would] we need to go to achieve this? How will we avoid being dragged into something we don't want?"For his part, the prime minister said in a statement that the Houthi attacks "cannot stand".He continued: "The United Kingdom will always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade. We have therefore taken limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defence".And it is likely there will be a statement and a debate in the Commons, perhaps on Monday, with the government pressed to elaborate on just these kind of points: what it hopes to achieve, by when and at what cost. Not soon enough, some will argue. We have already heard from the Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru.The Lib Dems and Plaid say it is wrong that parliament has been bypassed.The SNP leader in Westminster, Stephen Flynn, said: "It is incumbent upon the UK Government to appraise Parliament as soon as possible and MPs must therefore be recalled to Westminster".This moment has looked increasingly likely: a military response to match the rhetoric threatening just that. It was impossible not to join the dots when Defence Secretary Grant Shapps was asked on Wednesday about the prospect of military action against Houthis and said: "Watch this space."He could have ducked the question. He instead implied something was coming.So, what next, diplomatically, geopolitically, militarily and economically?There are risks associated with action. And risks associated with doing nothing. The risk of a wider conflict in the Middle East? A further shrivelling of shipping traffic through the Red Sea, a vital artery of the world economy? Let's see.And all this after the twin global shocks of the war in Ukraine and the Covid pandemic. More uncertainty beckons; unknown consequences abound.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.	
11/01/2024 23:31:00	Oil prices rise after Iran seizes tanker - BBC News	Oil prices have risen after Iran seized a tanker off the coast of Oman, raising concerns fuel prices could increase.The oil tanker was heading for Turkey on Thursday when armed men ordered it to sail to an Iranian port.The price of Brent crude oil jumped by more than 2%, to $78.40 a barrel following the incident. Meanwhile, the UK government has modelled scenarios suggesting the disruption in the Red Sea could further shrink the British economy.The BBC understands the Treasury has considered a rise of at least $10 (around £7.83) per barrel in the international price of crude oil and a 25% increase in the price of natural gas.Europe, in particular, is now more dependent on exports of gas coming through the Gulf and the Straits of Hormuz. The seizure of the oil tanker by Iran, reported by local state media as retaliation for the hijacking last year of the same vessel by the US, raises prospects of growing conflict in the Middle East, which could have a knock-on effect on UK fuel prices.A rise in oil prices can lead to higher prices at the pumps and also drive higher inflation. Inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, has been falling in the UK and is currently 3.9%.The average price of a litre fell below £1.40 on Thursday for the first time since October 2021, according to motoring group, the AA. Diesel now averages 147.83p a litre across the country, down to a level last seen in early August.This time last year, petrol and diesel averaged 149.47p and 171.93p a litre respectively."Drivers should be ready for pump price volatility, perhaps even a shock, but current pump prices are a huge relief for consumers and inflationary pressures," the AA's Luke Jones added. This most recent incident appears to be separate from attacks carried out by Houthi rebels from Yemen in the Red Sea, on the opposite side of the Arabian peninsula.But as Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics points out, the reaction in the oil market has been fairly muted to these attacks and the Israel-Hamas war."Initially, when the war broke out, there were fears that some of the major oil producers in the region - particularly Iran, but also Saudi Arabia - would become actively involved," she said.However, this no longer appears as likely and the risk of disruption to oil supply has been reduced. Demand for oil has dropped, following the slowdown in the EU and US economies and lack of growth in China, so there is less fear of supply shortfalls. Conversely, there has been a "surprisingly strong growth in US oil production in 2023 and in some other non-OPEC producers such as Brazil and Guyana," Ms Bain said, which has "allayed fears of disruption to Middle East supply."  "If there were a further escalation in tensions in the Middle East/Red Sea, I think prices would rise more markedly," she added. 	
11/01/2024 20:49:00	Gaza journalists’ families reject Israeli military's ‘terrorist’ claims - BBC News	The families of the two Palestinian journalists killed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza have rejected as "fabricated" and "false" a new claim from Israel's military that they were "terrorists". The Qatar-based Al Jazeera news network, for whom one of the journalists worked, also condemned what it called the "false and misleading attempts to justify the killing of our colleagues".Hamza al-Dahdouh, an Al Jazeera journalist and cameraman, and Mustafa Thuraya, a freelance videographer, died after their car was hit in the southern city of Rafah on Sunday. A third journalist was reportedly seriously injured. Al Jazeera said at the time that it strongly condemned the "assassination" of the journalists "whilst they were on their way to carry out their duty" during the war between Israel and Hamas.     It also accused Israel of "systematically targeting" Dahdouh's family. His father, Wael, is the network's Gaza bureau chief and he has now lost five members of his immediate family in Israeli strikes.  In an initial statement about Sunday's strike, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it "identified and struck a terrorist who operated an aircraft that posed a threat to IDF troops."   "We are aware of the reports that during the strike, two other suspects who were in the same vehicle as the terrorist were also hit," it added. But, when the IDF's chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari was asked by US network NBC on Monday if it had evidence to support the claims, he appeared to contradict the statement.      "Every journalist that dies it's unfortunate," he said."We understand they were putting a drone, using a drone. And using a drone in a war zone, it's a problem. It looks like the terrorists," he added. "So we will investigate this incident and we will provide the data."NBC also cited Al Jazeera's managing editor Mohamed Moawad as saying that Mustafa Thuraya was a drone operator and that he was driving back to Rafah with Hamza al-Dahdouh after filming the aftermath of an air strike. He added that that they were not flying a drone while travelling.When approached again for a response, the IDF said it had no further comment and referred the BBC to Adm Hagari's NBC interview.   On Wednesday night, the IDF put out another statement about the incident which said an Israeli aircraft targeted the operators of a "hostile drone near Rafah" and that Palestinian media had subsequently identified them as journalists."However, IDF intelligence has confirmed that both the deceased were members of Gaza-based terrorist organizations actively involved in attacks against IDF forces," it added.It alleged that troops in Gaza had found a document that identified Mustafa Thuraya as a "member of Hamas' Gaza City Brigade, serving as squad deputy commander in the Qadisiya Battalion". Troops had also found documents that showed Hamza al-Dahdouh's "role in the Islamic Jihad's electronic engineering unit and his previous role as a deputy commander in the Zeitoun Battalion's Rocket Array", it added. Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) is the second largest armed group in Gaza and, like Hamas, it is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and others. The IDF released a photograph of one document in Arabic that included Hamza al-Dahdouh's name among a list of "operatives from the electronic engineering unit" of PIJ. The image is very poor quality, making it hard to assess its authenticity independently. However, two regional experts told BBC Verify that the use of English alongside Arabic in the document was unusual.Erik Skare, a researcher at France's Sciences Po university who has written a book on PIJ, said: "I regularly visited the website of the al-Quds Brigades... I have read their martyr biographies, their books etc, and I have never seen the combination of English and Arabic text."The IDF did not provide other photo or video evidence about Hamza al-Dahdouh, nor did it release any of the documents that it said showed Mustafa Thuraya's alleged links to Hamas. The BBC asked the IDF to share further evidence, but it said: "At this point we have nothing to add." Asked to comment on the allegations, Hamza al-Dahdouh's family told the BBC on Thursday: "It is clear that these are Israeli fabrications in an attempt to defend themselves and justify the targeting of Hamza and the journalists and divert the issue from its track to make it appear that it is not targeting journalists." "Israel is under international pressure and from the American administration. Israel wants to divert attention and create pretexts," it added. "Hamza has been working as a journalist for many years, and during this war he was doing his journalistic work and was displaced with his colleagues and family like other Palestinians." Mustafa Thuraya's cousin also told the AFP news agency that the IDF's claim was "false".  "He was an ambitious and professional young man who was known among journalists for his work," Mohammed Thuraya said, adding that his cousin had sold photos and videos taken with his drone to local and international news outlets.Al Jazeera Media Network said in a statement sent to the BBC that it "strongly condemns and wholly rejects - and indeed expresses its very considerable surprise at - the Israeli army's false and misleading attempts to justify the killing of our colleague Hamza Wael al-Dahdouh and other journalists"."[Hamza al-Dahdouh] was killed simply for doing his job and for shining a light on events that the Israeli army would rather stayed in the dark and hidden from scrutiny," it added."Al Jazeera rejects all accusations made against our journalists and calls on the international community to ensure that the IDF is held fully accountable for its crimes."Hamza was the eldest son of Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdouh. Wael's wife, Amna, his one-year-old grandson Adam, his 15-year-old son Mahmoud and seven-year-old daughter Sham were killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp in October - a place they had gone to flee the fighting in the north.  Wael was injured in an Israeli drone strike in December that killed his colleague, Al Jazeera cameraman Samer Abudaqa. The pair had been covering the Israeli bombardment at a UN school sheltering displaced people in the southern city of Khan Younis.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has called for an independent investigation into the strike. At least 79 journalists and media workers - 72 Palestinians, four Israelis and three Lebanese - have been killed since the start of the war, according to the group. The conflict was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,300 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage. More than 23,400 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during the 13 weeks of fighting since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. 	
11/01/2024 19:21:00	Israel officials support Gaza destruction, court hears - BBC News	Israel's plan to "destroy" Gaza comes from "the highest level of state", the UN's top court has heard.The claims were made by South African lawyers as it presented its case accusing Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice.South Africa also called on the court to order Israel to cease military operations in Gaza. Israel - which will present its defence on Friday - has vehemently rejected the accusations as "baseless". The court will deliver only an opinion on the genocide allegation, although it is being closely watched.Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, a lawyer for the High Court of South Africa, told the ICJ Israel's "genocidal intent" was evident "from the way in which this military attack is being conducted". "The intent to destroy Gaza has been nurtured at the highest level of state," he said. "Every day there is mounting, irreparable loss of life, property, dignity and humanity for the Palestinian people," Adila Hassim, also representing South Africa, told the court."Nothing will stop the suffering, except an order from this court." In its evidence submitted before the hearing, South Africa said Israel's actions were "intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group".Israel will offer its defence on Friday, but has previously said its actions in the Gaza Strip are justified because it is responding to Hamas's deadly attacks on 7 October. But speaking in court on Thursday, South Africa's Justice Minister Ronald Lamola said that no attack "can provide justification for or defend breaches of the [Genocide] Convention". Israel is a signatory to the Genocide Convention of 1948, which defines genocide and commits states to prevent it.On Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said "the hypocrisy of South Africa screams to the heavens" - criticising the country for failing to respond to atrocities in Syria and Yemen committed by "partners of Hamas". "Today we saw an upside-down world. Israel is accused of genocide while it is fighting against genocide," he added."Israel is fighting murderous terrorists who carried out crimes against humanity." The US, meanwhile, said that it saw no justification for South Africa's allegation that Israel has committed genocide. "They are defending themselves against a still viable threat," said White House national security spokesperson John Kirby.The ICJ is the United Nation's highest court, based in The Hague in the Netherlands. Its rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but are not enforceable. In 2022, the court ordered Russia to "immediately suspend military operations" in Ukraine, an order that was ignored. Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.There were angry scenes outside the ICJ's building, known as the Peace Palace, as Dutch police struggled to keep groups of Palestinian and Israeli supporters apart.Hundreds of people waving Palestinian flags gathered outside the ICJ, calling for a ceasefire. Israeli supporters set up a screen showing images of some of the hostages still being held in Gaza.Red and white police tape has been placed outside the ICJ in an attempt to bring some semblance of order to the chaotic scenes outside. It was in contrast to the formality inside the court, where the Israeli delegation is listening to South Africa's lawyers accuse the country's forces of committing genocide in Gaza. Israel's delegation is expected to highlight its right to self-defence under international law - this week, Mr Netanyahu said Israel had no intention of permanently displacing the people of Gaza, or occupying the territory. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes such as genocide, but its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions.On Wednesday, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said: "Our opposition to the ongoing slaughter of the people of Gaza has driven us as a country to approach the ICJ." Israeli President Isaac Herzog called the accusations "atrocious and preposterous". "We will be in the International Court of Justice and we will present proudly our case of using self-defence… under humanitarian law," he said. He added that the Israeli army was "doing its utmost under extremely complicated circumstances on the ground to make sure that there will be no unintended consequences and no civilian casualties". The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign - but a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take years. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza, and its governing African National Congress has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994.In Gaza, more than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, since the war began in the aftermath of Hamas's 7 October attacks on southern Israel. In those attacks some 1,300 people were killed - mainly civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage. 	
11/01/2024 18:08:00	Iran seizes oil tanker St Nikolas near Oman - BBC News	Iran has seized a Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman. Armed men wearing masks reportedly boarded the vessel St Nikolas, close to the Omani port of Sohar, and ordered it to sail to an Iranian port.Iranian state media, quoting the navy, said the seizure was in retaliation for the ship and oil it had aboard being confiscated by the US last year. The St Nikolas was in transit between the Iraqi port of Basra and its intended destination in Turkey.UK Maritime Trade Operations said on Thursday it had received a report that four to five "unauthorised persons", reportedly wearing "military style black uniforms with black masks", had boarded the ship at 03:30 GMT.They added that communications with the vessel had been lost and the authorities were investigating. Iranian state media quoted the army as saying the vessel is American, although it is Greek-owned.The company that manages it, Empire Navigation, said it was loaded with 145,000 tonnes of crude oil and was carrying 18 Filipinos and one Greek citizen as crew.The St Nikolas was seized in April by the US under its previous name, the Suez Rajan, as part of sanctions enforcement against Iran. Suez Rajan Limited, which formerly chartered the ship, later pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate sanctions by covertly selling and transporting oil abroad on behalf of Iran. The US has called for the immediate release of the vessel and its crew, describing the seizure as the latest attempt by Iran to disrupt international commerce."We believe this kind of action will simply add uncertainty for commercial shipping and for regional and global economies," said US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel. This latest act appears to be separate from attacks carried out by Houthi rebels from Yemen in the Red Sea on the opposite side of the Arabian peninsula.Thursday's incident was in a different ocean from the Houthis' usual area of operations - where they have been attacking any ships they suspect of being linked to Israel in retaliation for the country's actions in Gaza. The US and UK have hinted they could take military action against Yemen's Houthi rebels following the largest attack yet.Carrier-based jets and warships shot down 21 drones and missiles launched by the Iran-backed group on Tuesday night.The UN Security Council passed a resolution on Wednesday demanding an immediate end to the Houthi attacks.	
11/01/2024 13:22:00	'Deep concern' for patients and staff at Gaza's al-Aqsa hospital - BBC News	Doctors from the UK who have been working at what they say is the only functioning hospital in the central Gaza Strip have told the BBC of their "deep concern" for patients and staff remaining there - as fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas has reportedly intensified in nearby areas.Deborah Harrington, an obstetrician who has been working at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah with the British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), said the fighting meant there has been "a real decrease" in the number of staff able to work at the facility over the past two weeks.At the same time, she said some 600 to 700 patients were still being treated inside the hospital daily, and that hundreds of displaced people were sheltering there or in the immediate vicinity."Without any functioning or sufficient healthcare staff, it will be an unmitigated disaster for those people living in Middle Gaza," another member of the team, surgeon Nick Maynard, told the BBC.When asked about the reports, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC: "The forces closest to there are 1.5km (0.9 miles) away and there is no activity there."Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. Any military operation around hospitals must take steps to spare patients, medical staff and other civilians inside them.On Sunday, MAP and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) announced that their staff had been "forced to withdraw and cease activities" as a result of what they called "increasing Israeli military activity around the al-Aqsa Hospital".The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also said it had "received troubling reports of increasing hostilities and ongoing evacuation orders near the vital al-Aqsa hospital... which according to the facility's director forced over 600 patients and most health workers to leave".He stated that al-Aqsa was "the most important hospital remaining in Gaza's Middle Area and must remain functional, and protected, to deliver its lifesaving services"."Further erosion of its functionality cannot be permitted - doing so in the face of such trauma, injury and humanitarian suffering would be a moral and medical outrage," he warned.Speaking to the BBC from Cairo airport, Mr Maynard, a senior surgeon and clinical lead with MAP who worked at al-Aqsa's surgical unit for two weeks, said he and his team were told to evacuate from Gaza last Friday."I was operating on a serious blast injury during the day, and at about 15:00 I finished in theatres to come out to find that there had been an attack on the intensive care unit (ICU)." He added: "We were told we had to leave."Two other doctors said they had been told of an incident at the ICU, and had later seen pictures shared on social media of a bullet embedded into the ICU building's wall - but none of them witnessed the incident themselves. The BBC was not able to verify the reports. Asked about the incident specifically, the IDF said it was "not aware of an air strike regarding the incident in question".Another doctor placed at al-Aqsa with MAP, James Smith, told the BBC that he had heard gunfire on several days."It's worth stressing that the sound would travel, so it was maybe 1km or 2km (0.6-1.2 miles) away," he said, adding that it could occasionally be heard from the hospital courtyard. Shelling was reported in the vicinity of the hospital on Tuesday, the UN said.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza also reported that 57 dead and 65 injured people had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital over the previous 24 hours but provided no further details.And on Wednesday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said six people had been killed in an Israeli strike that targeted an ambulance on the outskirts of Deir al-Balah. Four of those killed were PRCS team members while the two others were in the ambulance at the time, it added.The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the strike was in the vicinity of al-Aqsa hospital and that a journalist was also among the dead. The IDF said in a statement on Thursday that "a review was conducted based on the details provided to the IDF which shows that no strike was carried out in the described area". "The IDF is committed to international law and takes all feasible measures in order to mitigate civilian harm," it added.The BBC has verified footage posted on social media in recent days, in which plumes of smoke and the sound of gunshots can be heard in the surrounding area - though we could not verify where the shots were coming from and who was firing.Pictures posted on social media also showed leaflets apparently dropped by the IDF, which warned residents of several neighbourhoods to the north that they were now in a "dangerous combat zone" and called on them to urgently evacuate for their own safety. They did not include the area directly around al-Aqsa hospital.The doctors the BBC spoke to also said they were told about the leaflets, but had not seen them themselves.Sean Casey, a WHO emergency medical teams co-ordinator who visited al-Aqsa hospital on the weekend, said the facility was now near an evacuation zone.The IDF said "no specific evacuation notice had been given to" al-Aqsa.Dr Harrington said two nurses who worked at al-Aqsa's emergency room had been killed in the last two weeks as a result of fighting, while another staff member who had already been displaced once had her house bombed. Dr Smith said: "Many Palestinian healthcare workers have expressed that they have felt that it is too unsafe to go back to the hospital."Certainly some people I've been in touch with haven't gone back since Friday."He added that he and his colleagues remained concerned for those still in the hospital."There are many patients who physically cannot move, the elderly, people with disabilities, many patients on the neo-natal unit, many people recovering post-operative care who cannot move, and thousands of internally displaced people living within the hospital compound or in the immediate vicinity of the hospital."Some people may find the details and image below distressing. The text graphically describes fatal injuries suffered by children brought to the hospital.The three doctors from the UK said they witnessed "horrific" injuries and challenging conditions inside al-Aqsa hospital."We had no running water in theatres, so we had no ability to scrub up and wash," Mr Maynard said of the surgical unit. "We just had to use alcohol gel before operating.""There were no drapes to cover the patients in theatres, so we had to use makeshift gowns to try to keep the patients sterile and clean. "Instruments were limited, there were very limited sutures for stitching," he added.Recalling what the emergency room was like to work in, Dr Harrington said: "There were often no trolleys, so we were managing patients on the floor, which is filthy, which is cold."Sometimes oxygen tubing couldn't even reach those patients. We were putting in chest drains in completely unsanitary conditions, affording patients no dignity."She said there was often no morphine or other pain relief."I can't get out of my mind - a child came in alive, literally burnt to the bone, their hands were contracting. Their face was just charcoal, and they were alive and talking. And we had no morphine," she said."I won't be able to wipe that memory and the smell, being treated on the floor."Dr Smith, an emergency doctor, also described how many patients arrived with "horrific, traumatic injuries", ranging from burns to amputations and serious shrapnel injuries."We saw people with traumatic amputations. I saw a child, around one year old, who had had two limbs traumatically amputated, and the other two were severely damaged."The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update that "intense Israeli bombardments from air, land, and sea" continued across much of Gaza on Tuesday, particularly in the Deir al-Balah southern Khan Younis areas. "The offensive in these areas results in the killing and injury of many people and having devastating consequences for tens of thousands of civilians, many of whom had already fled for safety from Gaza City and the north to central and southern Gaza," it warned.Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to "eradicate" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group. It says it tries to avoid harm to civilians and blames Hamas for embedding fighters among them.The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,300 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.More than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during the 13 weeks of fighting since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.	
11/01/2024 04:15:00	US and UK hint at military action after largest Houthi attack in Red Sea - BBC News	The US and UK have hinted they could take military action against Yemen's Houthi rebels, after they repelled the largest attack yet on Red Sea shipping.Carrier-based jets and warships shot down 21 drones and missiles launched by the Iran-backed group on Tuesday night.The UN Security Council passed a resolution on Wednesday demanding an immediate end to the Houthi attacks.The text endorsed the right of UN member states to defend their vessels. The Houthis reacted scornfully to it.Their spokesman Mohammed Ali al-Houthi called the resolution a "political game".  They claim to be targeting Israeli-linked vessels, in protest at Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.The UN resolution demanded "that the Houthis immediately cease all such attacks, which impede global commerce and undermine navigational rights and freedoms as well as regional peace and security". Eleven nations voted for it, but Russia, China, Mozambique and Algeria abstained.Earlier, the US and several allies warned of "consequences" for the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. Asked about potential strikes in Yemen, UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said: "Watch this space."The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead.The Houthis said they targeted a US ship on Tuesday providing support to Israel. It was the 26th attack on commercial shipping in the Red Sea since 19 November.The US military said Iranian-designed one-way attack drones, anti-ship cruise missiles and anti-ship ballistic missiles were launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen at around 21:15 local time (18:15 GMT).Eighteen drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile were shot down by F/A-18 warplanes from the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D Eisenhower, which is deployed in the Red Sea, and by four destroyers, the USS Gravely, USS Laboon, USS Mason and HMS Diamond.HMS Diamond shot down seven of the Houthi drones using its guns and Sea Viper missiles, each costing more than £1m ($1.3m), a defence source said.No injuries or damage were reported.Later, Houthi military spokesman Yahya al-Sarea confirmed its forces had carried out an operation involving "a large number of ballistic and naval missiles and drones". "It targeted a US ship that was providing support for the Zionist entity [Israel]," he said. "The operation came as an initial response to the treacherous assault on our naval forces by the US enemy forces," he added, referring to the sinking of three Houthi speed boats and killing of their crews by US Navy helicopters during an attempted attack on a container ship on 31 December. He added that the rebels would "not hesitate to adequately deal with all hostile threats as part of the legitimate right to defend our country, people and nation".Mr Sarea also reiterated that the Houthis would continue to "prevent Israeli ships or ships heading towards occupied Palestine from navigating in both the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea until the [Israeli] aggression [on Gaza] has come to an end and the blockade has been lifted".A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was "very concerned" because of the risks the situation posed to global trade, the environment and lives, as well as the "risk of the escalation of the broader conflict in the Middle East".Mr Shapps warned on Wednesday that the UK and its allies had "previously made clear that these illegal attacks are completely unacceptable and if continued the Houthis will bear the consequences"."We will take the action needed to protect innocent lives and the global economy," he added.Later, the defence secretary said in a TV interview that Iran was "behind so much of the bad things happening in the region" and warned the Islamic Republic and the Houthis that there would be "consequences" if the attacks on shipping did not stop.Asked if there could be Western military action against Houthi targets in Yemen, or even targets inside Iran, he replied: "I can't go into details but can say the joint statement we issued set out a very clear path that if this doesn't stop then action will be taken. So, I'm afraid the simplest thing to say [is] 'watch this space'."He was referring to a statement put out a week ago by the UK, US, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea and Singapore, who launched "Operation Prosperity Guardian" last month to protect Red Sea shipping.They said the attacks posed "a direct threat to the freedom of navigation that serves as the bedrock of global trade in one of the world's most critical waterways".It may not have had the bravado of Mr Shapps' "watch this space" warning, but US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also clear in his condemnation of the incident.Speaking to reporters at an airport in Bahrain during a Middle East tour, he was pressed by BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher about whether it was time that talk of consequences turned to US action. Mr Blinken responded that he did not want to "telegraph" a US military move, but that he had spent the past four days in the region warning the Houthis to cease their aggression.They have not only refused, but after this latest strike have claimed they are specifically targeting US ships.Almost 15% of global seaborne trade passes through the Red Sea, which is linked to the Mediterranean by the Suez canal and is the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia.The fear is that fuel prices will rise and supply chains will be damaged. The Houthis say they have been targeting Israeli-owned or Israel-bound vessels to show their support for the Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas since the start of the war in Gaza in October.Formally known as the Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), the Houthis began as a movement that championed Yemen's Zaidi Shia Muslim minority.In 2014, they took control of the capital, Sanaa, and seized large parts of western Yemen the following year, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene in support of the international-recognised Yemeni government. The ensuing war has reportedly killed more than 150,000 people and left 21 million others in need of humanitarian assistance.Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of smuggling weapons, including drones and cruise and ballistic missiles, to the Houthis in violation of a UN arms embargo. Iran has denied the allegation.	
10/01/2024 23:12:00	Hard choices for the West in Red Sea stand-off - BBC News	The mass attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels against vessels in the Red Sea on 9 January was their biggest yet and it signals two things. Firstly, the Iranian-backed Houthis, who control their country's Red Sea coastline, are not backing down in the face of international pressure. Secondly, they clearly have a powerful arsenal of missiles and drones and they are not afraid to launch them at Western warships.In the event, all 21 drones and missiles were shot down by a combination of US Navy F/A-18 fighter jets and missiles launched from US and British warships. But this is expensive, very expensive, and the Houthis know it. A basic Houthi explosive drone costs just under £16,000, while a Sea Viper missile of the sort carried by HMS Diamond costs in excess of £1m. Then there are all the fuel and other costs of maintaining the multinational US-led flotilla of warships under the banner of Operation Prosperity Guardian."It's clearly not practical in the long term, either logistically or economically," says Royal Navy Rear Adm (retd) John Gower, "to combat a mixture of medium and low-cost missiles and drones with very expensive high-end interceptor missiles."The risks, too, are mounting.Older US Navy officers will not have forgotten the humiliation of al-Qaeda's attack on the USS Cole in Aden harbour in 2000. Using a simple speedboat packed with explosives, al-Qaeda suicide bombers rammed it into the side of that billion-dollar warship, crippling the ship and killing 17 US sailors. Onboard close-range defences have improved since then, but Western warships are not impregnable. Iran, which arms, trains and supports the Houthis, has specialised in the doctrine of "swarm attacks", whereby they or their allies will attempt to overwhelm the air defences of their enemy by simultaneously launching a large number of drones or missiles. This is what the Russians have been doing in Ukraine, with partial success, using Iranian-supplied drones coupled with more sophisticated missiles.In the case of Western warships protecting shipping in the Red Sea, Adm Gower warns that "the supply of [US and British] missiles onboard is probably more limited than those available to the Houthi militia. A lower-scale, longer-term attritional approach by the Houthis would soon cause logistical headaches."A new report published on Wednesday by the Whitehall think tank Rusi details some of the more sophisticated weaponry available to the Houthis. Its authors say this includes the 400-km range Asef Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile (ASBM), which carries a 500kg warhead and uses an electro-optical seeker to home in on its target. Then there is the Al-Mandeb 2, an anti-ship cruise missile similar to the one fired by Hezbollah in 2006 against the Israeli ship Hanit.The Rusi report asserts that the Houthis are getting tipped off about shipping movements by an Iranian surveillance ship, the MV Behshad, operating in the lower Red Sea, close to the narrow Bab al-Mandab Strait, through which about 15% of global trade normally passes. The recent attacks by the Houthis have forced a growing number of shipping companies to reroute their vessels all the way round the western coast of Africa, adding days, fuel and costs to the journey.Centcom, the division of the US Department of Defense that deals with the Middle East, will have already drawn up detailed strike plans for destroying a range of Houthi military targets along the coast. So given how most of the world deplores the Houthi attacks on shipping, why doesn't the US and its allies take action to stop them?Here's why they are hesitating.The Houthis, formally known as Ansar Allah, or "Partisans of God", have professed themselves to have joined the Gaza war on the side of Hamas. They claim, inaccurately, to be targeting only shipping that is calling at Israeli ports or those vessels with Israeli links to their ownership.This stance, while massively unwelcome to global shipping and trade, is going down very well with their own population and across the wider Middle East, where the popular Arab consensus is that the US is part of the problem because it is feeding Israel's war machine and it has been blocking a ceasefire in Gaza. Arab populations are also dismissive of their own governments' inability to stop the slaughter in Gaza. So much as those governments dislike the Houthis and their Iranian backers, they - with the exception of Bahrain - dare not risk triggering popular unrest by joining any military action against the Houthis.Any US-led attack on Houthi missile launch sites, storage facilities, naval dockyards or command and control centres would undoubtedly be portrayed as "a US-Israeli attack on the Arab nation".It would risk inflaming the Israel-Hamas war well beyond its current borders and spark a conflict with Iran which the US is keen to avoid.The Saudis find themselves in an especially delicate position. They have been busy trying to extract themselves from a disastrous civil war in Yemen that they joined in with air strikes against the Houthis in 2015. An estimated 150,000 people have been killed there since then.Not only did the Saudis and their UAE allies fail to reverse the Houthis' illegal takeover of the country, but the Houthis hit back with missile and drone strikes of their own, targeting Saudi airports, cities and petrochemical facilities. According to Rusi, they launched 340 missiles and drones at Saudi Arabia in March 2021 alone. Today, there is a fragile truce in Yemen and the Saudis have no wish to derail that.The Saudi leadership is also acutely aware of how popular the Houthi stand is with some of their own population. As graphic TV reports are beamed in daily of funerals and grieving families in Gaza, the notion of an anti-Western, anti-Israel militia standing up and being part of an "axis of resistance" strikes a chord with many Saudis and other Arabs. Should Riyadh side with the US in the Red Sea, it would risk being seen as siding with Israel.Given all the above factors, the US, the West and all the other nations taking part in the multinational operation to protect shipping in the Red Sea would much rather the Houthis simply back down in the face of overwhelming firepower. But that shows no sign of happening, so unless they can be persuaded otherwise, then some sort of limited military action against Houthi facilities may now be imminent.	
10/01/2024 21:38:00	Eurovision: Finnish artists want Israel barred from contest over Gaza war - BBC News	More than 1,400 Finnish music industry professionals have signed a petition urging a ban on Israel from Eurovision over alleged "war crimes" in Gaza.If Israel is not excluded from the competition, they want public broadcaster Yle to withdraw Finland's entry from the competition.Yle says it is monitoring the position of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the organiser of the contest.Last month, Icelandic musicians made similar demands to broadcaster Rúv.Lukas Korpelainen, one of the petition's authors, told newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet it was not acceptable for Israel to "take part in the Eurovision Song Contest to polish its image".Signatories include Finnish artists Olavi Uusivirta, Paleface and Axel Ehnström, who represented the country in the 2011 contest.They accuse Yle of double standards, saying the broadcaster was among the first to demand a ban on Russia from the 2022 contest, "and we expect the same active defending of values from Yle now as well".A day after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Yle representative Ville Vilén said Moscow's attack was "contrary to all the values that Yle and other European broadcasters represent".The EBU soon after banned Russia from participating.Mr Vilén said the situation in Israel and Gaza was "not quite the same"."As gruesome as it is, it is not a war of inter-state aggression like between Russia and Ukraine," he told Finnish tabloid Ilta-Sanomat last month.Yle's head of communications Jere Nurminen told Hufvudstadsbladet the company was following the situation and talking to the EBU and other public broadcasters.Yle also plans to meet the petition's authors.In December the EBU released a statement saying that Eurovision was "for broadcasters - not for governments" and Israel had taken part for 50 years.It said member organisations had agreed that Israel's public broadcaster Kan "complies with all competition rules" and insisted the contest was a "non-political event".When approached by the BBC, Kan declined to comment. This year's Eurovision will take place in the Swedish city of Malmö, with the United Kingdom represented by pop star Olly Alexander.After it emerged that Alexander had endorsed a statement accusing Israel of genocide, an Israeli official told the UK's Telegraph newspaper the arguments were "absurd" and accused signatories of "anti-Israel bias".More than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's military campaign - mostly women and children - according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.The war was triggered after an attack by gunmen belonging to Hamas - which is classed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other Western governments - on southern Israel. About 1,300 people - most of them civilians - were killed, with about 240 others taken hostage.Israel launched retaliatory air strikes on Gaza before mounting a ground operation with the stated aim of "destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities" as well as freeing the hostages.Since the war began, Israel has drastically reduced the amount of food, water, medical supplies and fuel allowed into Gaza to try to pressure Hamas. UN agencies say 26% of Gazans - 576,600 people - have exhausted their food supplies and coping capacities and face "catastrophic hunger and starvation".According to Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, 1.9 million Gazan residents - about 85% of the population - have been displaced, and 1.4 million of them are sheltering in its facilities.	
09/01/2024 20:46:00	Israel-Gaza war: Blinken says cost of conflict on children far too high - BBC News	The cost of war on Gaza's civilians is "far too high", US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said. Mr Blinken said Israel needed to remove barriers so more essential aid could be allowed into Gaza.But he said Israel faced a huge challenge in fighting an enemy in Hamas which had embedded itself within the civilian population.Mr Blinken was speaking after meeting Israeli leaders on his fourth trip to the country since the conflict began.America's top diplomat told a news conference in Tel Aviv that leaders in the region shared US concerns about the "dire humanitarian situation" on the ground. But he said he had heard a new and powerful message from Israel's neighbours over the last three days. They are willing not only to live with Israel but to integrate the region in a way that makes everyone secure, including Israel, Mr Blinken said. In other words, talk of diplomatic normalisation with Israel - which had appeared to be derailed by the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel - is on the table.That, he said, would require some hard decisions and hard choices - which include Israel agreeing to a "clear pathway to the realisation of Palestinian political rights and a Palestinian state" which he said was vital for long-term peace. Mr Blinken would not be drawn on whether this was something Israel would consider. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously voiced his staunch opposition to such a state, citing security concerns. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in response to a cross-border assault by Hamas - designated a terrorist organisation by Israel and many western nations including the US. 1,300 people were killed in the attacks.Since then, more than 23,200 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.When asked about whether there was any evidence that Israel was de-escalating its military campaign in Gaza, Mr Blinken answered that no one in the region - including the Israelis - wanted the conflict to escalate. That may be reassuring for many worried about the conflict spreading, but he gave no indication that Israel told him it was winding down its military operations anytime soon. In recent weeks, Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based organisation designated a terrorist group by the US, has increased rocket fire into northern Israel.Yemeni Houthi rebels have also attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea - one of the world's most important trading routes. The Houthis, Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran. Mr Blinken's meetings in Israel on Tuesday were not entirely without tangible results. He announced that the US and Israel agreed on a plan for the UN to conduct an "assessment mission" that would be the first step toward allowing Palestinians to return to the areas of northern Gaza that have been devastated by the Israeli offensive.Even here, however, Mr Blinken warned that their return would not happen "overnight". Too much has to be done to clear the area of unexploded ordinance and booby traps, as well as to ensure supporting infrastructure is in place.Mr Blinken also told the press conference that South African claims that Israel was committing genocide, filed at the International Court of Justice, were "meritless".But he said: "The daily toll on civilians in Gaza, particularly on children, is far too high."He cited UN figures that 90% of the population continued to face severe food insecurity, adding: "For children, the effects of long periods without sufficient food can have lifelong consequences." "More food, more water, more medicine, other essential goods need to get into Gaza. And then once they're in Gaza, they need to get more effectively to the people who need them."	
09/01/2024 20:06:00	David Cameron worried Israel may have broken international law in Gaza - BBC News	Lord David Cameron has said he is "worried" Israel may have broken international law in Gaza.The foreign secretary said he regularly consulted government lawyers over incidents in the war, but refused to say whether the legal advice suggested Israel had acted illegally.Lord Cameron stressed the government had not changed its support for Israel.Since the outbreak of war following Hamas' attack on 7 October, over 23,000 Palestinians have been killed.The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 59,000 Palestinians have been injured.Israel declared war on Hamas after the group led a massive attack on communities inside Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages.Israel is also fighting a claim from South Africa that it is committing "genocidal" acts in Gaza at the International Court of Justice.Lord Cameron said he did not agree with South Africa's claim.Speaking during his first grilling by MPs since joining the House of Lords, the former prime minister said: "I don't think that is helpful, I don't agree with it, I don't think it's right".During a tense exchange with SNP MP Brendan O'Hara, Lord Cameron said he has seen things "deeply concerning" during the crisis but did not directly criticise the country's actions.He called on Israel to allow in more humanitarian aid and restore water supplies to northern Gaza.But Lord Cameron repeatedly side-stepped questions on whether he had seen legal advice suggesting Israel had breached international law, telling the foreign affairs committee "I don't want to answer that question".He said: "If you're asking me am I worried that Israel has taken action that might be in breach of international law because this particular premises has been bombed or whatever?"Yes, of course I'm worried about that, and that's why I consult the Foreign Office lawyers when giving this advice on arms exports."But he hinted that government lawyers had not suggested international law had been broken. He told MPs the legal advice he had seen was "consistent with the fact we have not changed" rules on exporting weapons to Israel. Tory MP Bob Seely put it to Lord Cameron that he had seen legal advice suggesting the Israeli government is "vulnerable to a challenge from the Hague court and from elsewhere that in some of the things they are doing in, potentially, in relation to proportionality, there is a vulnerability.""It's close to that," Lord Cameron replied. Downing Street later said Israel needs to "act carefully" and avoid risking further escalation in its war with Hamas.Asked if Rishi Sunak shares Lord Cameron's concerns about whether Israel has been acting within international law, the prime minister's official spokesman said: "It is an issue we continue to keep under review and obviously we have made our views clear to the Israeli government at a number of levels on this."The spokesman added: "Fundamentally, though, we recognise that it is Israel that is responding to a terror attack, first and foremost."Two British nationals are still being held hostage by Hamas as heavy bombardment and fighting continues to shake the region, Lord Cameron told the committee.Asked if he knew if the hostages are alive, Lord Cameron said: "I just don't want to say any more. We don't have any information to share with you."During a ceasefire in November, 105 hostages were released by Hamas.Lord Cameron's comments come as US secretary of state Antony Blinken held talks in Israel seeking to set a plan for Gaza's post-war future.Mr Blinken has called for winding down of the Israeli military campaign in Gaza to reduce regional tensions.US officials have called for the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, to take over in Gaza and for negotiations to resume on the creation of a Palestinian state.

She added that he had called her at 07:00 on the morning of the attack.Elkana Bohbot, 34, had gone to the party with friends and, before losing contact, he spoke to his wife and mother telling them he was helping to evacuate the wounded, the Times of Israel reported. Hours later, his family found a video of him posted online by Hamas, which has been seen by BBC Verify. Rom Braslavski, 19, was working on security for the festival. According to an account published by Hostages and Missing Families Forum, he was trying to rescue an injured person in the attack when he was caught in a volley of fire. He has not been heard from since.Omer Wenkert, 22, a restaurant manager, sent a message to his family to say he was going to a safe shelter but then lost contact, his father Shai Wenkert told the BBC's Today Programme. Shai Wenkert said he had seen footage of his son in captivity, including a photo of him handcuffed and wearing only underwear. Evyatar David, 23, was at the festival and on the morning of the attacks, described fleeing from gunfire before losing contact with the outside world, his brother says. Later, his family say, Evyatar's sister posted on Instagram appealing for information about his whereabouts. She then received a text from an unknown number, which contained video footage of Evyatar handcuffed on the floor of a dark room. According to Israel's foreign ministry he is being held captive by Hamas in Gaza.Eitan Mor, 23, lives in Jerusalem, and was working as a security guard at the festival, the Times of Israel said. He reportedly texted his uncle after Hamas arrived and was last seen with a friend bringing others to safety.Alon Ohel, 22, a Serbian citizen, took refuge in a shelter after the festival came under attack, his family say. They have seen footage of him being dragged away after a grenade attack.Almog Meir Jan, 21, tried to flee the festival. He and a friend made it to the friend's car but only managed to drive a short distance before being forced to stop. Almog's family say they have seen a hostage video in which he appears. Inbar Heiman, a student aged 21, was seen by two young Israeli men being taken away from the festival on a motorcycle. Hamas have released a video in which she is seen very briefly. Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, a dual US-Israeli citizen, was badly injured in the attack, his family told the BBC. Eyewitness accounts say  he was seen being forced onto a white pick-up truck - the last-known signal from his phone came from just inside Gaza.Segev Kalfon, 26, was running away from the festival, across the highway, when he was captured by Hamas, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.Orión Hernández Radoux, 30, from Mexico, attended the festival with his girlfriend, Shani Louk. He has not been seen since. The Sun newspaper says it has seen threatening messages written in Arabic sent from his phone. Shani, a German citizen, was initially thought to be among those seized. But on 30 October, her mother Ricarda told German media that the family had been informed by Israeli military of her death following DNA identification.Romi Lesham Gonen, 23, was on the phone to her mother as she tried to escape from the Supernova festival. Merav Leshem Gonan has recounted a conversation in which her daughter begged for help after being shot. ABC News reports that Romi's phone is now in Gaza. Bar Kuperstein, 21, last spoke to his family early on the morning of 7 October, as the attack unfolded. Later the same day, his family say they identified him in a video of Israeli prisoners, posted by Hamas. Since then, they say they have had no further information.Eliya Cohen, 26, was hiding with his girlfriend Ziv from the attack, when Ziv felt him being pulled up and driven away by the gunmen, Eliya's mother has told the video initiative #BringThemHomeNow. The family then found a photo of Eliya in Gaza, the Times of Israel reported.  Amit Buskila, 28, from Ashdod, was last heard of making a call to her uncle, Shimon, as Hamas overran the festival. Her family say they have now been told by the government that she is being held in Gaza.Carmel Gat, 39, is Jordan's sister-in-law, and also was seen by her father being taken by gunmen from Kibbutz Be'eri, Haaretz newspaper reported. She has not been heard from since. Ohad Yahalomi, 49, was abducted from Nir Oz, along with his 12-year-old son, Eitan, who was released during the November ceasefire. Dror Or, 48, was seen by a neighbour being dragged out of his home in Be'eri, according to their nephew Emmanuel Besorai, along with his son and daughter. On Saturday 25 November Dror's son Noam, 17, and daughter Alma, 13, were released from captivity. The body of Yonat, 50 - Dror's wife and the children's mother - was identified among the 120 people murdered at the kibbutz, Yonat's brother told the Guardian newspaper.Tal Shoham, 38, was taken from Kibbutz Be'eri. His wife Adi, also 38, her mother Dr Shoshan Haran, 67, were released by Hamas on 25 November, along with the couple's children Nave, eight, and Yahel, three. Dr Haran's husband, Avshalom - an economist and dual German/Israeli citizen - was killed on 7 October.Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, an American-Israeli citizen, has been missing since Hamas's attack on Nir Oz, his father Jonathan told the BBC. He said his son was not found among the dead and the "only reasonable explanation" is that he was taken to Gaza.Thailand's ambassador to Israel says 26 of its citizens were taken hostage, 23 of whom have now been released. Those still being held are believed to include Watchara Sriuan, 32. His mother, Viewwaew, told the Thaiger news site that the family had been informed he was being held captive. Kiattisak "Top" Patee and a Mr Pongtorn (no first name given) have also been named by the Thai foreign ministry as hostages. A number of other people thought to have been held hostage are now confirmed to have died, either during the 7 October attack or while in captivity. On 16 December, the Israeli military expressed "deep remorse" after soldiers mistakenly killed three hostages in northern Gaza who had escaped from their captors. They were named as Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26.The death of Tamir Adar, 38, was announced on 5 January by the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum. Other hostages recently confirmed to have died include Gadi Haggai, Ron Scherman, Nik Beizer, Tal Chaimi, an Israeli-Romanian citizen aged 41, Joshua Mollel, a 19-year-old Tanzanian student, 27-year-old Eden Zecharya, and 36-year-old Ziv Dado.Other fatalities include Sahar Baruch, 25, Dror Kaplun, 68, Aviv Atzili, 49, Arye Zalmanovich, 85, Ronen Engel, 54, Maya Goren, 56, Guy Iluz, 26, Ofir Tzarfati, 27, Ofra Keider, 70, and Eliyahu Margalit, 75. The bodies of 19-year-old soldier, Noa Marciano, and 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss were found by Israeli troops in buildings close to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.Hostages whose death has been reported, but not confirmed, include Shiri Bibas, 32, and her two young children, Ariel and Kfir.

Asghar Gheshlaghian, from Woodford Green in east London, operated an unlicensed firm from a business centre, using a sham rug company as a front, Southwark Crown Court heard.Mr Gheshlaghian, 48, was covertly recorded by the National Crime Agency.In one conversation he said "70 to 80 percent" of his business was illegal.The court heard he had also described throwing his phones away in water or in dustbins. For the prosecution, Michael Bisgrove told the court Mr Gheshlaghian used the Islamic "hawala" banking practice to take money from those seeking access to the UK and paying it on to the smugglers once they arrived. Hawala banking is legal in the UK if carried out with a licence. It transfers value without the use of a negotiable instrument for the exchange of money. For example, a US resident who wanted to send money to a person in Pakistan would give a sum to a US-based hawaladar, who would then contact his counterpart in Pakistan.The ultimate recipient in Pakistan would go to the Pakistani hawaladar and receive his money.The two hawaladars would then settle their debt with each other.Source: UK Parliament publicationsMr Bisgrove said the asylum seekers arrived between November 2016 and February 2019, hidden in lorries or brought in on small boats.Mr Gheshlaghian denies five charges including running an unlicensed money transfer service, helping an asylum seeker to enter the UK, and assisting unlawful immigration.  The trial, which is expected to last three weeks, continues.Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

09/01/2024 14:53:00	Global economy set for weakest growth since pandemic, warns World Bank - BBC News	The global economy is set to grow at its slowest pace since the pandemic, the World Bank has warned. It has forecast growth of just 2.4% in 2024 and stated higher interest rates were a major factor. Global trade and investment would continue to be stifled by conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, it said.Outside of the pandemic, growth of 2.4% would be the weakest since the 2009-09 financial crisis.It said the resilience of the US economy meant last year's growth was likely to come at 2.6%.Indermit Gill, chief economist, at the World Bank Group said: "Near-term growth will remain weak, leaving many developing countries - especially the poorest - stuck in a trap".Problems he explained include "paralyzing levels of debt and tenuous access to food for nearly one out of every three people." Global growth is at historically "mediocre" levels and growth in global trade remains sluggish, he added. The twice yearly lookahead warned that fallout from the Israel Hamas conflict "has sharply heightened geopolitical risks". It said the disruption to key shipping routes caused by attacks on vessels in the Red Sea increased the likelihood of "inflationary bottlenecks". Political concern about rising prices was voiced by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on his ongoing tour to the region on Monday. He tweeted that the attacks "have disrupted or diverted nearly 20% of global shipping. This increases the cost and time of moving food, fuel, medicine, and humanitarian assistance."It comes at a time when central banks around the world are beginning to feel that they are getting on top of the cost living crisis. Nearly two years of steady increases in the cost of borrowing have brought inflation closer of the 2% target in the US, UK and Eurozone and rates cuts are widely expected this year.However those higher interest rates in the world's biggest economies also make borrowing more expensive in poorer countries and the World Bank is particularly concerned about how affordable that is for the world's 75 poorest countries.This is one way in which the report highlights that richer countries are recovering better from the pandemic than poorer nations."At the end of 2024 we project that all advanced economies will have a per capita income that is higher than what they had before COVID" said Mr Gill. However he added the average income of an individual in an emerging economy will be 75% of the pre-covid level, while it could be as low as 66% in the poorest countriesThere is particular concern about the cost of food for the world's poorest people, especially given last year's 27% increase in the price of rice, which has been linked to India severely restricting exports. However ample supplies of other crops such as grains mean average food prices are set to fall 1% this year. There is another reminder that China, the world's second biggest economy, continues to be blighted by a reluctance for consumers to spend money in the shops which has led to prices falling. Combined with the vast debts in its troubled property sector the economy is forecast to grow just 4.5%. That would be the lowest in decades and even below the modest 5% target the government set for 2023. As well as foreign companies investing less some of this slowdown is because of longer-term trends such as an aging population and the difficulties in maintaining the pace of development seen over the last 20 years. "That slowing growth in China presents a headwind to other developed economies, especially those for which China is a major trade partner," said Mr Gill.Overall the World Bank is forecasting that the five years to the end of 2024 will add up to the slowest half decade of global economic growth in 30 years. However there is optimism that the trend can be improved if governments do more to encourage the investments, particularly from the private sector, that will be needed to tackle challenges including climate change and the energy transition. 	
09/01/2024 14:11:00	Saudi Arabia interested in Israel normalisation deal after war - BBC News	Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the UK says it is interested in normalising relations with Israel after the war in Gaza, but that any deal must lead to the creation of a Palestinian state.Prince Khalid bin Bandar told the BBC a pact was "close" when the the kingdom paused US-brokered talks after Hamas's deadly attacks on Israel on 7 October.Saudi Arabia still believed in establishing ties with Israel despite the "deplorable" casualty figures in Gaza, he said, but it would not "come at the cost of the Palestinian people".The ambassador also warned that there was a "failure of humanity" over Gaza, with the international community not doing enough to end the fighting.He also said he would like to see the UK "moderate its position" and "treat Israel the same way it treats everyone else". "The blind spot towards Israel is a real problem because it provides a blind spot to peace," he added.Saudi Arabia is a leader of the Arab and Islamic world. It has never formally recognised Israel since its creation in 1948, and a deal normalising ties would represent a major breakthrough for the Jewish state.In late September, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler had declared in a US television interview that "every day we get closer" to an agreement.While Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the Palestinian issue was "very important" and that any agreement would have to "ease the life of the Palestinians", he did not declare that it would be dependent on advances towards the creation of an independent Palestinian state. The public position of Palestinian leaders is that they will reject outright a deal if it does not leave them with a state, but earlier that month officials had said they were privately demanding a cash boost and more control of land in the occupied West Bank in return for engaging with the US-backed Saudi-Israel process. Saudi officials reportedly asked the US to pause the three-way discussions a few days after the 7 October attacks, in which about 1,300 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage by hundreds of Hamas gunmen who infiltrated southern Israeli communities from Gaza. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 23,200 people have been killed in the territory during the military campaign that Israel subsequently launched with the aim of destroying Hamas.After meeting Crown Prince Mohammed on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters he had brought up the subject of normalisation."There's a clear interest here in pursuing that," he said. "But it will require that the conflict end in Gaza, and it will also clearly require that there be a practical pathway to a Palestinian state."In an interview with the BBC's Today programme on Tuesday, the Saudi ambassador in London confirmed that "absolutely there is interest" among his country's leaders for an agreement."[A deal] was close, there is no question. For us, the final end point definitely included nothing less than an independent state of Palestine. So, while we still - going forward after 7 October - believe in normalisation, it does not come at the cost of the Palestinian people," Prince Khalid said.He added: "We were close to normalisation, therefore close to a Palestinian state. One doesn't come without the other. The sequencing, how it is managed, that is what was being discussed."Asked if Saudi Arabia saw Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other Western countries - as part of that future Palestinian state, Prince Khalid said it "requires a lot of thought"."There is always room for change if you have optimism and hope. But when there is a conflict the first thing you have to recognise is that both sides have lost," he added."The problem that we have today with the current government in Israel is there is an extreme, absolutist perspective which does not work to achieve compromise and therefore you are never going to end the conflict."He did not elaborate, but two far-right Israeli ministers were denounced by the US after they recently called for Palestinians to be resettled outside Gaza.Prince Khalid also warned that there was a risk of radicalisation as a result of the war, which has not only left many thousands of civilians dead in Gaza but also caused widespread devastation and a deep humanitarian crisis."The unprecedented level of the violence that has been carried out by both sides - but in particular by what is meant to be a responsible state in Israel - over the past three months, I don't think I have seen anything like it in my life," he said. "The numbers are deplorable, absolutely deplorable.""That is going to create a lack of hope amongst not just the Palestinian people, but disaffected people [across the world]. All see a failure of humanity in what is happening, because nobody has done anything to stop it. Efforts are being made, but it is not enough."	
09/01/2024 10:39:00	'I cannot sleep in peace' - Israelis fearful as Hezbollah tensions soar - BBC News	Efrat Eldan Schechter is a native of the Northern Galilee and never even considered moving anywhere else to bring up her family - that is until the events of 7 October.  When she heard and watched reports of what was happening in southern Israel that morning, as heavily armed Hamas gunmen streamed out of Gaza, she was immediately taken back to stories from the "Yom Kippur" or 1973 Middle East war, when Israel was attacked simultaneously on two fronts. "I was terrified. Everyone was sleeping in and I thought it's going to be '73 all over again and Hezbollah is coming for us too," says Efrat, as our interview in her front garden is punctuated by the regular loud thud of outgoing Israeli artillery fire."Immediately, I woke everyone up and very quickly got everything together and drove to a relative's house in the centre of Israel."After a month the family returned to their house near Kiryat Shmona, frustrated because they're still living on the edge of a war zone - a "buffer zone" as Efrat calls it - well within range of Hezbollah rockets being fired from southern Lebanon. "What we fear most is that nothing will be done because Hezbollah are just waiting there on the border to come in and invade Israel," says the mother-of-three. "I cannot sleep in peace. I want my government to make sure that we have real security here. If it is necessary, they should act and destroy Hezbollah infrastructure in Lebanon."Ever since violence here erupted on 8 October, when Hezbollah fired rockets and artillery "in solidarity" with the Palestinians, and Israel fired back, clashes in the north are generally confined to a three- or four-mile-wide (5-6km) strip along the entire border. But they are intense and deadly - nine soldiers and four civilians have been killed in Israel, officials say, while authorities in Lebanon have reported that 123 people have been killed, including at least 21 civilians. The frontier communities of northern Israel are today like ghost towns. More than 80,000 residents have been evacuated to centres further south, but Nissan Zeevi is one of the few who has stayed. The businessman, and civil defence member, shows me around his kibbutz - Kfar Giladi, just north of Kiryat Shmona. The scenery is beguiling as you look out over the lush, green Hula valley and Mount Hermon in the distance, but this border has always been volatile.Like Efrat, Nissan does not believe most people can return to their homes and businesses until there is a guarantee of a lasting peace. He is particularly frustrated that UN Security Council resolution 1701, which helped end the 2006 Lebanon war between Israel and Hezbollah has not been fully implemented. Crucially, says Nissan, 1701 calls for the demilitarisation of armed groups (specifically Hezbollah) in southern Lebanon. And that, clearly, has not been achieved.Nissan is part of Lobby 1701, which has called for the implementation of the resolution "whether through diplomatic means or through a military action by Israel"."What we are demanding from our government is to take care of Hezbollah, to demolish the threat coming from those areas of southern Lebanon," he tells me, as he points out the many Lebanese villages he can see from his own home and from where, he says, much of the incoming fire emanates.When I ask him if he would support even more action by the Israeli government in southern Lebanon, Nissan says: "Absolutely! It's not only me. A big proportion of the population of Israel is demanding the same." "If we don't do this, we will end up with another 7 October," he adds.Last month, I travelled to those very same frontier villages in southern Lebanon. They're being hit daily by strikes because Israel says Hezbollah is hiding in communities to launch rockets and sophisticated weapons. Just as on the Israeli side, tens of thousands of people have left these areas too, and many have been killed. There's loss on both sides of the border.The possibility that this "contained" border conflict will escalate into a full-scale war came even closer on Monday with the apparent assassination of a senior Hezbollah commander, Wissam Tawil, when his car was hit in an air strike in Khirbet Selim. Last week, it is widely believed that Israel was also responsible for a drone strike in a Hezbollah stronghold in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, that killed Hamas's deputy leader, Saleh al-Arouri.None of this is good news for those trying to make a living near the front line. Farmer Ofer "Poshko" Moskovitz of Kibbutz Misgav Am can't bring in the kibbutz's valuable avocado crop because the Israeli army says it's too dangerous for him to spend time in his orchards, which are right up against the Lebanese border, north-west of Kiryat Shmona. But, unlike many I spoke to in the north, this phlegmatic and jovial farmer does think a wider war can be averted."I'm not worried, because Israel is a strong country," says Ofer as we wade our way through hundreds upon hundreds of almost ripe, green avocados strewn across the ground. He continues: "Nobody is looking for war here. We prefer to do it in a diplomatic way and they are looking for a solution - both the army and diplomatic efforts together."Ofer's cautious positivity is in short supply in these parts.   Sarit Zahavi, who also lives close to the border, is the founder of the Alma Research Institute in northern Israel and spends much of her time analysing political developments among Israel's regional neighbours."We are facing a very dangerous situation, in the sense that if there is to be a diplomatic arrangement, it would mean a ceasefire. And everybody will think that is good news," she tells me."But, for me, if there will be a ceasefire, nobody will enforce the arrangement. Then Hezbollah will continue to grow, and will continue to develop its capabilities to invade Israel."Fewer people, at least in northern Israel, seem to be confident that diplomacy can now avert a wider war. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has already vowed to retaliate for Israel's actions and, Israel too, seems to be preparing for the possibility of an escalation. On Monday, Israel carried out some of the heaviest bombing so far along its northern border just as the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv. With the devastating war in Gaza and the latest developments in the north, the challenge for Secretary Blinken seems almost impossible.

09/01/2024 00:00:00	High number of civilians hurt by explosives in 2023 - BBC News	Last year saw the highest number of civilian casualties killed or injured by explosives in more than a decade, according to new research.The UK-based charity Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) recorded a 122% percent increase in civilian fatalities caused by explosives in 2023. The rise is largely due to the war being fought between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.Conflicts in Ukraine, Sudan, Myanmar and Somalia also contributed.AOAV is a London based charity which records and monitors evidence of armed violence against civilians worldwide. Its reporting and analysis is used by international forums such as the UN. It has also presented its evidence to the UK's Parliament.In 2023, AOAV identified at least 7,307 explosive incidents around the globe, up from 4,322 recorded the previous year.The attacks caused the deaths of at least 15,305 civilians, accounting for a rise of 122% from 2022. Tens of thousands more were injured. AOAV describes Israel's war in Gaza as "a major cause for such a dramatic increase" in civilian casualties, accounting for around one third of the global total. It recorded 920 incidents of explosive weapons use in Gaza, resulting in 9,334 people being killed. That is lower than other estimates. AOAV says its data does not capture all harm, but does highlight clear trends in explosive violence. It says the data includes reports from reputable media organisations.Israel's military operation, which began on 7 October in response to the Hamas attacks, also contributed to a huge increase in the number of air strikes recorded, the charity said.AOAV says the use of air-launched weapons across the globe increased by 226% in 2023 - rising from 519 incidents in 2022 to 1,694 last year. Israel has repeatedly stated it has taken unprecedented steps to avoid civilian casualties, including issuing warnings in advance of air strikes. But AOAV's research shows that when explosive weapons are used in populated areas, the vast majority of those injured are likely to be civilians. AOAV's director, Iain Overton, says its data should be a stark warning to states that using explosive weapons in urban areas disproportionately impacts civilians.  The charity also recorded a significant increase in the use of ground-launched weapons in 2023. Across the globe state actors were responsible for 77% of the civilian casualties caused by explosives. AOAV says Israel "was by far the most injurious state actor in 2023", with more than 1,000 attacks leading to 12,950 civilian casualties - dead and injured. Russia was second, with its war in Ukraine causing 8,351 civilian casualties. Ongoing conflicts in Sudan, Myanmar, Syria and Somalia also contributed to the highest civilian casualties recorded by AOAV since 2010. Non-state actors, including militants and proscribed groups, were also behind the increase in the use of explosive weapons last year. However, AOAV recorded the number of civilians killed by non-state actors as falling by 8%. 	
08/01/2024 21:17:00	Antony Blinken: On the US mission to stop Gaza igniting wider war - BBC News	Of all the priorities for US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on his fourth visit to the Middle East in three months, there is one message above all others that he wants to deliver. His main mission on this trip is to ensure the Israel-Gaza war does not spread into a regional conflict.As he flies between destinations in southwest Asia - a packed schedule that includes stops in Turkey, Jordan, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Israel - there is ample evidence, however, that the cauldron of tensions in the region is on the verge of boiling over.Houthi rebels in Yemen have launched repeated missile and drone attacks on civilian shipping in the Red Sea, bringing traffic through that key international waterway to a near halt. The US has warned that it will defend its interests. If the rebels persist, and the disruption to global commerce continues, an American military response may be inevitable - a development that would unnerve some key American Arab allies."We never see a military action as a resolution," said the Qatari prime minister in a joint press conference with Mr Blinken in Doha on Sunday. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said his biggest worry was that such action would "keep us in a loop that will never end and will create a real tension in the entire region".On Saturday, Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon fired a barrage of rocket attacks on northern Israel in reprisal for what appeared to be an Israeli-planned bomb attack that killed a key Hamas leader in Beirut. Israel responded with air strikes targeting Hezbollah forces in Lebanon.An escalation there, Mr Blinken said later that day, was a "real concern". He called on regional powers with influence over Hezbollah - in other words Iran and, to a lesser extent, Turkey - to use their influence to "try to keep things in check".That may be difficult. As the Washington Post reported, American officials are concerned that Israel may be considering a more expansive offensive against Hezbollah."We prefer the path of an agreed-upon diplomatic settlement, but we are getting close to the point where the hourglass will turn over," Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Friday.Meanwhile, US military installations have been hit by rocket and drone attacks from militants in Iraq and Syria, where more than 3,000 American soldiers are stationed. In late October, a drone breached US defences and struck a barracks but did not detonate, according to a Reuters report, narrowly avoiding what might have been significant American casualties. The US has responded with military action, including an air strike in Baghdad last week that killed Mushtaq Taleb al-Saidi, an Iran-backed militia leader.Each of these episodes, taken individually, presents a threat to regional stability. When viewed as a whole, it suggests a Middle East teetering on the brink of wider war.In Qatar on Sunday, Mr Blinken said the US has a plan to address the growing instability - and it hinges on winding down the Israeli military campaign in Gaza and working with Arab nations and the Israelis to establish a "durable" peace for the Palestinians."The United States has a vision for how to get there, a regional approach that delivers lasting security for Israel and a state for the Palestinian people," he said. "And my takeaway from the discussions so far ... is that our partners are willing to have these difficult conversations and to make hard decisions."Therein lies the rub. After meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday, Mr Blinken said he's seen a willingness to help stabilise and revitalise a post-war Gaza among all the leaders he's spoken with so far. But the US has to get Israel on board. The timing of Mr Blinken's latest Middle East trip may give hints of the American strategy in this latest round of shuttle diplomacy. His early visits to Turkey and Arab nations before two days in Israel have allowed the secretary to take the temperature of regional players before sitting down with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli War Cabinet.Then the ball, as Americans like to say, is in the Israeli court."I'll have an opportunity to share with Israeli leaders everything I've heard thus far on this trip," he said on Monday. "I'm convinced that there is a future path that can actually bring lasting peace and security for Israel."Behind all this is an American gamble - that resolving, or at least winding down, the Gaza War will cool tensions throughout the region. It is a bet that the various mini-crises - in the Red Sea, in Lebanon, and in Iraq and Syria - have not taken on a momentum of their own.There is no peace in the region without a legitimate, peaceful solution to the Palestinian conflict, the Qatari prime minister said on Sunday. The question is, will there be peace with such a resolution?During his November trip to the Middle East, Mr Blinken told reporters gathered on the tarmac in Ankara, Turkey, that countries across the region do not want war - and are working to prevent the conflict from spreading."Sometimes the absence of something bad happening may not be the most obvious evidence of progress, but it is," the US secretary said. Since then, there has been ample evidence that while a wider war may not be wanted, the prospects for one has increased - despite the stated intentions and efforts of Mr Blinken and the Americans.	
08/01/2024 17:03:00	Suspected Israeli strike in Lebanon kills senior Hezbollah commander - BBC News	The Lebanese group Hezbollah says one of its commanders has been killed in a strike in southern Lebanon believed to have been carried out by Israel.Wissam Tawil was reportedly a member of the group's elite Radwan Force, and one of the most prominent Hezbollah figures to be killed in the current violence.Israel's military did not comment, but it did say it had hit Hezbollah targets in response to cross-border attacks.The clashes have raised fears of a wider regional conflict. Hezbollah is an Iran-backed group that wields considerable military and political power in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other Western powers. Its fighters have exchanged fire with Israeli forces almost every day along the border since the start of the war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in the Gaza Strip on 7 October.Israel's prime minister told soldiers stationed on the border with Lebanon on Monday that he was determined to "do everything necessary to restore security to the north".Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that two people - whom it did not name - were killed in an Israeli air strike that targeted a car in the al-Dabsha area of Khirbet Selim at around 10:15 (08:15 GMT) on Monday.The strike caused the vehicle to veer off the road and catch fire, it added.Pictures from the scene showed the burned-out wreck of a car on a roadside. Lebanese security sources said one of those killed in the strike was Wissam Tawil and that the other was also a Hezbollah fighter.Three sources told Reuters news agency that Tawil was the deputy head of a unit within Hezbollah's Radwan Force, whose well-trained members are considered the group's special forces. AFP news agency meanwhile cited another source as saying that Tawil "had a leading role in managing Hezbollah's operations in the south" of Lebanon.Later, Hezbollah issued a statement announcing Tawil's death and describing him as a "commander". It did not confirm that he was killed in a strike, saying only that he "rose as a martyr on the road to Jerusalem". The statement provided no details about Tawil's role in Hezbollah, but the group published photos showing him shaking hands with its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and sitting next the late Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated in a US strike in Iraq in 2020.The group also announced that its fighters had fired at Israeli forces in the Shtoula area of northern Israel and in the disputed Shebaa Farms/Mount Dov area in the occupied Golan Heights.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it would not comment on foreign media reports about Tawil's death.However, not long after the incident in Khirbet Selim it put out a statement saying that it "struck a number of areas in Lebanese territory" after an anti-tank missile was launched towards the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona. "Additionally, [Israeli Air Force] fighter jets struck a series of Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanon, including military sites in which Hezbollah terrorists operated," it added.On Monday afternoon, the IDF said a jet carried out another series of strikes after an aerial defence array intercepted a "suspicious aerial target" that crossed from Lebanon, triggering sirens in the Kfar Blum area.An Israeli soldier was also lightly injured by an anti-tank missile that was fired towards Mount Dov, it added.Over the weekend, the IDF's chief spokesman said it had targeted significant military assets of Hezbollah and carried out "damaging" strikes on the Radwan Force in an effort to drive them away from the border. It came after a rocket and missile barrage launched from Lebanon damaged an air traffic control base on Mount Meron.The cross-border violence over the past three months has already killed dozens of Hezbollah fighters, as well as several Israeli soldiers and Israeli and Lebanese civilians. But so far, Hezbollah has calibrated its actions to prevent a full-scale war with Israel.Last week, reacting to a suspected Israeli strike that killed Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri and six other people in Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut, Hassan Nasrallah warned Israeli authorities against starting a conflict. "Whoever thinks of war with us... he will regret it," he said.However, crucially, there was no threat from Hezbollah's leader to escalate its actions. Many in Lebanon still remember the destruction caused by the month-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 and, with Lebanon suffering a massive economic crisis, there is no public support for any military confrontation. Miscalculation, however, is always a risk.And, in Israel, some senior figures have touted a potential larger offensive against Hezbollah to reduce the threat posed by the group and allow the return of thousands of residents who have been evacuated because of constant attacks. "We'll create a completely different reality [in the north], or we'll get to another war," IDF chief of staff Lt Gen Herzl Halevi said on Sunday.On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told soldiers at a base in Kiryat Shmona that he wanted to "send a message to Hezbollah"."Hezbollah made a big mistake with us in 2006 and it is also doing so now. It thought that we were like 'spider's cobwebs'. Suddenly, it sees what kind of 'spider'. It sees great force here, the unity of the people, the determination to do everything necessary to restore security to the north," he said."Of course, we prefer that this be done without a wide-ranging campaign, but that will not stop us," he added.The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who has been meeting Arab leaders on his latest regional tour, has been trying to de-escalate tensions.He is also expected to call for Israel to reduce the intensity of its fighting in Gaza amid reports of dozens of Palestinians killed in the latest air strikes.	
08/01/2024 09:54:00	Al Jazeera bureau chief's son Hamza al-Dahdouh among journalists killed in Gaza - BBC News	The eldest son of Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief has been killed in an Israeli strike in southern Gaza. Hamza al-Dahdouh, an Al Jazeera network journalist and cameraman, was driving in a car with other journalists along a road between Khan Younis and Rafah on Sunday when it was hit. Freelance journalist Mustafa Thuraya was also killed. A third journalist, Hazem Rajab, was seriously injured.Four other members of bureau chief Wael al-Dahdouh's family have been killed.His wife Amna, his grandchild Adam, his 15-year-old son Mahmoud and seven-year-old daughter Sham were killed in an Israeli strike in Nuseirat refugee camp in October.  According to Al Jazeera correspondent Hisham Zaqout, Hamza al-Dahdouh and a group of journalists were en route to the Moraj area north-east of Rafah - which was designated a "humanitarian zone" by the Israeli army - but which had reportedly experienced recent bombings.Many displaced Gazans had fled to the area to escape the bombardment in other regions of the territory. Hamza had intended to report on the unfolding situation and the aftermath of the bombings in the area, according to Al Jazeera.In a statement to the BBC, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: "An IDF aircraft identified and struck a terrorist who operated an aircraft that posed a threat to IDF troops."We are aware of the reports that during the strike, two other suspects who were in the same vehicle as the terrorist were also hit."Live footage from Al Jazeera showed the aftermath of the strike on the car they had been travelling in. It also showed his father Wael al-Dahdouh in tears, holding his hand and standing next to his body in a morgue in Khan Younis. He was buried in the southern city of Rafah. "Hamza was not just part of me. He was the whole of me. He was the soul of my soul. These are tears of sadness, of loss. These are tears of humanity," his father said at the funeral. "I call on the world to look closely at what's happening in Gaza."Wael al-Dahdouh was himself wounded and his cameraman Samer Abu Daqqa was killed in a separate strike while filming last month. Mr al-Dahdouh, who has eight children, continued reporting on the war in Gaza.Hamza al-Dahdouh had one million followers on Instagram. His final post before he was killed was about his father. "You are steadfast and patient. Do not despair of God's mercy. Be certain that he will reward you," he said. The Al Jazeera Media Network said in a statement that it "strongly condemns the Israeli occupation forces' targeting of Palestinian journalists' car"."The assassination of Mustafa and Hamza... whilst they were on their way to carry out their duty in the Gaza Strip, reaffirms the need to take immediate necessary legal measures against the occupation forces to ensure that there is no impunity," it added.It also alleged that the strike "confirms without a doubt the Israeli forces' determination continue these brutal attacks against journalists and their families, aiming to discourage them from performing their mission, violating the principles of freedom of the press and undermines the right to life".US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Hamza al-Dahdouh's death was "an unimaginable tragedy".He added that "far too many innocent Palestinian men, women and children" have died in the war.Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told the BBC's World This Weekend that "Israel does not deliberately target journalists". "We're the only country in the Middle East that actually does have a free press. We're the only country in the entire region where the press can write bad things and criticise the leaders of government," he said. "To say Israel deliberately targets the press is ridiculous, we're the only country that actually enshrines the free press."More than 75 journalists have been killed since the war in Gaza started.More than 22,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. 	
08/01/2024 08:14:00	Palestinians must be able to stay in Gaza - Blinken - BBC News	US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Palestinians must not be pressured into leaving Gaza, and must be allowed to return to their homes once conditions allow.Mr Blinken condemned statements by some Israeli ministers, who called for the resettlement of Palestinians elsewhere.The US official was in Qatar on his latest Middle East tour.His comments followed reports that up to 70 people were killed at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Footage from Jabalia showed bodies lying in the rubble of a destroyed building - many of them women and children.A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that it "acted against a military target in the strike" and that it was "not aware of the number of casualties mentioned"."In response to Hamas' barbaric attacks, the IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities," they said, adding that the IDF "follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm".More than 60 Palestinians were reportedly also killed in the past day in the southern city of Khan Younis.Jabalia camp has been struck many times since Israel began its war against Hamas following the unprecedented attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October. Some 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage in the Hamas raids. More than 22,000 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It has reported at least 113 deaths over 24 hours of Israeli bombardment."Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow," Mr Blinken said on Sunday. "They cannot, they must not be pressed to leave Gaza."Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has called for Palestinians to leave Gaza and make way for Israelis who could "make the desert bloom".And National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, another far-right politician, this week issued a call "to encourage the migration of Gaza residents" as a "solution" to the crisis.The official line from the Israeli government is that Gazans will eventually be able to return to their homes, though it has yet to outline how or when this will be possible.Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. Health officials said even medical facilities including hospitals are now unsafe.Three international medical aid groups announced they were pulling out of the Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza after Israel issued evacuation orders.A representative of the United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that they were "hugely concerned by this development"."What it means is that a hospital that was already over-crowded and overloaded and well beyond its capacity is now without absolutely critical reinforcement to support it as it deals with an ever-increasing number of casualties," said Gemma Connell. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that more than 600 patients and health workers were forced to leave the hospital, according to its director."Their locations are not currently known," said Mr Tedros in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Mr Blinken's latest trip to the Middle East comes amid rising tensions in the region, with concerns that the war in Gaza could spread. Saleh al-Arouri, a top Hamas official, was assassinated in a suspected Israeli attack in southern Beirut on Tuesday along with six others - two Hamas military commanders and four other members.Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed movement in Lebanon, described Arouri's assassination as a "flagrant Israeli aggression" that would not go unpunished. Hezbollah then fired rockets into Israel on Saturday as a "preliminary response" to the killing of Arouri. "This is a moment of profound tension in the region. This is a conflict that could easily metastasize, causing even more insecurity and even more suffering," Mr Blinken said. Qatar's PM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al -Thani said that the killing of Arouri had affected "the complicated process".Mr Blinken also said that the death of journalist Hamza al-Dahdouh, the eldest son of Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief who was killed in an Israeli strike in southern Gaza., was "an unimaginable tragedy".He added that "far too many innocent Palestinian men, women and children" have died in the war.Mr Blinken arrived in Qatar following stops in Jordan, Turkey and Greece. He went on to Abu Dhabi late Sunday, and on Monday is due to travel to Saudi Arabia.	
08/01/2024 16:00:00	Israel Gaza: Senior Hezbollah commander killed in apparent Israeli strike on Lebanon - BBC News		
07/01/2024 12:51:00	Hamas command in north Gaza destroyed, Israel says - BBC News	The Israeli army says it has "completed the dismantling" of Hamas's command structure in the northern Gaza Strip.Army spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters that Palestinian militants are now operating in the area only sporadically and "without commanders".He said Israel had killed around 8,000 militants in north Gaza. The BBC cannot independently verify this number.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) are now focused on dismantling Hamas in south and central Gaza, he said.Israel has killed more than 22,000 people since the war began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. On Sunday, the territory's health ministry said it had recorded more than 113 deaths over the past 24 hours.Gaza has been devastated during Israel's war with Hamas, and most of the territory's population of 2.3 million has been displaced. Israel's offensive started after Hamas gunmen launched a surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking about 240 people hostage.More than 100 remain following some releases in a six-day pause in fighting in November.On Saturday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was focused on ensuring the Gaza conflict does not spread and turn into "an endless cycle of violence" after Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets at Israeli territory on Saturday, in what it called a preliminary response to the killing of a top Hamas official in Beirut earlier this week.Mr Blinken was speaking in Greece at the start of a week-long trip to the region. He has since flown to Jordan, meeting King Abdullah on Sunday before heading to Qatar."Washington should put pressure on Israel to agree to an immediate ceasefire in Gaza," King Abdullah told Mr Blinken, warning him of the "catastrophic repercussions" of the continuation of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, a palace statement said.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on Saturday that Israel would continue its campaign to "eliminate Hamas, return our hostages and ensure that Gaza will no longer be a threat to Israel"."We have to put everything aside... until the complete victory is achieved," Mr Netanyahu said in a statement.In other developments, on Sunday the eldest son of Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief Wael al-Dahdouh, Hamza al-Dahdouh, was killed along with another journalist, Mustafa Thuraya, in an Israeli strike in southern Gaza. Six Palestinians were killed in an Israeli raid in the city of Jenin in the occupied-West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said on Sunday. Palestinian media said the raid involved a large deployment of Israeli forces.In addition to the raid, an Israeli air strike reportedly targeted a gathering in the West Bank, after an Israeli military vehicle struck an explosive device, killing one officer. Jenin has been a scene of repeated Israeli operations over the past 18 months and they have intensified since the war in Gaza started on 7 October.On the northern border of Israel, Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets at Israeli territory on Saturday following the killing of Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri in a suspected Israeli attack in the Lebanese capital.A statement by the Iranian-backed Lebanese movement says it hit an air traffic control base in Meron with 62 rockets. The Israeli military said it had identified about 40 launches from Lebanon, and that it had responded. 	
07/01/2024 09:30:00	Israel-Palestinian bitterness deepened by Hamas attack and war - BBC News	Even as war rages on in Gaza, causing huge loss of life, a recent survey suggests there is wide support among Palestinians for Hamas's deadly attacks on Israel which triggered it. Meanwhile, most Israelis are not focused on the killing of Palestinian civilians and back their country's military offensive to crush Hamas and bring home hostages, polls suggest.Three months into the deadliest round of fighting in the decades-old conflict here, I have been asking Israelis and Palestinians in Jerusalem for their views.Serving frothy coffees in the winter sunshine, the cafeterias in the west of the city are bustling. But for Israelis, the war raging in Gaza is a constant worry."It's always on our mind, we have many friends with children and relatives who are [soldiers] there in Gaza, and we pray for them a lot," says Edna, a religious Jewish woman from Bnei Brak."Just yesterday we visited the son of a friend who was very injured. They don't know if he will lose both his legs.  By God's will, he won't," she says."And we keep on thinking about the hostages. It's like a piece of us is in there."The attacks of the 7th of October killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel. More than 100 of the 240 hostages who were snatched and taken to Gaza remain in captivity.Meanwhile, Israel's air and ground assaults in the Palestinian territory have killed about 23,000 people, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says. The vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have been forced to flee their homes amid widespread destruction.Yet, last week, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) found that two-thirds of Israelis did not think Israel should agree to demands from the US to shift to a phase of the war that reduces heavy bombing in densely populated areas. "People who want to see what is happening in Gaza can see it via the internet," says leading IDI pollster, Professor Tamar Hermann, referring to the human suffering. "But the media is not bringing to our living rooms the same images as people see in Europe or other states in the world."She adds that scenes of Gazan civilians celebrating the 7th of October assault undermined public sympathy in Israel."Unlike in previous military operations, the civilians are not perceived here as innocent bystanders. The sympathy is quite low," Prof Hermann says. Heading towards the Old City, I find Tzafir Bracha who has come for a visit. He is staying with relatives and is one of tens of thousands of Israelis, most of them evacuated, from southern Israel who has not returned home for three months. He is still reeling with the shock of what happened."I think it'll take time for everybody to understand how big this event was [on 7th of October] and what a catastrophe it was. I think most of us are still licking our wounds," he tells me. "I think that nobody can understand this unless it happened to them."Tzafir believes the world should see that Hamas must be defeated so it is no longer a threat."We have to have a victory. You have to find the people that caused this and take them [away] from society and only then can you really have peace," he says.In the narrow streets of the Old City, many Palestinians from the occupied East of Jerusalem tell me they feel restricted in what they can say publicly. Many point out how social media posts are often monitored by Israel.  But everyone I meet is following the war minute by minute."I am on Instagram, on X. I follow people from Gaza," says Haneen, a student nurse. "We all feel so sad." But she tells me she doubts Israel's official version of what happened on the 7th of October.  "We know as Palestinians that Israel used propaganda, so we don't believe what they say. We know there is some part that's right, but other parts are not right."Her position is common among Palestinians, according to the latest poll carried out in the occupied West Bank and Gaza by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research."The overwhelming majority of the Palestinians do not believe Hamas has committed any atrocities, the overwhelming majority has not seen any videos that show atrocities. Of course, these videos are out there," says Professor Khalil Shikaki, who oversaw the poll.His research found increased support for Hamas, mostly in the West Bank, although a majority of Palestinians still do not back the armed group, seen by Israel, the UK and many Western countries as a terrorist organisation.Most notably, in the survey, 72% of the Palestinian public believed that Hamas's decision to launch its offensive on 7th October was correct.A Palestinian shop owner who does not want to give his name tries to explain the reasoning. He accuses foreign media of ignoring the broader context of the long years of blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt after Hamas took over in 2007 and the tough living conditions it created."People in Gaza have been living in a big prison," he tells me. Now he despairs of the international community because it is not doing more to stop the fighting."We see difficult things on the TV. Very difficult. Children get killed. Women get killed. Old people get killed with no reason. They didn't do anything. It's unbelievable," the shopkeeper says.  "Honestly, I don't imagine, how could people be watching these kind of things and they have the power to stop these things?  They are watching a Hollywood movie? It's like nothing [to them]?"In Jerusalem, there is a lot that divides the Israelis and Palestinians I have been speaking to.  However, most now share a deeper mutual mistrust and a common fear about what the months ahead have in store.  There is also a strong feeling on both sides that people around the globe do not understand their pain and suffering.	
06/01/2024 12:37:00	Israel-Gaza war: The huge challenges facing Israel's 'day after' plan - BBC News	When Hamas attacked Israel, almost exactly three months ago, Israel was unprepared.It didn't see the attack coming, struggled to contain it at first and then launched a full-scale invasion of the Gaza Strip with only the bare bones of a plan: to destroy Hamas.Beyond that, there was a yawning vacuum. But that's beginning to change.As outlined to reporters on Thursday, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant's plan for "the day after" is little more than a series of bullet points, but they're worth examining.On security, he doesn't really say anything Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hasn't already - Israel will "reserve its operational freedom of action" throughout the Gaza Strip, and make sure that no-one poses a threat to Israel.It's when the plan touches on what it calls "the four corners of the civilian square" that things get a little blurry.Israel's rigid control over the entry of goods into the Gaza Strip - a fact of life for the past two decades - would continue.Israel, Egypt and the United States would work together on ways to secure the porous border between Egypt and Gaza - something that would involve solving the problem of tunnels once and for all.But the plan envisages a major role for foreign players - the US, plus European and Arab governments - in the creation of a "multinational task force" with responsibility for what's euphemistically called "the rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip".In other words, those countries will be expected to put the whole shattered area back together. And pay for it.For countries, the EU and Gulf States in particular, which have seen their previous investments - hospitals, schools and universities - blown to smithereens over the past three months, it is hardly a tempting prospect.Even assuming Israel succeeds in its goal of eliminating Hamas as a threat, who is to say violence won't erupt in the future, triggering yet another round of costly destruction?The tireless US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is on his latest visit to the region - his fourth since 7 October. As he travels from one Arab capital to another, how much enthusiasm is he likely to encounter from leaders appalled at the scenes of suffering inflicted on Gaza?Until now, the Arab view has been that until there's a ceasefire and the war's devastating humanitarian consequences have been properly addressed, it's impossible to talk about "the day after".But writing for the British think tank Chatham House, Dr Sanam Vakil and Dr Neil Quilliam urge Arab governments not to wait."Without serious regional planning and investment in Gaza," they write, "a potential outcome that could materialize is lawlessness and a Palestinian political vacuum alongside the grim reality of famine, disease and death."And what of that "Palestinian political vacuum"?In Mr Gallant's "four corners" plan, the Palestinian component is perhaps the vaguest."The entity controlling the territory," it says, "will build on the capabilities of the existing administrative mechanism (civil committees) in Gaza - local non-hostile actors."According to media reports, all appointments to local committees would have to be approved by Israel.There's no role for Hamas, obviously, but also none - for now at least - for the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the West Bank, and its president Mahmoud Abbas.For Palestinians, the plan has echoes of a fleeting Israeli effort, in the late 1970s, to promote non-political "Village Leagues" to run local affairs in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip (and thus reduce the influence of the Palestine Liberation Organisation)."Israel cannot conceive of an idea where Palestinians have political agency," says Amjad Iraqi, senior editor at the independent Israeli +972 Magazine."They're basically trying to replicate in Gaza the model they have in the West Bank, but with someone that isn't an organised political faction."Employing local committees composed of Gaza notables would also have the effect of politically separating the Gaza Strip from the West Bank.Palestinians have long been wary of what they see as a deliberate Israeli policy of divide and rule, aimed in part at preventing the establishment of a viable Palestinian state.The West Bank and Gaza may have been physically separate since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, but Palestinians regard both territories as integral parts of their national identity and will fiercely resist any attempt to sever that connection."Gaza is not a separate country," says the Palestinian analyst and former PA spokeswoman Nour Odeh. "They have the same aspirations for statehood and freedom from Israeli control and occupation."US officials, who say they are still examining the Gallant plan (and who point out that it's not yet an official Israeli proposal) don't seem very enthusiastic.For weeks, the Biden administration has been insisting that there should be a role for the Palestinian Authority, in the teeth of opposition from Mr Netanyahu, who argues that the PA has disqualified itself through its failure to condemn Hamas's 7 October attacks.Travelling with Mr Blinken, a senior State Department official said the US still wanted to see the PA ruling over the Palestinian territories - meaning the West Bank and Gaza Strip.He also said it would be hard for the US to get Arab partners to agree to work with Israel when some members of Mr Netanyahu's government were openly calling for Palestinians to be resettled outside Gaza.This remains the biggest Palestinian fear, fuelled by fiery rhetoric from some of Mr Netanyahu's political allies and policy documents from obscure parts of the government.In recent days, those fears have been stoked by reports that the government has been conducting secret negotiations with African countries to accept migrants from Gaza.With a large proportion of Gaza's civilian population now crammed into the southern part of the Strip, some of them having moved multiple times since 7 October, the thought that they might be forced to seek sanctuary outside Gaza - with no certainty of being able to return - is profoundly alarming.But it's not just the Palestinians who are sceptical about Mr Gallant's plan. Some of the most vociferous opposition is already coming from hardline members of Mr Netanyahu's own fractious coalition. Some of them believe it was a fundamental mistake for Israel to pull out of the Gaza Strip in 2005. The only way to guarantee security, they argue, is for Israel to reoccupy the whole area and allow Jewish settlers to return.On this, Mr Gallant seems pretty blunt."There will be no Israeli civilian presence in the Gaza Strip."But for the hardliners, rebuilding Gaza and allowing the Palestinians to stay is merely storing up trouble. "We will go back to October the 7th, maybe in two years, five years, 10 years," says Ohad Tal, an MP from the hardline Religious Zionist Party. "Allowing money from the world to flood into Gaza to rebuild the houses basically means they will take all the money and as before, instead of building Gaza into a Singapore, they made it into the biggest terror nest in the world."The widely reported bust up in Thursday night's cabinet meeting, over the separate but related matter of when and how the Israeli military should examine the circumstances surrounding the 7 October attacks, was a powerful demonstration of the sharp divisions within Mr Netanyahu's government. Those divisions are only likely to deepen as Israel - and the world - grapple with what to do with Gaza when this war finally ends.  Stakes are immense as Biden presses Israel to change courseHamas support soars in West Bank - but full uprising can still be avoidedThe status quo is smashed. The future is messy and dangerousBowen: US sets clearer red lines for Israel as ceasefire endsWhen this truce ends, the decisive next phase of war begins	
06/01/2024 01:10:00	Young Britons exposed to online radicalisation following Hamas attack - BBC News	There has been an unprecedented 12-fold increase in hateful social media content being referred to specialist police officers since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, according to the UK's Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit. Once focused on propaganda shared by the Islamic State group (IS) and the fall-out online following UK-based attacks, much of the unit's focus has shifted to assessing whether hateful and extreme social media posts breach anti-terror legislation. The team says it has received more than 2,700 referrals from the public - shared via an online form - since Hamas attacked Israel, and Israel launched waves of air strikes on the Gaza Strip in return.It is a spike in hate that leaves young Britons increasingly exposed to radicalisation by algorithm.The BBC was given exclusive access to the team's work. Officers told me they are being referred mainly antisemitic content being posted and shared by young Britons who have not been on their radar before.They described a real "intensification" in hate, especially from "youngsters" behaving in what they describe as a reckless way online. One said the period from 7 October stands out because of the "sustained volume" of content. The BBC is not naming the officers because of the nature of their work.Their overall boss, Matt Jukes, head of Counter Terror Policing, fears that while his team is tasked with tackling the most extreme content, there is a failure by social media companies to deal with the "overall climate" of hate created by algorithms. Algorithms are recommendation systems that promote new content to a user based on posts they engage with. That means they can drive some people to more extreme ideas related to posts they've shown an interest in, which they might otherwise never have encountered - rather than simply reflecting their existing views. "The people who in the past needed to seek this material out are getting it pushed to them," says Jukes. "[Before] you had to go to a place or sites and forums and now material which certainly might meet a definition of hateful extremism is being driven to them." Members of the public who submit posts to the team have little idea of what happens next. I'm told the team reviews posts and online material to decide whether they could be in breach of terrorism or other UK terror laws. They are looking out for the most extreme posts and ones that are shared repeatedly, rather than posted "in isolation". The focus is on terrorism-related content that could lead to violence offline or risk radicalising other people into terror ideologies on social media. Right now, that includes posts demonstrating "expression of support for Hamas" and glorifying or showing support for acts of terror, one of the officers tells me. They show me several different screen grabs - with handles blurred - from X, TikTok and a messaging channel. They include messages of support for Hamas and requests for funds to travel to join the group, which is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK and other governments. There are also hateful posts directed at Jewish people. "The platforms people are using are X, Instagram and TikTok. A lot of the posts are text-based," one officers says. "Posts are often reckless, reactive and emotional - made by youngsters very comfortable using these social media sites."What stands out, they say, is how many of the profiles have never posted this type of content before. They believe unsuspecting people are becoming "swept up" in sharing "naked antisemitism". The profile of those posting in this way appears to be mixed, skewing younger but otherwise from a range of places and backgrounds. "There's been much more antisemitic material [referred to us] than Islamophobia material. It's quite marked," another officer says. "We've had material in from far-right groups, which has tended to be very pro-Israel." I've spotted and investigated Islamophobic and racist posts on social media since 7 October - including AI-generated clips - from accounts that oppose the pro-Palestinian movement, as well as antisemitic abuse coming from anti-Israel accounts. What I've been seeing online matches up with what several human rights groups and campaigners have said about a recent rise in both Islamophobic and antisemitic hate on social media. In 2017, there was a spike in content online glorifying a series of terror attacks in the UK, including at London Bridge, Manchester Arena, in Westminster, and at a mosque in London's Finsbury Park. But officers say referrals since the latest Israel-Gaza War began have been "far more sustained" than all of that put together, and the conversation has generated lots more "heat". So far, they say they've found 630 cases identified as being possibly in breach of terror or hate crime legislation.I'm told 150 of those cases have been passed on for further police investigation or action. That includes about 10 being passed to investigation teams within the Met's counter terrorism branch, while others have been passed on to local police forces or regional counter terrorism units.The officers say that that TikTok, X and Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, have been cooperative and quick to remove the most extreme content they flag. However, they say its been trickier with more borderline posts, where its unclear whether they're in breach of the social media sites' guidelines."People are saying some pretty horrible things. But a lot of what we're dealing with sits right on the threshold," one officer says. "You've got this space where there might be content and commentary and material that is very unpalatable. At which point does that tip into a criminal space? It's this team who are having to make these judgments."According to TikTok's policies, since 7 October the social media company "has mobilised significant resources to help maintain the safety of our community". TikTok has said several times how it stands firmly against hateful behaviour and hate speech, and continues to "invest in new ways to diversify recommendations and interrupt repetitive patterns".Meta, which owns Instagram, outlines in its "community standards" how it uses a mix of "automated technology and human review to identify and remove content" that violates its guidelines, including content "that attacks people based on their protected characteristics - which includes their religion, ethnicity or national origin". The social media company has also said: "We continue to remove any imagery that is produced by a Dangerous Organization or Individual, unless it is clear that the user is sharing it in a news reporting or condemnation context."X did not reply to the BBC's request for comment. So what about all of the hate that sits in the middle? It's not extreme enough to be illegal, but it still poisons the public discourse and risks pushing some people further towards extremes. "What's felt extraordinary from the last period is this severely polarised online environment," says Matt Jukes. "People are validated by what they see online. Lots of other people in their echo chamber feel the same." That risk is perhaps elevated for younger people who turn to social media more than ever before for updates. There's a benefit to that; they're arguably better connected than ever before, they're exposed to alternative view points and content and a lot of them are more engaged and energised. For some, though - it carries risk of encountering extremist content. Responsibility for dealing with hateful posts - as of now - lies with the social media companies. It also lies, to some extent, with policy makers looking to regulate the sites, and users themselves. New legislation like the Online Safety Act does force the social media companies to take responsibility for illegal content, too. But the biggest question remains over how to deal with algorithms that stand accused of effectively pushing people towards hate, and normalising harmful rhetoric."It seems extraordinary to me that we have this convergence of terrorism risks, experience of hate crimes online and offline and the interest in this conflict from state actors as we go into the year ahead," says Jukes. These polarised and toxic conversations - which don't cross any legal threshold - risk having a serious impact on public discourse. Not just in relation to this war as it rages on, but on the many elections happening across the world this year. 	
05/01/2024 17:24:00	Israeli ex-hostage returns to site of Nova festival massacre and kidnappings - BBC News	Exactly three months ago this weekend, Eynav Levy and her husband Or were in a hurry. It was just after six o'clock in the morning and they were late in arriving at the Nova Music Festival, in the woods near Kibbutz Re'im, because they'd wanted to spend another night with their two-year old son Almog.Within a matter of hours, Eynav had been shot dead by Hamas gunmen and Or was abducted and taken to Gaza.Now Or's brother, Michael, has come back to the Nova site for the first time. He says it's the hardest thing he's ever done apart from explaining to his little nephew Almog that "his mother won't come back and his father is missing" and that they are looking for him.  "I feel we feel are living someone else's life. It's like a horror movie," he tells me. "It doesn't feel like our lives. I haven't slept for more than three hours straight in 91 days. I barely eat, I just do this."For him, life was turned upside down on 7 October."There was the old Michael prior to 7 October, and there's the new Michael. Now. Those are two different people," he adds.He wants Israel's government to prioritise the release of hostages. "We want them back now. That's it. They need to bring them back as soon as possible. That was the request on day one, and that's the request on day 91. And it's not going to change until they are back."It's thought that more than 130 hostages still remain in Gaza, although some are known to have died. More than 100 hostages, mainly women and children, were released by Hamas in November before a temporary halt in fighting broke down. Among them is 18-year-old Itay Regev, who was freed days after his wounded sister Maya was released. Itay spoke briefly, about what he'd gone through, at today's memorial event at the Nova site. "It was important for me to be here and to speak out," said Itay, still visibly traumatised by his ordeal. "I was in captivity for 54 days and every day was like forever. The conditions are very, very hard to survive. The hostages cannot remain for one more second. They all have to return home now!"The world's attention is still very much focused on the ongoing war in Gaza where Hamas-run health authorities say more than 22,000 people have been killed in Israeli bombings, many of them women and children.But Israel doesn't want the world to forget what happened across the south on 7 October. More than 360 people were killed at Nova alone - when armed Hamas fighters crossed over the border, just two kilometres to the west. The young partygoers stood no chance, the desert scrub offered very little cover in which to hide and their exit routes were blocked by heavily armed Hamas gunmen.There's very little left at the Nova Site now but that doesn't mean what happened here has been erased from memory.At a huge exhibition centre in the city of Tel Aviv, Tal Shimoni - a survivor of the Nova Festival atrocity - shows me around an incredible installation, an almost complete reproduction of the Nova site. Thousands of items including the main canopy, tents, sleeping bags, art exhibits and personal possessions have been brought here from the festival venue.There are many powerful, emotive items including several yellow, portable toilets in which revellers tried to hide but which were riddled with bullets by Hamas gunmen. Of the 30 people who tried to hide inside them, only three survived.Nearby, the main bar from the site has been rebuilt, complete with half-empty bottles, ashtrays and a bullet-damaged cash till. There are also six chest-sized drinks refrigerators. The first rescuers on the scene at Nova found many bodies in and around these fridges - more places where young people had desperately tried to hide from the gunfire. It's a moving experience to walk through the site and imagine being at the Nova festival, perhaps in the early hours before dawn when all hell descended. Music plays out from the same speaker system they had at the festival.It's also painful for Tal to show people around - while she survived physically unscathed, she's emotionally damaged and saw many people killed. But, for her, staging this exhibition is the best way to honour their memories."My friends would want us to go out and celebrate their lives …. We will dance again," she says.In Israel, politicians, diplomats and military leaders are beginning to talk about 'the day after' - what will happen when the war in Gaza eventually ends. That is a step too far for the families of the hostages and something they cannot yet contemplate.The only thing left at Nova now are portraits and photographs of hundreds of partygoers who were murdered here, and of the dozens of hostages taken from here to Gaza, mounted on stakes in the desert soil.For Michael Levy, the only thing that matters now is to secure the release of the hostages. "I have one goal, my one mission in life and it is to bring them back."	
05/01/2024 14:59:00	Israeli minister outlines plans for Gaza after war - BBC News	Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has outlined proposals for the future governance of Gaza once the war between Israel and Hamas is over. There would, he said, be limited Palestinian rule in the territory.Hamas would no longer control Gaza and Israel would retain overall security control, he added.Fighting in Gaza continued alongside the plan's publication, with dozens of people killed in the previous 24 hours, the Hamas-run health ministry said.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due back in the region this week. He is expected to hold talks with Palestinian officials in the occupied West Bank and Israeli leaders.His visit comes amid heightened tensions in the region following the assassination of top Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri on Tuesday in Lebanon's capital Beirut. His killing has widely been blamed on Israel. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement.Under Mr Gallant's now "four corner" plan, Israel would retain overall security control of Gaza.A multi-national force would take charge of rebuilding the territory after the widespread destruction caused by Israeli bombing. Neighbouring Egypt would also have an unspecified role to play under the plan. But the document adds that Palestinians would be responsible for running the territory. "Gaza residents are Palestinian, therefore Palestinian bodies will be in charge, with the condition that there will be no hostile actions or threats against the State of Israel," Mr Gallant said.The plan was not discussed in any detail in the cabinet meeting and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly commented on it. The meeting is reported to have broken up amid acrimony with some ministers angrily objecting to names put forward for an investigation into the events surrounding the 7 October attack by Hamas.Talk of the "day after" in Gaza has led to deep disagreement in Israel. Some far right-wing members of Mr Netanyahu's government have said that Palestinian citizens should be encouraged to leave Gaza for exile, with the reestablishment of Jewish settlements in the territory - controversial proposals that have been rejected as "extremist" and "unworkable" by other countries in the region and by some of Israel's allies.While Mr Gallant's proposals may be regarded as more practical than those suggested by some of his cabinet colleagues, they are likely to be rejected by Palestinian leaders who say that Gazans themselves must be allowed to take full control of running the territory once this devastating war is over.Mr Netanyahu has not publicly talked in any detail about how he thinks Gaza should be governed.He has suggested that the war in Gaza may yet last several months, with the avowed goal being to completely crush Hamas.Mr Gallant's plan also outlined how the Israeli military aims to proceed in the next phase of the war in Gaza.He said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would take a more targeted approach in the north of the Gaza Strip, where operations will include raids, demolishing tunnels and air and ground strikes.In the south, the Israeli military would continue to try to track down Hamas leaders and rescue Israeli hostages, he said.On Thursday, the IDF said it had hit areas in Gaza's north and south, including Gaza City and Khan Younis.It said it had conducted strikes on "terrorist infrastructure" and had killed people who it described as militants, who it said had tried to detonate an explosive next to soldiers.It also announced that it had killed a senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad operative, Mamdouh Lolo, in an air strike. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said 125 people had been killed in the past 24 hours across the Strip.A health ministry official said 14 people - including nine children - were killed by Israeli air strikes in al-Mawasi, to the west of Khan Younis.The small town has been designated a "safe space" by Israeli forces for displaced Palestinians. The IDF has not commented on the claims made by Hamas."We were sleeping at midnight when a strike hit the camp on the tents, 4x2 tents where people were sleeping, most of them children," eyewitness Jamal Hamad Salah told Reuters news agency. "We found one body there that flew 40 metres away."A resident in central Gaza meanwhile has told the BBC News Channel that "nowhere is safe"."Children are crying out in the streets, mothers are crying for their children, we cannot find food, we cannot find water, the situation is getting worse and worse every day," the resident said. "People cannot bear another second of this war... if this continues we'll just simply die slowly."The total number of people killed in Gaza since the start of Israel's retaliatory campaign had reached more than 22,400 by Thursday - comprising almost 1% of the enclave's 2.3 million population, the Hamas-run health ministry said.Israel's offensive started after Hamas gunmen launched a surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking about 240 people hostage.	
05/01/2024 11:13:00	Will Smith surprises Guinea student who biked across Africa - BBC News	Hollywood megastar Will Smith has made a surprise call to a Guinean man who cycled across Africa to get to university.Last year, Mamadou Safayou Barry captured the headlines over his 4,000km (2,500 mile) trek.In a video call to Cairo, where Mr Barry is studying, Smith told him he was "deeply moved" by his efforts and gifted him a new bike and a laptop.He learnt about the epic trip from a BBC Instagram post last September."I want the world to hear your story," the lead in numerous blockbusters said.On a short film uploaded to Smith's YouTube channel, the student appeared shocked to be talking to the Men in Black star. "This is Will Smith!" a smiling Mr Barry said. "A lot of your films I love.""I don't know how to thank you Wallahi [I swear]! I don't know how to thank you," he said later when he heard about the gifts.Smith's publicity team had contacted the BBC after the story of Mr Barry's odyssey had been published saying that it had touched the actor. They wanted to see how they could speak to him.Last May, the 25-year-old set off from the West African country of Guinea for Egypt's prestigious Al-Azhar University, hoping he would be accepted.The married father of one could not afford the cost of a flight, so instead got on his bike and took four months to pedal through Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Benin, Niger and Chad.He travelled through regions where jihadist fighters often stage attacks, and which have seen several military coups.He was arrested and detained three times for no good reason - twice in Burkina Faso and once in Togo.However, Mr Barry's luck turned when he reached Chad. A journalist interviewed Mr Barry and posted his story online, prompting some good Samaritans to fund a flight to Egypt for him.Once he got to Cairo he was offered a university place, initially for Islamic studies and then onto engineering, and a full scholarship.Mr Barry told the BBC he was still shocked by Smith's call."When I saw him, I was confused in my head, because I had seen that man before," the student said."Then I remember - it's Will Smith! Wow... I used to watch his films. I didn't know whether to run or to cry. I was sat on a chair in front of Will Smith!"During the conversation, Smith told Mr Barry "when you commit to a journey, the universe conspires to help you" - a reference to a quote by author Paulo Coelho.On the video, someone can be seen wheeling in a bicycle to give to the student, as well has handing him the laptop.Smith has also donated vouchers so that he can buy flights either back to Guinea to visit his family, or so they can visit him.	
05/01/2024 05:10:00	Qatar: Indian ex-naval officers get 'varying' jail terms - BBC News	Eight former Indian naval officers who were earlier sentenced to death in Qatar now face prison sentences of "varying" lengths, India has said.The men have 60 days to appeal the jail terms. Last month, a court in Qatar had commuted their death penalties.Neither Qatar nor India have revealed the specific charges against the men.But Financial Times and Reuters have reported, citing anonymous sources, that the men were charged with spying for Israel.India, Qatar and Israel have not commented on this. The court orders in the matter have also not been made public. India has been issuing statements about the major developments in the case, which was seen as a diplomatic test for the government.In a press briefing on Thursday, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that the legal team of the men now have access to the court order commuting their death sentences, adding that it was a "confidential document". "What we can tell you, confirm to you is, that the death penalty has now been converted into varying prison sentences for the eight Indian nationals," he said, adding that they have 60 days to appeal the judgement in the Court of Cassation, Qatar's highest court. He did not disclose the quantum of the jail terms."It is for the legal team now to decide the next course of action," he said.In October 2023, India had said it was "deeply shocked" after the Court of First Instance in Qatar sentenced the men to death.The foreign ministry said it would explore all legal options and later filed an appeal against the sentence. The arrest of the men had made front-page headlines in India in 2022.The Indian government has described the eight men in a statement as employees of a private company called Al Dahra, but they have been widely reported to be former personnel of the Indian Navy. In parliament, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar described them as "ex-servicemen" of the country. The families of some of the men have also confirmed their identities and background in the Navy to local media.BBC News India is now on YouTube.

04/01/2024 20:39:00	Saleh al-Arouri: Thousands attend Hamas deputy leader's funeral in Beirut - BBC News	Thousands of people have attended the funeral in Beirut of Saleh al-Arouri, the top Hamas leader assassinated in a suspected Israeli attack in the Lebanese capital two days ago. Crowds carried banners with his picture and waved Palestinian and Hamas flags through the streets amid the sound of music, prayers and heavy gunfire, while Hamas officials vowed to retaliate.The assassination of Arouri was a blow for Hamas - he was a deputy Hamas leader and a key figure in the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the group's armed wing - and renewed fears of a wider war in the region. It also hit its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed movement, as it struck Dahiyeh, a suburb of the city that is a stronghold for the group.In Lebanon, again, the focus is on what Hassan Nasrallah, the influential Hezbollah leader, will decide to do.Less than 24 hours after the attack, he addressed his followers, in a speech that had been scheduled to commemorate the Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, killed in a US drone strike four years ago. He could not ignore what had just happened in his own backyard.As usual, Nasrallah spoke from an undisclosed location, and described Arouri's assassination as a "flagrant Israeli aggression" that would not go unpunished. "If the enemy considers waging a war against Lebanon, our battle will be without boundaries or rules," he said.But, crucially, there was no open threat to attack Israel, which has neither confirmed or denied involvement in the killing, nor any indication of how Hezbollah might act. One of Hezbollah's aims is the destruction of Israel, which sees the group as a more formidable enemy than Hamas. Hezbollah has a vast arsenal of weapons including precision-guided missiles that can strike deep into Israeli territory, as well as tens of thousands of well-trained, battle-hardened fighters.Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October, Hezbollah has been attacking positions in northern Israel almost every day, describing the actions as its support for the Palestinian group. The Israeli military has retaliated, but so far, the violence has been largely contained to areas along the Lebanon-Israel border.Hezbollah has calculated its actions to prevent a full-scale war with Israel, and there is no indication this strategy is likely to change. Many here still remember the destruction caused by the month-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, and with Lebanon suffering a massive economic crisis, there is virtually no public support for any military confrontation. Israeli authorities have warned Hezbollah against escalating the conflict. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has in the past said Israel's military could do to Beirut what it had done to Gaza. On Thursday, as he met US envoy Amos Hochstein in Tel Aviv, Mr Gallant reaffirmed his country's determination to change the security situation in northern Israel, to allow the return of residents evacuated due to constant attacks. But, he said, there was a "short window of time for diplomatic understandings, which we prefer". Some senior Israeli officials, however, have supported further action against Hezbollah to eliminate the threat posed by the group.Nasrallah is expected to address his supporters again on Friday. His latest speech may be an indication that for whatever reason, he wants to avoid triggering a bigger conflict with Israel. However, he needs to be seen to be giving a response to the attack in Beirut. But any reaction is likely to be calibrated to avoid strong retaliation from Israel, and the possibility of another catastrophic conflict for Lebanon.	
04/01/2024 19:18:00	IS claims responsibility for deadly Iran bombings that killed 84 - BBC News	The Islamic State group (IS) has said it carried out a bomb attack in Iran on crowds marking the anniversary of spymaster Qasem Soleimani's assassination by the US.The attack in Kerman in southern Iran killed 84 people and wounded many more.The death toll was revised down on Thursday morning by the head of Iran's emergency services from an earlier figure of 95.Iran initially said that Israel and the US must have been behind the attacks.IS made the claim via its channels on Telegram. The group later released an image on its news outlet Amaq showing two masked men, who it said were responsible for the attacks.The report stated that the first suicide bomber detonated his explosives belt among a gathering of people and that the second bomber triggered his explosives about 20 minutes later.IS named the attackers as "Omar al-Muwahhid" and "Sayfullah al-Mujahid". They are generic names that make it hard to ascertain if the attackers were Iranians or foreigners.IS has attacked civilians and security forces in Iran on a number of occasions in recent years.It welcomed the 2020 death of Gen Soleimani, whose militias fought against the group in Iraq for years.Earlier, President Ebrahim Raisi's political deputy, Mohammad Jamshidi, blamed Israel and the US. However, the US said it had no indication that Israel was involved and dismissed any suggestion that Washington was involved.  And as many Middle East watchers said at the time, this was not the way Israel operates inside Iran. Attacks there that have been presumed to be orchestrated by Israel's external spy agency, Mossad, have nearly always been precisely targeted assassinations of prominent nuclear scientists or military figures.It would not be in Israel's interests to squander its precious intelligence assets inside Iran by blowing up civilian mourners.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed a "harsh response" to the attacks."Cruel criminals must know that they will be strongly dealt with from now on and undoubtedly there will be a harsh response," Ayatollah Khamenei said in a statement on Wednesday evening.Now that Islamic State (IS) has claimed they were behind it, even naming two suicide bombers they say were involved, an apology from Iran's Revolutionary Guard is highly unlikely. The Tehran regime's hostility to the US and Israel is visceral and manifests itself on many fronts: in Lebanon, Iraq, Gaza and Yemen. Soleimani was seen as the most powerful figure in Iran after the supreme leader before he was killed in a US drone strike in neighbouring Iraq in 2020.Wednesday's attack comes amid heightened tensions in the region after the deputy leader of the Iran-backed Palestinian group, Hamas, was killed in an apparent Israeli drone strike in Lebanon.Footage broadcast by Iranian state TV showed large crowds were taking part in a procession along a road lined with banners featuring Qasem Soleimani when the explosions happened.People could be heard screaming and then seen running away in panic after one of the blasts.Iranian media reported the first bomb was detonated around 15:00 local time (11:30 GMT), about 700m (2,300ft) from the Garden of Martyrs cemetery around the Saheb al-Zaman mosque, in the eastern outskirts of Kerman. The second bombing took place about 15 minutes later, around 1km away from the cemetery, targeting people who had fled the first, they said.Kerman province's governor told state news agency Irna that both blasts happened outside security checkpoints and that authorities were sure they were caused by bombs. But he said it was not yet clear whether they were detonated remotely or by suicide attackers.The hardline Tasnim news agency, which is affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guards, earlier cited sources as saying that "two bags carrying bombs" were apparently detonated "by remote control"."We were walking towards the cemetery when a car suddenly stopped behind us and a waste bin containing a bomb exploded," a witness was quoted by Isna news agency as saying."We only heard the sound of the explosion and saw people falling."As commander of the Revolutionary Guards' overseas operations arm, the Quds Force, Soleimani was an architect of Iranian policy across the region.He was in charge of the Quds Force's clandestine missions and its provision of guidance, funding, weapons, intelligence and logistical support to allied governments and armed groups, including Hezbollah and Hamas.Then-US President Donald Trump, who ordered the 2020 drone strike, described Soleimani as "the number one terrorist anywhere in the world" and alleged that troops under his command had murdered hundreds of American civilians and servicemen over the previous two decades. Iran's government accused the US of an act of international terrorism and issued arrest warrants for Mr Trump and other officials. Additional reporting by BBC MonitoringAre you in the affected area?

04/01/2024 17:00:00	Israel Gaza war: Hamas accuses Israel of hitting 'safe zone' killing 14 - BBC News		
04/01/2024 02:10:00	Houthis defiant after warning over Red Sea attacks - BBC News	The US, UK and 10 other states have warned rebels in Yemen they will face consequences if they continue to attack commercial shipping in the Red Sea. In a joint statement, the group of mainly Western countries called for an immediate end to the attacks.However the Houthis have responded with defiance, vowing to continue targeting vessels they consider linked to Israel.The situation in the strategically vital southern Red Sea is now at a stand-off.The Bab al-Mandab strait is a critical waterway through which almost 15% of global trade passes. If attacks continue, the fear is that fuel prices will rise and supply chains will be damaged. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have declared support for Hamas in the war it launched against Israel in October. Since November, the rebels have attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea more than 20 times using missiles, drones, fast boats and helicopters. They have claimed - often falsely - the ships were linked to Israel. US and British warships in the region have intercepted some missiles but they have resisted attacking targets in Yemen itself. That may be about to change.In their statement, the group of 12 states - Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, the UK and the US - called the attacks on shipping "illegal, unacceptable, and profoundly destabilising" and said there was "no lawful justification for intentionally targeting civilian shipping and naval vessels".Any armed response is likely to mean armed action against Houthi bases, boats and weapons.US, British and French warships in the Red Sea all have the capability to shoot down Houthi missiles and drones but it is getting expensive and they can't be sure to hit every single one, especially if the Houthis decide to launch a "swarm" attack - launching multiple drones and missiles at once, as Russia has been doing in Ukraine. Yemen may be the poorest Arab nation but the Houthis have a large stockpile of missiles and drones.The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are avoiding the Red Sea and steaming around southern Africa instead. In a debate at the UN Security Council on Wednesday evening, there was unanimous condemnation of the Houthi attacks but there were also warnings against further escalation. The US ambassador to the UN for management and reform, Chris Lu, said the attacks posed "grave implications for maritime security, international shipping and commerce". Iran's role, he added, was "the root of the problem". "Iran has long enabled these attacks by the Houthis," he said.Iran has denied supporting the strikes. Despite this, it is unclear how it may respond if Western air strikes are launched against its Yemeni allies.The group comes from a sub-sect of the country's Shia Muslim minority, the Zaidis. They take their name from the movement's founder, Hussein al Houthi.They have been fighting a civil war since 2014 against Yemen's government and control both the capital Sana'a and the north of the country, as well as the Red Sea coastline. The government has been backed against the Houthis by a coalition of Arab countries led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.	
03/01/2024 20:47:00	Saleh al-Arouri: Hamas leader's death 'won't go unpunished', says Hezbollah chief - BBC News	Hasan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, says the killing of Hamas's powerful deputy leader will "not go unpunished". Saleh al-Arouri died in a drone attack in Beirut on Tuesday. Israel has not confirmed it was responsible. Mr Nasrallah described Arouri's death as a "major, dangerous crime about which we cannot be silent". He added that if Israel wages war on Lebanon "there will be no ceilings, no rules" to Hezbollah's response. "We are not afraid of war," said Mr Nasrallah in a televised address. "Those who think of going to war with us will regret it. War with us will come at a very high cost."He previously said that any killings in Lebanon would be a red line.Hezbollah - like its ally, Hamas - is considered a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and others. It is the largest political and military force in Lebanon and has ministers in the country's government. The attack that killed Arouri was the first in Beirut following months of exchanges of fire between Iranian-backed Hezbollah and Israel, in response to the war in Gaza. These had largely been confined to Lebanon's southern border. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said on Wednesday it was "defending its borders" from a number of missiles launched from Lebanon. That was after its military was reported to have increased the number of its air defence batteries near the border.Arouri was a key figure in the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's armed wing, and a close ally of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader. He had been in Lebanon acting as a connection between his group and Hezbollah.He was known to be on Israel's hit list and the country's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu had previously vowed to eliminate Hamas's leaders - wherever they are.Arouri was on a US blacklist too, with a bounty of $5m ($3.9m) on his head since 2018.Miri Eisin, a retired colonel from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that the Hamas deputy was "living in the heart of the Dahiya, in the heart of the Hezbollah area of Beirut" and that he was the "direct connection between Hamas and Hezbollah".She added that while she felt bad for the Lebanese people about the risk of a full-blown conflict with Israel, it was important to deal with "terror operatives". The US said it remained incredibly concerned about the risk of the conflict in Gaza spreading to the wider region after Arouri's death - a fear shared by the Lebanese foreign minister, who said his government had appealed to Hezbollah not to retaliate."We are very concerned, [the] Lebanese don't want to be dragged, even Hezbollah does not want to be dragged into a regional war," Abdallah Bou Habib told the BBC. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on Wednesday that Washington was not given advance notice of the strike in Beirut that killed Arouri. The United Nations (UN) peacekeeping force in Lebanon says it is also deeply worried about a potential escalation of violence. A spokesperson for the UN's Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) has urged all parties to show restraint, saying that a wider conflict would have devastating consequences for both Israel and Lebanon.Iran has condemned the killing of Arouri, with the country's foreign minister criticising Israel for its "cowardly terrorist operations" in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Hamas has reportedly told Egyptian and Qatari mediators that it is suspending talks over the possible release of more Israeli hostages in response to Arouri's killing. There are also reports in Arab media that a scheduled visit by an Israeli delegation to the Egyptian capital has been postponed.Meanwhile, the fighting in Gaza continues. The UN said five people were killed in an attack on the Palestinian Red Crescent building in the southern city of Khan Younis on Tuesday, as Israel urged people to evacuate. A five-day old baby was among the dead, according to a spokeswoman for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). "This was a space where babies were living. This is a space where children were living," said Gemma Connell."You can see on the floor the blood. The world should be absolutely horrified. The world should be absolutely outraged."Leaflets have been dropped in Khan Younis, warning residents to leave specified areas designated a "combat zone" by the IDF. The message said it was an "urgent warning" to evacuate several blocks in numerous neighbourhoods.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 22,000 people have been killed in the territory since Israel started its retaliatory campaign.At least 1,200 people were killed when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October and about 240 others were taken hostage. Some 105 hostages were later released during a six-day ceasefire at the end of November.	
03/01/2024 17:29:00	Suspects held over alleged Argentina parcel plot - BBC News	Police in Argentina have arrested three men from Lebanon and Syria suspected of planning a "terrorist act" in the South American country.They had booked into a hotel near the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires and were reportedly waiting for the arrival of a large parcel from Yemen. The city is currently hosting the Pan-American Maccabiah Games, which brings together thousands of Jewish athletes.Argentina is home to Latin America's largest Jewish community. Security Minister Patricia Bullrich said the government had received information from the US and Israel about a potential threat to the Maccabiah Games."Three people suspected of belonging to terrorist cells are being investigated," she wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.   Speaking to reporters, she said the three men were arrested on 30 December. "There was particular information which worried us, and that was that they had rented [rooms] in a hotel which is no more than two blocks from the Israeli embassy."She added that while the men had arrived on different flights "they are linked". The minister also said the suspects were waiting for a parcel to be delivered from Yemen. The security ministry described the parcel as "an international shipment" which it said weighed 35kg (77lb). They did not specify what the contents may have been. The Jewish community of Buenos Aires has been the target of two deadly bomb attacks in the past. In 1992, 29 people died when a suicide bomber drove a lorry loaded with explosives into the Israeli embassy.But the most deadly attack happened in 1994, when 85 people were killed in the bombing of the Amia Jewish cultural centre in the capital. Argentina accused Lebanon's Hezbollah of being behind both attacks, which the Islamist group denied.Security experts believe Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, has been active on the border between Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay.  Two months ago, Brazil said it had foiled an attack on its soil following the arrest in São Paulo of two men suspected of being linked to Hezbollah.The group is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK, the US, Argentina, Israel and Gulf Arab countries among others. 	
03/01/2024 12:58:00	Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri's assassination sparks wider war fears - BBC News	The shadows stretching across the Middle East and beyond, since the start of the Israel-Gaza war, are now longer and darker with the killing of senior Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri in Lebanon. Arouri, a deputy political leader of Hamas, was killed in a drone strike in southern Beirut. He was a key figure in the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's armed wing, and a close ally of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader. He had been in Lebanon acting as a connection between his group and Hezbollah.Even before the 7 October war erupted, Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had warned that any targeted attack on Lebanese soil would trigger a "powerful response".  But Hezbollah and its Iranian allies know the shape of their reply now, in the burning heat of hostilities, could change the shape of this war - and Hezbollah's fortunes.   It was no secret it was only a matter of time before Hamas leaders outside Gaza would be targeted.   Israel will "operate against Hamas leaders wherever they are". That was Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's warning in November. Months earlier, he explicitly mentioned Arouri. Hamas's deputy leader was also on the US terrorism list with a bounty of $5m (£4m) on his head since 2018.  Israel doesn't usually confirm or deny assassinations, but this long conflict is a chronicle of targeted killings. It's also a history of retaliation and revenge. Israel will now be braced for reprisals. There are clarion calls from Hamas leaders and their allies, from the streets of the occupied West Bank and beyond. Hezbollah and Hamas will need to do something, and be seen to do it.  Hezbollah's first statement called for patience.   Before this moment, this well-armed military and political force had tried to confine its engagement to a war of words, as well as limited attacks across its southern border with Israel to avoid drawing Lebanon into another costly conflagration. The killing of a Hamas official who was a pivotal link to Hezbollah and Iran, in one of its strongholds in Beirut's southern suburbs, has jolted its calculations. But it must be weighing up short-term spectacular strikes, against its much longer game.   Its support along Lebanon's volatile southern frontier is strong. But, in Beirut and beyond, memories of the devastating 2006 Israel-Lebanon war are still raw in a country now reeling from multiple crises of its own making.  It is also no secret that senior Israeli figures have long been pushing to maximise this opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah's threats to its northern communities. Hostilities on this front have so far been sustained - but contained - as Israeli forces are stretched across Gaza and the West Bank. Israel's staunchest ally, the US, has also repeatedly warned against taking the war to Hezbollah, which could have far-reaching reverberations.   This new crisis provoked by the killing of Arouri and six others, including two Hamas military commanders, has come at a time of mounting tension on other fronts, including the vital Red Sea shipping lanes where Iran-backed Houthis have been attacking vessels they say are linked to Israel. Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant recently spoke of seven theatres from where Israel was under attack, including Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq.  There is now an even louder chorus of calls for restraint, from Western capitals to Lebanese politicians and UN peacekeepers there, amid intensifying worry of an even wider war.  But Israel has been categorical from the start. Its war aim is to "destroy Hamas". That means going after its infrastructure, military and political leaders, and finances. Nearly three months on, it admits there is still a long way to go.  Many Israeli foes, as well as friends, question if Hamas can be destroyed through military might and a campaign causing a staggering number of civilian deaths, and a dire humanitarian catastrophe giving rise to profound pain as well as deep-seated anger.  The masterminds of Hamas's 7 October atrocities in southern Israel, including Yahya Sinwar, are still believed to be hiding somewhere in Gaza despite Israel's turbo-charged manhunt. Arouri's death in Lebanon will be concentrating minds in Turkey and Qatar, where Hamas leaders are also based, believing they are safer there.  It will be weighing heavy, too, on the minds of Israeli families whose loved ones are still being held hostage somewhere in Gaza. One of the first casualties of this assassination has been the halt in the indirect talks in Cairo about another exchange of hostages for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel jails. Prime Minister Netanyahu keeps insisting "only pressure will work". Israel has now turned the screws even tighter. 	
03/01/2024 08:14:00	Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri killed in Beirut blast - BBC News	Israel has insisted the assassination of a Hamas leader in Beirut was not an attack on Lebanon, as its enemies warned of "punishment" for his death.Israel has neither confirmed nor denied that it killed Saleh al-Arouri, but a spokesman called it a "surgical strike against the Hamas leadership".Hamas denounced it as a "terrorist act", while its ally Hezbollah said it was an assault on Lebanese sovereignty.Lebanon's PM accused Israel of trying to "drag" it into a regional war.Lebanese media report that Arouri, a deputy political leader of Hamas, was killed in a drone strike in southern Beirut on Tuesday along with six others - two Hamas military commanders and four other members.He was a key figure in the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's armed wing, and a close ally of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader. He had been in Lebanon acting as a connection between his group and Hezbollah.There have been near daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israeli forces since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, but so far the violence has been limited to the area along the Israel-Lebanon border.Hezbollah - which, like Hamas, is considered a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and others - is the largest political and military force in Lebanon and has ministers in the country's government.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) refused to comment on the assassination of Saleh al-Arouri, but said its troops were "highly prepared for any scenario"."The IDF is in a very high state of readiness in all arenas, in defence and offence," spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari told a briefing."The most important thing to say tonight is that we are focused and remain focused on fighting Hamas," he added.Israeli government adviser Mark Regev also stopped short of confirming Israel had carried out the attack, but he told MSNBC: "Whoever did it, it must be clear that this was not an attack on the Lebanese state. "It was not an attack even on Hezbollah, the terrorist organisation. "Whoever did this did a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership. Whoever did this has a gripe with Hamas. That is very clear."Arouri, 57, is the most senior Hamas figure to be killed since Israel went to war with the group after its 7 October attack.On that day, waves of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel and attacked communities around the border, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 240 to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a military offensive in response, with the declared aim of destroying Hamas. Since then, more than 22,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.Lebanon's state news agency said Arouri had been killed by an Israeli drone attack on a Hamas office in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh.A witness from Reuters news agency saw firefighters and paramedics gathered around a high-rise building where there was a large hole in what appeared to be the third floor.Video footage on social media showed a car in flames and extensive damage to buildings in what is a busy residential area.Dahiyeh is known as a stronghold of Hezbollah.Mr Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas's political bureau, called the attack a "cowardly... terrorist act, a violation of Lebanon's sovereignty, and an expansion of its circle of aggression".Hezbollah said that it considered Arouri's death "to be a serious assault on Lebanon, its people, its security, sovereignty, and resistance, and the highly symbolic and significant political and security messages it contains".It said the attack was "a dangerous development in the course of the war... and we in Hezbollah affirm that this crime will never pass without response and punishment". "Its hand is on the trigger, and its resistors are in the highest levels of readiness and preparedness," it added.Iran, a major supporter of both groups, said Arouri's killing would "undoubtedly ignite another surge in the veins of resistance".An Israeli security cabinet meeting scheduled for Tuesday evening to discuss the post-war plan for Gaza was cancelled.The Lebanese Foreign Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, told BBC Radio 4 his government was talking to Hezbollah to "impress on them that they should not respond themselves" but that: "We don't tell them, we dialogue with them in this regard."Over the next 24 hours it will become clear "whether they respond or not", he said, adding: "We are very concerned, [the] Lebanese don't want to be dragged, even Hezbollah does not want to be dragged into a regional war." And he called on the West to "pressure Israel to stop also all its violence and all of its actions, not only on Lebanon, not only on Beirut, but also in Gaza".Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously vowed to eliminate Hamas's leaders, wherever they are.Arouri was also considered the de facto leader of Hamas's military wing in the West Bank, overseeing attacks there, according to Israeli media reports.He is believed to have been involved in the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers in the occupied West Bank in 2014, reports say, and had served time in Israeli jails for other attacks.The Times of Israel says he was also one of the Hamas officials most closely connected to Iran and Hezbollah.	
03/01/2024 01:58:00	Bob Menendez: US senator accused of accepting gifts from Qatar - BBC News	US Senator Bob Menendez has been accused in a new federal indictment of accepting bribes to use his power and influence to benefit Qatar - the second foreign country he is alleged to have improperly aided.The latest allegations accuse him of a corruption scheme from 2021-23. A lawyer for the New Jersey senator said the justice department claims were "baseless" and "bizarre conjectures".Mr Menendez, a Democrat, pleaded not guilty in October to charges alleging he acted as an illegal agent of Egypt.He has faced growing calls to resign, including from his own party, but has so far refused to step aside. The indictment unveiled on Tuesday alleges that Mr Menendez took gifts - including gold bars, cash and furniture - from a New Jersey property developer in return for using his Senate office to help the developer land a multi-million dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund. When accepting these gifts, the indictment alleges, Mr Menendez knew that in return he would be expected to take actions to "benefit the government of Qatar".The document does not contain any new charges, but includes new details of his and the alleged crimes of his wife - Nadine Menendez. Mrs Menendez, who is also charged in the same alleged bribery and extortion scheme, has also pleaded not guilty.Three New Jersey businessman named in the case have denied charges as well.The latest allegation extends the alleged plot by one year, and it includes his time as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee - a post he quit after the initial charges were filed in September. Mr Menendez, 70, has denied any wrongdoing. The new indictment claims he assisted one of the accused businessman - Fred Daibes - by making public comments in favour of Qatar in order to help him secure an investment.An attorney for Mr Daibes, Tim Donohue, told BBC News his client had no immediate comment.After introducing Mr Daibes to an investor who is a member of the Qatari royal family, prosecutors say Mr Menendez "made multiple public statements supporting the Government of Qatar".He then supplied the statements to Mr Daibes to use as a tool to convince the unnamed Qatari royal to invest in his New Jersey real estate project. "You might want to send to them. I am just about to release," Mr Menendez allegedly texted Mr Daibes in August 2021, referring to a press release that contained favourable comments about Qatar. About a month later, the senator and Mr Daibes attended an event in New York hosted by the Qatari government. Days later, the indictment says, Mr Daibes sent the senator photographs of watches ranging in price from $9,990 to $23,990 (£7,900 to £19,000), asking Menendez: "How about one of these?"In 2022, ahead of the meeting with Mr Daibes and the Qatari investor in London, Mr Menendez allegedly texted both of them: "Greetings, I understand my friend is going to visit with you on the 15th of the month. "I hope that this will result in the favorable and mutually beneficial agreement that you have both engaged in discussing."Among the benefits Mr Menendez received from the Qataris, the indictment alleges, were tickets to a Formula One Grand Prix race in Miami, Florida.It also claims that one day after returning from a trip to Qatar and Egypt and being picked up at the airport by Mr Daibes driver, the senator performed a web search for "how much is one kilo of gold worth".A search of the Menendez house in June 2022 discovered, among other things, two one-kilo gold bars that the government says were provided as part of the bribery plot. Agents also discovered hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash that bore Mr Daibes' fingerprints and DNA.Adam Fee, a lawyer for Mr Menendez said in a statement, "the government's new allegations stink of desperation".He said the prosecutors' claims are all "based on routine, lawful contacts between a Senator and his constituents or foreign officials"."At all times, Senator Menendez acted entirely appropriately with respect to Qatar, Egypt, and the many other countries he routinely interacts with," the lawyer added.	
03/01/2024 00:01:00	Red Sea attacks: 'Our shipping costs have jumped 250%' - BBC News	"Some of our costs have gone up 250%". That is the reality for Thomas O'Brien, boss of family-run Boxer Gifts, which designs games and seasonal presents.Their products are made in China so the Leeds-based firm relies heavily on global shipping. But attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea have prompted long diversions to avoid one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.Mr O'Brien is among business owners who have told the BBC this could lead to delays and price rises. It follows a warning from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) that the disruption could have a knock-on effect on product availability and prices.Chief executive Helen Dickinson said this was "as a result of higher transportation and shipping insurance costs"."Over the coming months, some goods will take longer to be shipped," she added.Guy Platten, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping warned "we won't see much of an impact until later on in January".The attacks are being carried out by the Houthi group which has declared support for Hamas and has said it was targeting ships travelling to Israel. It is not clear if all the ships that have been attacked were actually heading to Israel.Because of this and the threat of future assaults, several of the world's largest shipping firms, including Mediterranean Shipping Company and Maersk, have diverted vessels away to a much longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope and then up the west side of the continent.Mr O'Brien said this had led to shipping companies increasing their container costs. For Boxer Gifts that has amounted to a 250% increase in shipping rates in the past two weeks, he said.The company said it would continue to absorb rising costs as much as possible, but if that prices rose further, the cost would have to be passed on. Delays are a problem too. "We just about got used to shipments arriving on time after Covid, but at the moment with the Red Sea, that's adding another 10 to 14 days to shipments," Mr O'Brien said."You end up with a two or three week delay. We've got Valentine's Day products that are likely to be delayed and miss Valentine's Day."The same effect is going to be felt on Mother's Day meaning a huge chunk of our selling time for these games is missed". The German shipping giant Hapag-Lloyd told the BBC it would continue to avoid the Red Sea route until at least 9 January. It sends an average of 50 ships a month through the Suez Canal. Some 25 ships were diverted in the last half of December and 15-20 more will be impacted by today's decision.MSC and Maersk two of the largest shipping lines in the world have paused journeys through the Red Sea until further notice. While, France's CMA-CGM is increasing its rates between Asia and the Mediterranean.While there has been some disruption to supply chains already, Mr Platten, from the International Chamber of Shipping said it would take a few weeks before the problems are really noticed.He said while insurance and fuels costs have gone up for shipping lines "goods are still getting through" because there is an alternative route available.For Mr O'Brien, the financial hit of the ongoing disruption could be hundreds of thousands of pounds, but he said his main concern is letting customers down."That damage your reputation for a lot longer than the short term pain of some money," he said. Rachael Waring's furniture business has been hit with disruption too.A container filled with her imported products was due to pass through the Red Sea before Christmas. Instead, it has been diverted around the Cape of Africa, along with many other cargo ships. "I've got customers that most of the goods on one of the container was destined for, which is a nightmare because they won't have furniture," she said."It has a knock on effect for cash flow because that furniture has been paid for in advance, whereas I should be delivering and invoicing the customer now I can't for another month". Ms Waring said the cost of paying for a container have trebled, and she expected prices to rise further."That increased shipment cost has to be taken into account for creating customers going forward. And that obviously is going to cause problems for inflation," she added. Peter Sand, chief analyst at the Copenhagen-based shipping analytics platform Xeneta, said: "One extra million dollars of fuel costs is put on top of every voyage that goods around the Cape of Good Hope instead of Suez Canal."But he said the increased charges shouldn't become fixed after the threat of attack on ships has subsided. "Everyone needs to have their costs covered from an escalation, but they can't become embedded," he said.	
02/01/2024 21:30:00	Who was Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri killed in Beirut? - BBC News	Saleh al-Arouri was one of the most senior figures in the Hamas hierarchy - a leading man on both the political and military fronts. The 57-year-old was the deputy head of Hamas's political bureau, and helped establish the group's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.He had remained deeply involved with the group's military affairs.He was killed in an explosion in Beirut's southern suburb of Dahiyeh, an attack widely blamed on Israel.Saleh al-Arouri joined Hamas in 1987, and helped establish the group's military presence in the occupied West Bank.He was one of the closest connected Hamas officials to both Iran and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. He had served time in Israeli prisons. After his release he was a negotiator in a deal that saw more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners being released in return for the freeing of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011.On 27 October this year the Israeli army had demolished his West Bank home in the town of Arura, near Ramallah. Arouri was living in Lebanon at the time of his death.Lebanese media reported that he was killed in an Israeli drone attack on Hamas's office in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, alongside six others who were reported to have also been members of Hamas. This is not just about who was killed but where he was killed. A senior Hamas official killed in a Hezbollah stronghold in Lebanon is bound to make things even more precarious at a very volatile junction in the fighting.Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati described the killing as a new Israeli war crime that aimed to drag Lebanon into a new phase of the conflict.Hezbollah called the attack a "serious assault on Lebanon, its people, its security, [and] sovereignty" and warned that "this crime will never pass without response and punishment".Izzat Al-Rishq, a member of the Hamas Political bureau called it a "cowardly assassination by the Zionist occupation". Israel's military has not commented, telling the BBC it does not respond to reports in foreign media. Israel is widely reported to commit targeted killings on foreign soil, but rarely comments on cross-border strikes. Mark Regev, adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, did not say that Israel was responsible but called the attack a "surgical strike" against Hamas's leadership.The country and the wider region now faces an anxious wait to see how Hezbollah reacts, and whether Israel's war in Gaza spills over into Lebanon.	
02/01/2024 18:02:00	Israel to fight South Africa's Gaza genocide claim in court - BBC News	Israel will fight South Africa's claim that it is committing "genocidal" acts in Gaza at the International Court of Justice, an Israeli spokesman has said."History will judge you, and it will judge you without mercy," Eylon Levy said, addressing South African leaders.South Africa filed the case at the ICJ on Friday, to Israel's outrage.South Africa is a staunch supporter of the Palestinians and has repeatedly condemned Israel since the start of the war with Gaza on 7 October.More than 22,000 Palestinians - the majority of them civilians - have been killed in Israeli strikes since the war began, according to Gaza's health ministry which is run by the Islamist group Hamas.Israel declared war on Hamas after the group led a massive attack on communities inside Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages.Following its application to the ICJ, South Africa's presidency said that the country was obliged "to prevent genocide from occurring".The 84-page document states that the "acts and omissions by Israel" are "genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group".South African government lawyers are preparing for the case to be heard on 11 and 12 January, Clayson Monyela, a spokesperson for South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation, said on X.The ICJ, which is based in the Hague in the Netherlands, is the UN's highest court. It settles disputes between states and gives advisory opinions on international legal issues. It does not have the power to bring prosecutions. However, its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international legal bodies.Israel intended to fight the case, Eylon Levy said, "to dispel South Africa's absurd blood libel".A blood libel is a term used to describe antisemitic false allegations against Jewish communities of bloodletting, originating in Europe in the Middle Ages. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu angrily rejected South Africa's allegations when it filed the lawsuit, saying "No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas."It would murder all of us if it could. In contrast, the IDF [Israeli army] is acting as morally as possible."It comes as Israel is already facing an investigation by the ICJ, initiated by the Palestinians, into its "prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of... Palestinian territory".The court has sat in judgement on Israel once before, in 2004, when it found that Israel's barrier built in and around the occupied West Bank was against international law. Israel said the barrier was built to thwart suicide bombings from the West Bank; Palestinians considered it a mechanism to take land.	
02/01/2024 17:47:00	Turkey detains 34 on suspicion of spying for Israel - BBC News	Turkey says it has seized 34 people who are alleged to have been involved in spying and planning abductions for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency.Officials said 57 addresses were raided in Istanbul and elsewhere and they were still searching for 12 more suspects.There was no immediate comment from Israel, but relations between the two countries have declined dramatically during Israel's war with Hamas.Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya shared video of Operation Mole taking place.He said authorities had moved in after they had decided that Israeli intelligence was seeking to carry out "tactical tasks such as reconnaissance, pursuit, assault, and kidnapping against foreign nationals residing in our country".Although he made no reference to Hamas, Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, issued a warning last month to Israel that it would be "doomed to pay a heavy price" if it tried to assassinate members of Hamas on Turkish soil.Unlike the UK, US and EU, Turkey does not categorise Hamas as a terrorist organisation and for years has maintained ties with its leadership, hosting some of its members on Turkish soil. President Erdogan has even described Hamas militants as "liberators who protect their land".In November, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant made clear that they would target Hamas chiefs wherever they were.An undated recording was broadcast in Israel days later in which the head of Shin Bet domestic security, Ronen Bar, was heard saying the cabinet had set the agency the goal of eliminating Hamas."We will do this everywhere, in Gaza, in the West Bank, in Lebanon, in Turkey, in Qatar. It will take a few years but we will be there to do it," he was quoted as saying.The death of Hamas's deputy political leader in Lebanon, Saleh al-Arouri, in an explosion in Beirut on Tuesday was immediately blamed on Israel by Lebanon's Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah.Video of some of the Turkish raids posted by the interior minister showed police bursting into people's flats, handcuffing suspects and putting them into police cars.However, this is not the first time Turkish officials have highlighted operations targeting purported Mossad agents.In 2022, dozens of people were arrested on suspicion of spying on Palestinian citizens. Then last July, Turkey's MIT intelligence agency named seven suspects it said had confessed to working for Mossad. Turkish popular and political opinion is broadly behind the Palestinians and a big anti-Israel rally took place in the heart of Istanbul on Monday.	
02/01/2024 15:50:00	What is behind Turkey's staunch support for Hamas in Gaza? - BBC News	On the first day of the year, tens of thousands of Turks poured on to the streets of Istanbul, chanting "Murderer Israel, get out of Palestine".It was not the first massive pro-Palestinian rally in Turkey since the start of Israel-Gaza war on 7 October.But Monday's mass protest followed incendiary remarks by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Since he first came to power more than 20 years ago, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Palestinians, including Hamas.But even by Mr Erdogan's standards, the rhetoric was extreme. What Israel's prime minister was doing in Gaza, he said, "is not any less than what Hitler did".Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu hit back, saying "Erdogan, who commits genocide against the Kurds, who holds a world record for imprisoning journalists who oppose his rule, is the last person who can preach morality to us".Mr Erdogan has made comparisons with Nazi Germany in the past, but the current war of words has put into sharp focus just how bitter Turkish-Israeli relations have become, just months after a significant upturn.In the latest broadside against Israel, Turkey announced on Tuesday that it had detained 33 people suspected of working for Israeli intelligence service Mossad in raids across eight provinces. The operation, carried out with Turkey's MIT intelligence agency, followed reports that Israel intended to hunt down members of Hamas abroad, including in Turkey.Turkey has stepped up support for Gaza since 7 October, for example bringing dozens of patients from Gaza to Turkey for treatment. Turkey's health minister himself accompanied the casualties en route from Egypt.When Hamas attacked Israel, Mr Erdogan used relatively measured language, urging both sides to remain calm. But as Israel's military response intensified, his rhetoric became increasingly fierce, calling Hamas "freedom fighters" and Israel's actions "genocide".This hostility to Israel plays to President Erdogan's support base in Turkey, says Helin Sari Ertem, Associate Professor of International Relations at Istanbul Medeniyet University. "Palestine has long been a cause for Turkey and the Turkish people, covering almost all political tendencies," she says. "Consequently, it is not possible for Turkish governments to consider the Palestine-Israeli conflict only as a foreign policy issue; as it definitely is a game-changer in domestic politics."In the second half of the 20th Century, Israel and Turkey enjoyed close economic and strategic relationships. Turkey was also the first country in the region to formally recognise Israel after it was founded.But it was not long after Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to office in 2002 that relations with Israel deteriorated while those with Hamas improved. In 2006, then-Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal visited Turkey following an invitation from Mr Erdogan. Hamas had by then been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US and the EU, amongst others.The first diplomatic crisis between Israel and Turkey played out before a world audience when in 2009, Mr Erdogan stormed out of a meeting during the World Economic Forum in Davos after a clash with Israel's then-President Shimon Peres over Israeli air strikes in Gaza. The Turkish leader vowed to never go back to Davos - and he has not returned since.But just a year later tensions reached breaking point when a ship, the Mavi Marmara, sailed from Istanbul to Gaza leading a flotilla of boats carrying volunteers and humanitarian aid to challenge Israel's maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip.When the Mavi Marmara refused to halt, Israeli commandos raided it in international waters and 10 Turkish citizens on board were killed in ensuing clashes. The incident led Turkey to suspend diplomatic relations with Israel for several years.According to Ms Sari Ertem, Turkey's pivot away from Israel and towards the Palestinians is due to the conservative and pro-Islamic grassroots of Mr Erdogan's AKP party.While Mr Erdogan's support for the Palestinians is sincere, she says it also aimed at calming down the conservative-nationalist political groups, which did not see sufficient reaction from the AKP in the first days of the war. The head of the main opposition Republican People's Party in Turkey, Ozgur Ozel, called on the international community to act for Gaza, and the leader of the second biggest opposition party, Meral Aksener, has branded the Israeli prime minister a "terrorist".However, this support for Hamas has come at a cost for Turkey.Turkey's frayed relationship with Israel was restored only last year and then, within months of both countries reappointing their ambassadors, the war erupted. Turkey recalled its ambassador, and Israel's envoy returned out of security concerns.Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of Gulf State Analytics, a Washington DC-based geopolitical risk consultancy, says President Erdogan is unlikely to change path. "He has his domestic supporters and constituents, and he can't ignore such pressure coming from within Turkey and his base," Mr Cafiero argues.He also says the president cannot ignore his desire to be considered as a strong Muslim leader."Erdogan is a respected head of state throughout the wider Islamic world, and he has regional and international supporters, too."Despite the rupture between the two countries, Ms Sarı Ertem believes it will not be too damaging."The anti-Israeli discourse, which becomes very much visible especially at times of serious civilian casualties caused by Israel on the Palestinian side, rarely disrupts the traditional Turkish foreign policy approach, which favours a balancing act," she says."It has always continued its relations with Israel at least economically, if not politically. Turkish-Israeli relations have proved to be quite resilient despite all the ups and downs during history."Correction 4 January 2024: This article has been amended to make clear that the Mavi Mamara boat was leading a flotilla of boats carrying aid, rather than carrying aid itself. 	
02/01/2024 12:35:00	Egypt country profile - BBC News	Egypt is the largest Arab country, and has played a central role in Middle Eastern politics.In the 1950s President Gamal Abdul Nasser pioneered Arab nationalism and the non-aligned movement, while his successor Anwar Sadat made peace with Israel and turned back to the West.Egypt's great cities - and almost all agricultural activity - are concentrated along the banks of the Nile and its delta.The economy depends heavily on agriculture, tourism, and cash remittances from Egyptians working abroad - mainly in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries.However, rapid population growth and the limited amount of arable land are straining the country's resources and economy, and political unrest has often paralysed government efforts to address the problems.President: Abdel Fattah al-SisiPresident Abdul Fattah al-Sisi won a third six-year term in December 2023. The former army chief beat three low-profile candidates - the leading opposition candidate Ahmed Tantawy had pulled out before the poll, claiming intimidation and violence against his campaign.Egypt's faltering economy and the war in Gaza were key electoral issues.Mr Sisi first became president in 2014, a year after he led the military's overthrow of his Islamist predecessor Mohammed Morsi. He won again in 2018. He will be in power until 2030, when he is barred by the constitution from running again.Under his leadership, huge sums of money have been spent on big infrastructure projects. Roads have been expanded and flyovers built. A new capital costing billions of dollars has been constructed near Cairo but is barely inhabited.Critics say this has drained much of the country's economic resources and created unprecedented levels of debt that have crippled the economy.Egypt is a major regional media player. Its TV and film industries supply much of the Arab-speaking world with content and its press is influential.TV is the favourite medium and there are several big hitters in the sector, including the state broadcaster.The authorities have been increasing controls over traditional and social media to an unprecedented degree. Reporters Without Borders says Egypt is "one of the world's biggest prisons" for journalists.Some key dates in Egypt's history:3150BC - Egypt is unified under Menes, leading to a series of dynasties that rule the country for the next three millennia.c. 2700-2200BC -  Old Kingdom. Sees building of numerous pyramids, most notably the Third Dynasty pyramid of Djoser and the Fourth Dynasty Giza pyramids.c. 2181-2055 BC - First Intermediate Period.

Noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs, including Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti, Tutankhamun and Ramesses II. 525BC - Achaemenid Persians, led by Cambyses II, began their conquest of Egypt.332BC - Egypt falls to Alexander the Great as part of his conquest of Achaemenid Persia.323BC - Alexander dies.305-30BC - Greek general Ptolemy and his descendants rule as pharaohs. 30BC - Egypt falls to Octavian - the future Roman emperor Augustus - after his forces defeat those of rival Mark Anthony and Egyptian Queen Cleopatra at the naval battle of Actium in 27BC.  Egypt is a key province of the Roman, and later the Byzantine empires.639-642AD - Byzantine Egypt conquered by Muslim Arab armies. Muslim rulers remain in control of Egypt for the next six centuries.1250-1517 - Mamluk Egypt. The country is ruled by a caste of freed slave soldiers. 1260 - The Mamluks under Sultan Qutuz and Baybars rout the Mongols halting their southward expansion.1517 - Ottoman Turks conquer Egypt, which becomes part of the Ottoman empire, but a semi-autonomous province under the Mamluks.1798 - French troops led by Napoleon Bonaparte invade.1801 - Defeat of French forces by Ottomans and British.1805 - Ottoman Albanian commander Muhammad Ali establishes dynasty that rules until 1952, although nominally part of the Ottoman Empire.1867 - Egypt becomes a Khedivate with the Ottoman Empire1869 - Suez Canal is completed in partnership with France, but it and other infrastructure projects nearly bankrupt the country and lead to gradual British takeover.1882 - British troops defeat Egyptian army and take control of country.1914 - World War One.

01/01/2024 22:00:00	Robert Pether: Australian jailed in Iraq reaches 1,000-day milestone - BBC News	An Australian man whose family argue he is being "held hostage" in Iraq has now spent 1,000 days in prison. Robert Pether was jailed in 2021 on fraud charges, but the UN has described it as an arbitrary detention.After three Christmases behind bars, his family says Mr Pether has hit "rock bottom" and that his health is rapidly deteriorating. His lawyer is calling on the Australian government to urgently secure the father of three's release. Desree Pether worries that her husband - who has lost a third of his body weight since being arrested - may die in prison and never see his children Flynn 20, Oscar 18, and Nala 11, again. "There's no light at the end of the tunnel and so many moments have been stolen from us," she told the BBC."Nala wrote to Santa this year asking if he could stop by Iraq and pick up her dad up on the way through - I said that Santa can't get involved in political matters."A mechanical engineer, Mr Pether had gone to Iraq to rebuild its Central Bank headquarters in Baghdad. But a contract dispute between the bank and his employer - CME Consulting - landed Mr Pether and his Egyptian colleague Khalid Radwan in prison, after the bank accused the men of stealing money from the project. After being held without charge for almost six months, and then subjected to a speedy trial, the two were each given a five-year jail sentence and slapped with a joint fine of $12m (A$17.5m, £9.4m). However, a 2022 report from the UN determined that the case contravened international law and that Mr Pether and Mr Khalid had been subjected to "abusive and coercive" interrogations. Iraq's government has previously denied allegations of ill treatment, but the matter is now under investigation by the UN's Special Rapporteur on torture. And earlier this year, the International Chamber of Commerce's (ICC) Court of Arbitration ruled that Iraq's central bank was at fault in the dispute with CME and ordered it to pay $13m to the company. UK human rights lawyer Peter Griffin, who is representing Mr Pether, says the ICC finding "completely undercuts Iraq's argument that Robert's imprisonment is justified" by the "supposed wrongdoings" of the company he worked for. "That is now totally disproven and cannot provide the basis for his incarceration," he told the BBC. Mr Griffin believes that Iraq is holding Mr Pether "in the hope that it can parlay his release into some sort of financial gain" and says that the Australian government needs to "up its game". "We have all seen the great lengths that some countries will go to secure the release of their nationals in similar situations... if Robert was from the US or UK, he would have been home long ago."  A spokesperson for Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says officials have "consistently advocated for Mr Pether's rights and welfare at all levels", but that the government cannot "intervene in another country's legal processes". 	
01/01/2024 21:47:00	Israel says war in Gaza expected to continue throughout 2024 - BBC News	The Israeli military has said it expects the conflict in Gaza to continue throughout 2024. In a new year's message, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman said troop deployments were being adjusted to prepare for "prolonged fighting".  Daniel Hagari said some troops - especially reservists - would be withdrawn to allow them to regroup. "These adaptations are intended to ensure the planning and preparation for continuing the war in 2024," he said."The IDF must plan ahead out of an understanding that there will be additional missions and the fighting will continue the rest of the year."He said that some reservists would leave Gaza "as soon as this week" to allow them to "re-energise ahead of the coming operations".Some 21,978 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Its latest update said 56,697 people in Gaza had been wounded over the same period.The figures included 156 people killed and 246 injured in the last 24 hours, the ministry added. The latest war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.Israel continued its bombardment of Gaza up until the end of what has been a dark year in the region. The IDF said it killed a senior Hamas commander involved in the 7 October attack, Adil Mismah, in an overnight strike on the town of Deir al-Balah.The Gaza health ministry reported at least 48 deaths in overnight bombing in Gaza City. Witnesses told the AFP news agency that another strike killed 20 people sheltering at Al-Aqsa University in the city's west. Another strike on Monday morning was said to have killed at least 10 people in the al-Maghazi refugee camp.The BBC has not been able to verify the latest battlefield reports.A resident of northern Gaza displaced to the south of the enclave highlighted the contrast between New Year celebrations around the world and the situation in Gaza."Tonight the sky in world countries will be lit by firecrackers, and joyful laughs will fill the air," Zainab Khalil, 57, told Reuters on Sunday. "In Gaza our skies are now filled with Israeli missiles and tank shells that land on innocent, homeless civilians." The UN says 85% of Gaza's 2.4 million people - almost two million - have now been displaced.Thousands of doses of vaccines against childhood diseases, including polio and measles, have been delivered to Gaza, to help tackle a growing health emergency, Reuters reports. The news agency quoted the Palestinian health ministry as saying that supplies estimated to cover vaccinations for up to 14 months had entered through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Speaking from Rafah, Ayadil Saparbekov from the World Health Organization told the BBC that vaccines were crucial because of the conditions in which Gazans were living. "Thousands of people live together in overcrowded camps with very poor water conditions, poor hygiene and very poor sanitation - these are all breeding grounds for various diseases," he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that "the war is at its height"."We are fighting on all of the fronts," he said. "We have huge success but we also have painful cases. Achieving victory will require time."As the (army) chief of staff has said, the war will continue for many more months."Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for Palestinians to leave Gaza and make way for Israelis who could "make the desert bloom". The official line from the Israeli government is that Gazans will eventually be able to return to their homes, though it has yet to outline how or when this will be possible. Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and southern Israel as it saw in the new year, with Israeli missile defence systems intercepting rockets fired from Gaza, AFP reported.One man who was in Tel Aviv celebrating the new year with friends said: "I was terrified, like it was the first time I saw missiles. It's terrifying."Hamas's military wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said in a video posted on social media that it carried out both attacks.They said M90 rockets were used in "response to the massacres of civilians" perpetrated by Israel.	
01/01/2024 07:31:00	Red Sea: UK defence secretary says British forces will repel Houthi attacks - BBC News	Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has said British forces are ready to act against Houthi rebels that target cargo ships in the Red Sea.In a newspaper article, he said the UK was "willing to take direct action" to protect the key shipping lane.Highlighting how a British warship shot down a suspected attack drone in the Red Sea in December, Mr Shapps said "we won't hesitate to take further action".The Houthis have targeted foreign ships since the Israel-Hamas war started. The Iran-backed rebel group has declared support for Hamas and has said it targets ships travelling to Israel, launching more than 100 drone and missile attacks. The US and British warships have been shooting down these missiles and drones, at huge cost, but are now warning the Houthis to stop or risk military retaliation.In his article in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Shapps wrote: "The Houthis should be under no misunderstanding: we are committed to holding malign actors accountable for unlawful seizures and attacks."He added: "Continued Red Sea aggression risks miscalculation and escalation which could trigger a region-wide conflict."If the Red Sea was not protected, he wrote, "it risks emboldening those looking to threaten elsewhere including in the South China Sea and Crimea".Mr Shapps said the situation was "a test for the international community" and that the UK needed to "stand firm with our allies".The US launched an international naval operation in December to protect ships in the area. Countries including the UK, Canada, France, Bahrain, Norway and Spain have joined.As part of that alliance, HMS Diamond - a British Type 45 Destroyer - shot down a suspected attack drone that month. The Ministry of Defence said it was the first time in decades that the Royal Navy had shot an aerial target in anger.On Sunday, the US Navy said it destroyed Houthi "small boats" whose crew tried to board a container ship in the Red Sea. Helicopters from nearby US warships responded to a distress call - and, after being fired upon, sank three boats "in self-defence".The crews were killed and the fourth boat fled the area.The problem for the US, UK and their allies is that targeting the Houthis' missile launch sites would seriously escalate the current crisis in the Middle East, potentially pulling the West and Iran into direct confrontation. It would also portray the West - as viewed in the Arab world - as joining in the Gaza conflict on Israel's side.The Red Sea is one of the world's most important shipping lanes as it links markets in Europe with Asia. Around 12% of global trade passes through the Bab El Mandeb Strait, near to where the Houthis are targeting shipping.Analysts warn that the Houthi attacks could see a rise in prices, as it is also one of the most important routes for oil and liquefied natural gas shipments produced in the Middle East.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.	
31/12/2023 16:44:00	US Navy helicopters destroy Houthi boats in Red Sea after attempted hijack - BBC News	The US Navy has destroyed Houthi "small boats" whose crew attempted to board a container ship in the Red Sea.Four vessels from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen fired upon the Maersk Hangzhou and got within metres of the ship, the US military said. Helicopters from nearby US warships responded to a distress call - and, after being fired upon, sank three boats "in self-defence".The crews were killed and the fourth boat fled the area.A Houthi spokesperson said the vessel had refused to respond to warning calls, and that 10 of its group members were dead or missing after the incident. Houthi forces have been attacking ships in the Red Sea since November, launching more than 100 drone and missile attacks on vessels passing through the vital shipping lane.The Iranian-backed Yemeni rebel group has previously claimed its attacks are directed at vessels linked to Israel, in response to the war in Gaza. The commercial ship targeted, the Maersk Hangzhou, is registered to Singapore and operated and owned by a Danish firm, US Central Command (Centcom) said.The four Houthi boats attacked at around 06:30 Yemeni time (03:30 GMT) with mounted weapons and small arms, getting within 20m (66ft) of the container ship, which the crew "attempted to board". The ships crew issued a distress call and a security team returned fire, Centcom said.Helicopters from the nearby USS Eisenhower aircraft carrier and USS Gravely destroyer responded to the call for help and were shot at while "in the process of issuing verbal calls to the small boats".The helicopters "returned fire in self-defence, sinking three of the four small boats, and killing the crews", Centcom said. It added that the fourth boat "fled the area" and no damage had been recorded to US personnel or equipment.It was the second attack on the Hangzhou in 24 hours, after the ship was targeted on Saturday. Centcom said anti-ship missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled areas, and the destroyers Gravely and Laboon responded. Maersk said the attack happened at about 17:30 GMT. It confirmed that its vessel was "hit by an unknown object" but there was "no indication of fire on board".Maersk, one of the largest shipping companies in the world, has paused sailings through the Red Sea for 48 hours. The firm had only resumed using the route a few days ago, after the US and its allies launched a mission to protect ships in the area. Previously, its ships had diverted on a much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope because of the recent attacks on shipping. A US Navy admiral told the AP news agency Saturday's missile attack was the first successful strike since a global patrol was launched on 18 December.Centcom said while the ships were responding to the distress call, two anti-ship missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled areas at the pair of US navy vessels.The USS Gravely destroyed the inbound ballistic missiles, Centcom said, adding it was the twenty-third "illegal attack by the Houthis on international shipping" since 19 November.Centcom added the Maersk Hangzhou was "reportedly seaworthy and there are no reported injuries" on board.Separately, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) organisation reported an incident in the Red Sea about 55 nautical miles (101km) to the south-west of the Yemeni port of Hodeidah.The organisation said an unidentified ship had reported "a loud bang accompanied by a flash on the port bow of the vessel", and several explosions. No damage was recorded and all members of the crew were reported unhurt, with the vessel escaping the area to a nearby port, the statement said. The rise in Houthi attacks over several weeks has led many shipping firms, including Maersk, to divert their vessels away from the Red Sea - instead travelling around the Horn of Africa.To reach the Suez Canal in Egypt - which connects to the Mediterranean Sea - ships must pass through the tiny Bab al-Mandab Strait, just off the coast of Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen.The Iranian-sponsored rebels have previously claimed to only target "Israel-linked" commercial ships in response to the war in Gaza, saying the attacks are an attempt to stop Israeli attacks on Palestinians. In a statement on Sunday, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said he told Iran's foreign minister that Tehran "shares responsibility for preventing these attacks given their long-standing support to the Houthis".In an interview with AP, US Navy Vice Admiral Brad Cooper said the Houthis did not seem to be ending their "reckless" attacks in light of a new maritime taskforce designed to combat them.Earlier in December, the US launched Operation Prosperity Guardian - an international coalition to safeguard shipping in the the region.Vice Adm Cooper added that 1,200 commercial ships had passed through the Red Sea since the operation was launched, with none hit by drone or missile strikes until Saturday. After the international taskforce was announced, the US Department of Defense said the Houthis had carried out over 100 drone and ballistic missile attacks since November. These attempted strikes targeted 10 commercial ships linked to more than 35 different countries, it added.The Red Sea is one of the world's most important shipping lanes as it links markets in Europe with Asia.Analysts have warned the attacks could see a rise in prices, as it is also one of the most important routes for oil and liquefied natural gas shipments produced in the Middle East.	
30/12/2023 21:24:00	Israel-Gaza war: Displaced Gazans 'living in the open', UN says - BBC News	Many displaced Gazans are living "in the open, in the parks," Juliette Touma of the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has told the BBC.According to the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA), at least 100,000 people have fled to Rafah - which borders Egypt in Gaza's south - in recent days.UNRWA's Ms Touma said the UN was being authorised to bring in "limited assistance".But Gaza's humanitarian needs, she said, "have massively grown".She said UNRWA continued to face "restrictions to access areas in the Gaza Strip where we should access".Israel has said it is not limiting aid and the problem is with its distribution.It launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas's deadly 7 October attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and a further 240 taken hostage.More than 21,672 people have been killed in Gaza since that date, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It says a further 56,165 Palestinians have been injured.Access to humanitarian aid in the 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide enclave has been tightly controlled since the start of the war. At the start of its military campaign, Israeli forces focused on Gaza's north. But more recently, they have been pounding Khan Younis in southern Gaza, which they see as a stronghold for Hamas.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a TV address on Saturday evening that Israel was "fighting on all fronts". He echoed remarks by the chief of general staff, saying the war would go on "for many months", until Israel achieved "the release of all our hostages and the dismantlement of Hamas".Speaking from Rafah, UNRWA's Gaza director Tom White told the BBC there were "well over a million people" seeking safety in the city.Mr White said that for "hundreds of thousands of people" seeking safety in Rafah, "there are no spots left" in shelters - which included UNRWA schools and other municipal facilities.He echoed comments made by Ms Touma, explaining that "hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people are now sleeping in the open under flimsy pieces of plastic" as a result of the overcrowding.In its latest report, UNRWA said up to 1.9m people have been displaced across the Gaza Strip since the start of the war. According to OCHA, the most recent wave of displacement into Rafah is due to intense fighting in Khan Younis and other parts of the territory.Residents in Khan Younis have reported intense gun battles between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters. Elsewhere in Gaza on Saturday, fighting was also reported in the Nuseirat refugee camp, Maghazi and in al-Bureij.In a statement on X, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Arabic-language spokesman warned that the main north-south road in Gaza, the Salah al-Din, was a "battlefield" and "dangerous to reach".Meanwhile, a third UN body - the World Health Organization (WHO) - has again warned of a spike in the spread of infectious diseases across Gaza's displaced community.WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there had been a rise in the number of diseases across Gaza between mid-October and mid-December. He said that across UN shelters there had been some 136,400 cases of diarrhoea, 55,400 cases of lice and scabies, and 126 cases of meningitis.

30/12/2023 01:06:00	Why 2023 was an uncomfortable year for the West - BBC News	The past 12 months have seen a number of setbacks for the US, Europe and other major democracies on the international politics stage. None has been disastrous, for now. But they point to a shifting balance of power away from the US-dominated, Western values that have held sway for years. On many fronts, the wind is blowing in the wrong direction for Western interests. Here's why, and what benefits could still emerge from changes under way:Despite some recent successes in the Black Sea, the war is not going well for Ukraine. That means, by extension, it is going badly for Nato and the EU, which have bankrolled Ukraine's war effort and its economy to the tune of tens of billions of dollars. This time last year, hopes were high in Nato that, supplied with modern military equipment and intensive training in Western countries, Ukraine's army could press home the advantage it had gained that autumn and push the Russians out of much of the territory they had seized. That hasn't happened.The problem has been one of timing. Nato countries took a long time making their mind up about whether they dared send modern Main Battle Tanks like Britain's Challenger 2 and Germany's Leopard 2 to Ukraine, in case it provoked President Vladimir Putin into some sort of rash retaliation. In the end, the West delivered the tanks, President Putin did nothing. But by the time they were ready to be deployed on the battlefield in June, Russian commanders had looked at the map and rightly guessed where Ukraine's main effort was going to be. Ukraine, they figured, would want to advance south through Zaporizhzhia oblast towards the Sea of Azov, driving a wedge through Russian lines, splitting them in two and cutting off Crimea.The Russian army may have performed abysmally in its attempts to seize Kyiv in 2022, but where it excels is in defence. All that time that Ukrainian brigades were getting trained up in Britain and elsewhere during the first half of 2023, and while the tanks were being shipped eastwards to the front, Russia was building the biggest, most extensive lines of defensive fortifications in modern history. Anti-tank mines, anti-personnel mines, bunkers, trenches, tank traps, drones and artillery have all combined to thwart Ukraine's plans. Its much-vaunted counter-offensive has failed.For Ukraine and the West, the metrics are nearly all going in the wrong direction. Ukraine is running critically short of ammunition and soldiers. Congress is holding up the White House's attempts to push through a $60bn military support package. Hungary is holding up the EU's €50bn aid package.One or both may eventually get through, but that may be too late. Ukrainian forces are already having to switch to the defensive. Meanwhile, Moscow has put its economy on a war footing, devoting one-third of its national budget to defence while throwing thousands of men and thousands of artillery shells at Ukraine's front lines. Obviously this situation is deeply disappointing for Ukraine, which had hoped by now to have turned the tide of war in its favour. But why does it matter to the West? It matters because President Putin, who personally ordered this invasion nearly two years ago, needs only to hold on to the territory he has seized (roughly 18% of Ukraine) to proclaim a victory. Nato has emptied its armouries and committed everything short of going to war in order to support its ally, Ukraine. All potentially ending in an embarrassing failure to reverse the Russian invasion. Meanwhile, the Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, all Nato members - are convinced that if Mr Putin can succeed in Ukraine, he will come for them within five years. The Russian president is a wanted man. In theory. In March 2023, he was indicted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, along with his Commissioner for Children's Rights, for war crimes committed against Ukrainian children. The West hoped this would make him an international pariah and bottle him up in his own country, unable to travel for fear of arrest and deportation to The Hague. That hasn't happened. Since that indictment, President Putin has been to Kyrgyzstan, China, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, getting a red-carpet welcome each time. He has also taken part virtually in the Brics summit in South Africa. Round after round of EU sanctions were supposed to bring the Russian economy to its knees, forcing Mr Putin to reverse his invasion. Yet Russia has proved to be remarkably resilient to these sanctions, sourcing many products through other countries such as China and Kazakhstan. True, the West has largely weaned itself off Russian oil and gas, but Moscow has found other willing customers, albeit at a reduced price. The fact is that while Mr Putin's invasion and brutal occupation of Ukraine is abhorrent to Western nations, it largely isn't to the rest of the world. Many nations see this as Europe's problem, with some putting the blame on Nato, saying it provoked Russia by expanding too far east. To the dismay of Ukrainians, these nations seem oblivious to the widescale torture and abuses committed by Russia's invading troops.The West, Arab ministers told me recently at a summit in Riyadh, has double standards. "Your governments are hypocrites," I was told. Why, they asked me, do you expect us to condemn Russia for killing civilians in Ukraine when you refuse a ceasefire in Gaza, where thousands of civilians are being killed?The Israel-Hamas war has clearly been catastrophic for all Gazans and for those Israelis affected by the murderous Hamas raid into southern Israel on 7 October. It has also been bad for the West. It has diverted global attention away from Nato's ally, Ukraine, as it struggles to hold off Russian advances this winter. It has diverted US munitions away from Kyiv in favour of Israel. But most of all, in the eyes of many Muslims and others around the world, it has made the US and UK appear complicit in the destruction of Gaza by protecting Israel at the UN. Russia, whose air force carpet-bombed the city of Aleppo in Syria, has seen its stock rise in the Middle East since 7 October.The war has already spread to the southern Red Sea, where Iran-backed Houthis are launching explosive drones and missiles at ships, driving up commodity prices as the world's major shipping companies are forced to divert all the way round the southern tip of Africa.Iran is under suspicion of secretly developing a nuclear weapon, which it denies. Yet despite Western efforts, it is far from isolated, having extended its military tentacles across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Gaza through proxy militias that it funds, trains and arms. This year, has seen it forge an ever-closer alliance with Moscow, which it provides with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of Shahed drones to launch at Ukraine's towns and cities. Designated as a hostile threat by several Western nations, Iran has benefited from the Gaza war by positioning itself in the Middle East as a champion of the Palestinian cause.One by one, the countries of the Sahel region of West Africa have been succumbing to military coups that have seen the expulsion of European forces that were helping to combat a jihadist insurgency in the region. The former French colonies of Mali, Burkina Faso and Central African Republic had already turned against the Europeans when in July, yet another coup saw the ousting of a pro-Western president in Niger. The last French troops have now left the country, although 600 US troops remain there in two bases. Replacing the French and international forces are the Russian mercenaries of the Wagner group, which has managed to cling on to its lucrative business deals despite the mysterious death of its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, in a plane crash in August.Meanwhile, South Africa, once seen as a Western ally, has been holding joint naval exercises with Russian and Chinese warships.The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is supposed to be under strict international sanctions because of its banned nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programme. Yet this year, it has forged close links with Russia, with its leader Kim Jong Un visiting a Russian spaceport, followed by North Korea sending a reported one million artillery shells to Russian forces fighting in Ukraine. North Korea has test-fired several intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are now believed capable of reaching most parts of the continental US. To some extent, 2023 has seen an easing of tension between Beijing and Washington, with a largely successful summit between Presidents Biden and Xi in San Francisco. But China has shown no sign of backing down on its claims over most of the South China Sea, issuing a new "standard" map that extends its claims almost right up to the coastlines of several Asia-Pacific nations. Nor has it given up its claims over Taiwan, which it has vowed to "take back", by force if necessary.Against this gloomy backdrop for the West, it is perhaps hard to see glimmers of hope. But on the plus side for the West, the Nato alliance has clearly rediscovered its defensive purpose, galvanised by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Western unanimity shown so far has surprised many, although some cracks are now beginning to appear.But it is in the Middle East where there is the greatest potential for improvement. That's partly because of the horrific scale of events which have unfolded on both sides of the Gaza-Israel border. Before 7 October, the search for a solution to the question of a future Palestinian state had largely been abandoned. A certain complacency had crept into Israel's dealings with the Palestinians that this was a problem that could somehow be managed through security measures, without having to make any serious moves towards offering them a state of their own. That formula has now been shown to be fatally flawed. One world leader after another has proclaimed that Israelis will not be able to live in the peace and security they deserve unless Palestinians can do the same.Finding a just and durable solution to a problem that stretches back into history is going to be incredibly difficult and will ultimately involve painful compromises and sacrifices on both sides if it is to succeed. But now at last, it has the world's attention.	
29/12/2023 21:19:00	South Africa files ICJ case accusing Israel of 'genocidal acts' - BBC News	South Africa has filed a case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging that Israel is engaging in "genocidal acts" in Gaza.The UN court confirmed the application concerning alleged violations of Israel's obligations under the Genocide Convention.Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it "baseless"."Israel rejects with disgust the blood libel spread by South Africa", the foreign ministry said.The ICJ, which is based in the Hague in the Netherlands, is the UN's principal judicial organ. It settles disputes between states and gives advisory opinions on international legal issues.Following its application to the ICJ, South Africa's presidency said in a statement that the country was obliged "to prevent genocide from occurring"."South Africa is gravely concerned with the plight of civilians caught in the present Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip due to the indiscriminate use of force and forcible removal of inhabitants," it said."Furthermore, there are ongoing reports of international crimes, such as crimes against humanity and war crimes, being committed as well as reports that acts meeting the threshold of genocide or related crimes... have been and may still be committed in the context of the ongoing massacres in Gaza."The 84-page document states that the "acts and omissions by Israel" are "genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group".The application asks the ICJ for a hearing to take place next week and requests that a number "provisional measures" be indicated by the court, including that Israel cease all military activities in Gaza.Lior Haiat, a spokesman for Israel's foreign affairs ministry, said South Africa's claim "constitutes despicable and contemptuous exploitation of the Court."He said South Africa was "cooperating with a terrorist organisation that is calling for the destruction of the State of Israel" and said Hamas was "responsible for the suffering of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by using them as human shields and stealing humanitarian aid from them"."Israel is committed to international law and acts in accordance with it, and directs its military efforts only against the Hamas terrorist organization and the other terrorist organizations cooperating with Hamas," Mr Haiat said."Israel has made it clear that the residents of the Gaza Strip are not the enemy, and is making every effort to limit harm to the non-involved and to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip."South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza.In early November, it recalled all of its diplomats from Israel. Israel, in turn, recalled its ambassador from Pretoria.In addition, the South African national assembly voted to suspend all diplomatic relations with Israel, but the government has not yet formally responded to the vote.South Africa previously filed a referral to a different court, the International Criminal Court (ICC), relating to alleged war crimes by Israel in Gaza. The ICC ​investigates and tries individuals charged with genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Israel does not recognise the ICC.The current war between Israel and Hamas was triggered by the 7 October Hamas attack on southern Israel, which killed about 1,200 people - most of them civilians - and saw about 240 others taken hostage.More than 21,500 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.	
29/12/2023 18:25:00	Plane stowaway in serious condition in France - BBC News	A man has been taken to intensive care after he was found in the undercarriage of a plane that flew from Algeria to France, French authorities said.The man was found in the landing gear compartment by staff after it had flown a two-and-a-half-hour flight from Oran to Paris's Orly airport.An airport source told AFP news agency he was suffering from severe hypothermia when he was found.He was not carrying any ID, prosecutors said, so his age is unclear.Some French reports say he is believed to be aged between 20 and 30, while others say he is as young as 15.He was transported to Henri-Mondor hospital in Créteil, the local prosecutor's office said. There are serious risks associated with trying to travel in the undercarriage of a plane.During the flight, temperatures can drop to as low as -63C (-81F), bringing on hypothermia. A lack of oxygen is also a lethal danger.In 2019, a suspected stowaway was found dead on the roof of a house in London after falling from the landing gear of a flight travelling into Heathrow Airport from Kenya.Another stowaway was found alive in the wheel section of a plane that landed at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport from South Africa in 2022.	
29/12/2023 04:36:00	Thousands of Palestinians flee central Gaza as Israeli troops advance - BBC News	An estimated 150,000 Palestinians are being forced to flee areas of central Gaza, the UN has said, as Israeli forces advance on refugee camps there.Witnesses and Hamas's armed wing reported that tanks had reached the eastern outskirts of Bureij camp.Israel's military recently expanded its ground offensive to target Bureij and nearby Nuseirat and Maghazi camps.Israeli bombardment also killed dozens of people across Gaza on Thursday, the Hamas-run health ministry said.Egypt has confirmed that it has put forward a three-stage proposal to stop the fighting which ends with a ceasefire. A Hamas delegation is said to have arrived in Cairo to give its response to the plan.The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage. More than 21,300 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during 11 weeks of fighting, according to the health ministry.The Israeli military has called for the evacuation of a strip of land stretching across central Gaza that includes Bureij and Nuseirat camps, and told the almost 90,000 residents and 61,000 displaced people in the affected areas to move southwards to the town of Deir al-Balah.However, the UN warned on Thursday that they had nowhere to go because Deir al-Balah was already overcrowded, with several hundred thousand displaced people sheltering there. The UN says that Rafah - which had already become the most densely populated town in Gaza - has seen about 100,000 new arrivals in recent days as Israeli ground forces have pushed into new neighbourhoods.Omar, 60, said he had been forced to flee Bureij along with at least 35 members of his family. "That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must," he told Reuters news agency by phone. "We are now in a tent in Deir al-Balah because of this brutal Israeli war."Tom White, Gaza director for UN relief agency UNRWA, said more and more people were being pushed into the southern Gaza town of Rafah, "so more people into a very small strip of land that cannot support them".On Thursday evening, Gaza's health ministry reported that 20 people had been killed in an Israeli air strike on a building in Rafah that was reportedly housing displaced civilians.On Thursday morning, the ministry's spokesman announced that 50 people had been killed in Israeli strikes in Maghazi, the northern town of Beit Lahia and in the southern city of Khan Younis.The deadliest incident was in Beit Lahia, where Palestinian media reported that 30 were killed when a block of four residential buildings was destroyed.A local TV journalist, Bassel Kheir al-Din, told the Associated Press news agency that 12 members of his family were buried beneath the rubble of one of the buildings and presumed dead, and that nine of their neighbours were missing.  The Palestinian Red Crescent said 10 people had been killed when Israeli shellfire hit an apartment near al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis, a day after a similar incident in front of the facility reportedly left 31 dead. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters on Wednesday that the city was "a main Hamas terror centre". He also said troops were fighting in the Bureij area for a third day, adding that they were "eliminating many terrorists and destroying terrorist infrastructure".Residents told Reuters that the heavy fighting continued on Thursday, with Israeli tanks advancing on the densely populated Bureij camp from the north and east. Hamas posted a video showing what it said was its fighters targeting Israeli soldiers and vehicles.In a separate development, the IDF said it regretted the "harm caused to uninvolved civilians" resulting from an air strike in Maghazi on Sunday that killed at least 70 people, according to Gaza's health ministry.Its statement said fighter jets had "struck two targets adjacent to which Hamas operatives were located".In Israel, thousands of teenagers took part in a march to demand a new deal to return the more than 100 hostages still being held by Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza. Many of the demonstrators were from the communities worst affected by the 7 October attacks."I'm from Kibbutz Kfar Aza," Shiri Khiyali told the BBC. "I was there on 7 October. My people were kidnapped. We want them back. We want them back now." Separately, there was a new call from UN human rights chief Volker Türk urging Israel to stop what he called "unlawful" killings in the occupied West Bank. A report said the UN had verified the killing of 300 Palestinians by Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank since 7 October.A spokeswoman for Israel's prime minister dismissed the report as quite ridiculous and said it belittled the major security threats to Israelis.	
29/12/2023 04:30:00	Qatar commutes India ex-navy officers' death penalty - BBC News	A court in Qatar has commuted the death sentences of eight former Indian naval officers, India's foreign ministry has said.A ministry statement said the "sentences have been reduced" but did not specify what new penalty they would face.Neither Qatar nor India have revealed the specific charges against the men.FT and Reuters have reported, citing unnamed sources, that the men were charged with spying for Israel.A spokesperson for Israel's embassy in India refused to comment, saying it was "not an Israeli matter"."Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of proceedings of this case, it would not be appropriate to make any further comment at this juncture," India's foreign ministry said on Thursday.Families of the imprisoned officers said they would appeal in Qatar's top court for reducing their sentences, the Indian Express newspaper reported on Friday.  In October, India said it was "deeply shocked" after the men were sentenced to death. It later filed an appeal against the court verdict.The arrest of the men last year made front-page headlines in India, but there has been little confirmed information about the charges against them - the court's order has not been made public.The Indian government has said that the eight men were employees of a private company called Al Dahra, but they have been widely reported to be former personnel of the Indian Navy. Last year, in parliament, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar described them as "ex-servicemen" of the country. The families of some of the men have also confirmed their identities and background in the Navy to local media.Earlier this month, India's ambassador to Qatar met the men in prison.On Thursday, India said its ambassador and other officials were present in the Court of Appeal of Qatar along with the family members of the men during the hearing. "The detailed judgement is awaited. We are in close touch with the legal team as well as the family members to decide on the next steps," the ministry statement added.	
28/12/2023 18:33:00	Israel Gaza war: Israel warns Hezbollah and Lebanon over border fighting - BBC News	Israel will act to remove Hezbollah from the border with Lebanon if the militia group's attacks continue, an Israeli minister has warned.Benny Gantz said the Israeli military would intervene if militants do not stop firing on northern Israel.Time for a diplomatic solution was running out, he added.Meanwhile, the head of the Israel Defense Forces said troops were in "very high readiness" for more fighting in the north. "Our first task is to restore security and the sense of security to the residents in the north, and this will take time," Chief of the General Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said, after conducting a "situational assessment".Cross-border exchanges of fire have been escalating since Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israel. On Wednesday, Hezbollah launched its highest number of cross-border attacks in a day since 8 October, security sources told Reuters.It has led to concerns the conflict in Gaza could become wider across the region."The situation on Israel's northern border demands change," Mr Gantz told a news conference on Wednesday night. "The stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out. If the world and the Lebanese government don't act in order to prevent the firing on Israel's northern residents, and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF will do it."But the Lebanese ambassador in the UK, Rami Mortada, said his country was on the receiving end of attacks and "the party that should hold back is Israel"."We are not interested in escalation - all sides need to de-escalate," he told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme.Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on a visit to troops near the border that Israel would "single-handedly turn Beirut and South Lebanon, not far from here, into Gaza and Khan Yunis" if Hezbollah started an all-out war. Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim organisation - is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League. Funded by Iran, it is one of the most heavily-armed, non-state military forces in the world.In 2006, a full-blown war between Hezbollah and Israel was triggered when Hezbollah carried out a deadly cross-border raid, with Israeli troops invading southern Lebanon.At the border, there has been an increase in rocket fire and the use of weaponised drones by Hezbollah this week, with Israeli war planes quick to respond. On Thursday, Israeli forces said they intercepted a drone crossing into their territory from Lebanon. And on Wednesday, state media in Lebanon reported that a Hezbollah fighter and two of his relatives had been killed in an Israeli air strike.The attack reportedly hit a house in Bint Jbeil, a town about 2km (1.2 miles) from the border with Israel. A Hezbollah statement said one of the victims, Ibrahim Bazzi, was an Australian citizen visiting his family.More than 100 people have been killed in Lebanon since October - most of them Hezbollah fighters but civilians, including three journalists, are also among the dead.On the Israeli side, at least four civilians and nine soldiers are known to have died on the Lebanon border since hostilities began. Thousands of civilians living in dozens of communities in the area have been evacuated by the army.Meanwhile, Unifil - the UN peacekeeping force that has operated in southern Lebanon since 1978 - called on Lebanese authorities to investigate after one of its troops was wounded in the country's south.Unifil said a patrol was attacked "by a group of young men" in Taybeh, with a vehicle also damaged.Hezbollah's leadership praised the unprecedented cross-border attack launched by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others were taken hostage.More than 21,100 people have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza - mostly children and women - during 11 weeks of fighting, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Thousands of Palestinian families in Gaza are trying to find shelter as Israel broadens its ground offensive across the centre and south of the territory.	
28/12/2023 06:54:00	Travelling the world's Belfasts by motorbike - BBC News	If you ask most people how long it would take to travel to all the places called Belfast in the world, they'd probably say not very long.After all, how many Belfasts could there be? Well, it turns out other than the original, and most famous Belfast, there are at least 24 others - and one man has made it his mission to visit them all. What's more, he's doing it on a motorbike built in the 1970s.Glengormley man Sean Drysdale has already completed the first part of his quest, travelling from Belfast, South Africa, back to Northern Ireland.In the spring, he plans to visit the Belfasts of North America - all 19 of them.Sean, a retired doctor, first had the idea when he visited South Africa in 1982 and became aware of the town of Belfast, Mpumalanga."It took me 40 years to basically find the time to do it," he said."So I did that trip [South Africa to Northern Ireland] in 2019-2020 and then it just occurred to me that there were other Belfasts about and thought to myself that would make an interesting ride to just go to them all."There's two in Canada, 17 in the States and then there's one each in New Zealand, Australia and Jamaica."His 2024 trip will take the 66-year-old on a "serpentine journey", starting in Canada, where he'll go from Prince Edward Island to Ontario.Then he'll cross the border into the US and visit (deep breath) Maine, Pennsylvania, North and South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Nevada, California before finishing up in Washington state. The plan is to do it all in six months, from April to October."I'm not planning on just getting on the bike and seeing how quickly I can get there," he said."I travel at a leisurely pace and there's a destination - I'm not trying to catch a train or anything."The idea's to do it all on the same bike, this is a bike that I've owned since 1978 and I rebuilt it before I did the Africa trip"Apart from the challenge of the trip, I think it will be interesting to see how all these places came to be called Belfast."Sean has visited cities in the US before, but this road trip will take him to much more remote places."I think it'll be quite an eye-opener because a lot of these places will be in the middle of nowhere, so you'll get to see, I suppose, the real United States as opposed to the Hollywood version," he said.It would be fair to say the same about his African trip.It started in Zimbabwe, where Sean was working, then took in South Africa's Belfast, Mozambique, Malawi, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan before he travelled to Saudi Arabia.His original plan was to travel through Iran to Turkey and then through Europe, but that changed when he broke his foot in Sudan."In the end I just turned left and went up through Saudi into Jordan, then I couldn't get any further north so I had to go into Israel," he said."Took a boat from Israel to Italy - a cargo boat but they took passengers."So I put the bike on the boat and rode up through Italy with Covid hot on my heels."He booked AirBnbs and occasionally hotels, couch surfed and sometimes used a tent he had brought with him."Just drove off the road a bit, pitched my tent and camped in the middle of nowhere which was great, arguably some of the best bits of it," he said.Sean said the most surprising leg of the journey was Saudi Arabia, where he was put in touch with a man who was active in a bikers group."From there on I was sort of taken under their wing, introduced to different people and passed from one group to another," Sean said."When I was travelling around the country they'd send me from one town and arrange for me to meet up with people at the next town who would look after me down there."He also had an encounter with royalty."By accident I ended up in this place I thought I was supposed to be spending the night and it turned out to be a sort of regional administrative headquarters," he said "They introduced me to a prince, a member of the royal family, who was the regional director or governor."They put me up in a five-star hotel for three days and he insisted that I travel round with him on one of his days out - went to some of the meetings he was attending and various ceremonies and stuff - then sent me on my way days later."He said throughout his journey "the willingness of people to help was just amazing" including paying for his fuel when they heard his story."One time I fell off going down a very bad road in Tanzania," he said."The trucks that were following me stopped to make sure I was all right."When the bike wouldn't start, they loaded it onto the back of a trailer, took him to the next town where he could get spend the night and get the bike going again. He recalled a similar experience in Sudan when his bike broke down, and a man stopped to help him push it to a nearby compound where he spent the night."The next day they arranged a truck to take me to the next town and sort things out there."After travelling up through Europe he returned to Northern Ireland during the first Covid lockdown."I think it was at about Newry, I was riding along and it suddenly just dawned on me that I had actually done it, something I'd been thinking about for nearly 40 years," he said."Then I got into Belfast, which was deserted."I wasn't really expected a big crowd clapping me as I rode along Donegall Place, but it was sort of 'right, well that's it now and how do I get a picture'."Preparations are already under way for the North American trip, including contacting an online forum for the Honda 750 motorbike he's owned since 1978."It should be interesting travelling through and trying to meet up with some of these guys en route - some of them want to travel part of the route with me," he said."The big question will be what do I do once I get to the west coast - do I keep going west or do I make another plan?"	
27/12/2023 17:16:00	Israel expanding ground offensive into central Gaza refugee camps - BBC News	Israel is expanding its ground offensive into Palestinian refugee camps in central Gaza, as it warns the war with Hamas will last for months.The UN has expressed grave concern after Israeli strikes reportedly killed dozens of people in Bureij, Nuseirat and Maghazi camps in recent days.Heavy fighting is also continuing to the south, in the city of Khan Younis.Meanwhile, the Palestinian president has described what is happening in Gaza as "beyond a war of annihilation".The Hamas-run health ministry has said at least 195 people have been killed across the territory over the past 24 hours.More than 21,100 have been killed - mostly children and women - during 11 weeks of fighting, according to the ministry.  The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.Palestinian media cited local officials and witnesses as saying dozens of civilians were killed as Israel kept up its strikes across Gaza overnight.Heavy bombardment was reported in the Middle Area, particularly in Bureij, Maghazi and Nuseirat camps.In Nuseirat, Israeli warplanes targeted the homes of the Nasser and Hazouqi families, killing a number of people and wounding dozens more, according to the official Wafa news agency. Hamas-affiliated Safa news agency also reported that five had been killed in a strike on a girls school in Maghazi.Residents meanwhile told Reuters news agency that there was heavy fighting east and north of Bureij district and in the nearby village of Juhr al-Deek.There was no immediate comment from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), but spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters on Tuesday evening that its forces had "expanded the combat to the area known as the Central Camps". The IDF had earlier released videos and photos that it said showed several tanks operating on the outskirts of one of the camps, as well as a tunnel shaft and a Hamas training facility discovered in Bureij. It also reiterated an order for residents to leave more than a dozen central areas running from the Gaza-Israel perimeter to the coast, including Bureij and Nuseirat camps.According to the UN, the affected areas were home to nearly 90,000 people before the war. They also now include six shelters hosting about 61,000 displaced people, mostly from the north.The residents have been told to move immediately to shelters in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, which is already struggling to cope with several hundred thousand displaced people.The UN human rights office  said on Tuesday that it was gravely concerned about the continued bombardment of the Middle Area and its densely populated camps, citing a report from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) that Deir al-Balah's al-Aqsa hospital had admitted 131 dead following Israeli strikes on Maghazi and Bureij on Sunday. It also warned of a "deepening and already catastrophic humanitarian situation", saying that all roads connecting the three camps had been destroyed and that any shelters and hospitals still operating were critically overcrowded and under-resourced. A Palestinian woman living in the UK, Alaa, told the BBC that her family had been in Maghazi during Sunday's strikes and were "having to live with... constant loss, constant fear"."Pulling people from under the rubble and losing friends, losing family members, being displaced, losing homes," she said. "My four-year-old nephew... had to evacuate with my family the other day and he was crying, asking for his dad who was killed a month ago."The bombardment of the north and south of Gaza also continued on Wednesday. In the afternoon, the Hamas-run health ministry said 20 people had been killed in an Israeli air strike on a house where displaced people were staying near the al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis.The Palestinian Red Crescent, which runs the hospital, said dozens were killed or wounded and posted a graphic video that showed paramedics and bystanders retrieving several bodies on a street.The IDF has not yet commented on the incident, but a spokesperson did appear to confirm reports from Tuesday that Israel had handed over the bodies of 80 Palestinians after checking there were no hostages among them."During the war, bodies have been transported to Israel for an identification procedure as part of our effort to locate the hostages and the missing persons," the spokesperson said.It is believed that more than 100 hostages remain alive in Gaza, after 105 were released from captivity in late November, most of them Israeli women and children. A number of bodies have also been recovered and Israeli officials have confirmed the deaths of more than 20 people who had been held by Hamas.Israel's been under pressure from its closest ally, the US, to lower the intensity of its military operations in Gaza and reduce the number of civilian deaths, but there is no sign of that happening yet. The IDF's chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, warned that the fighting with Hamas was taking place in "a complex area" and would therefore "continue for many more months". "There are no magic solutions or shortcuts in the fundamental dismantling of a terrorist organisation, except persistent and determined fighting, and we are very, very determined," he added. "We will also get to the Hamas leadership, whether it takes a week or months."He was speaking amid new signs of rising regional tensions with incidents linked to Iran-backed groups in the Red Sea, on the Lebanese border and in Iraq.In his first interview since the start of the war, the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - a political rival of Hamas who is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank - said it was unprecedented in Palestinian history."What's happening in the Palestinian territories is far beyond a disaster and far more than a genocide. The Palestinians have never seen anything like this," he told Egypt's ON TV.Mr Abbas also warned that the West Bank could implode at any time.On Wednesday, six Palestinians, including a 17-year-old boy, were killed in a drone strike during an Israeli raid on a refugee camp near the western West Bank town of Tulkarm, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The IDF said six "armed terrorists" were killed in an air strike after they threw explosive devices at troops carrying out an operation to arrest wanted people.	
26/12/2023 21:39:00	US hits Iran-backed militias in Iraq after attack - BBC News	The US military has attacked Iranian-backed militant groups in Iraq, hours after US personnel were injured in a drone strike on a US airbase there. The US defence chief said three sites used by Kataib Hezbollah and other groups were hit in response to attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria.The US strikes were condemned by Iraq as a "clear hostile act".The US has repeatedly targeted sites linked to militant groups in Iraq and Syria in recent years.Iraq says one person was killed and 18 others, including civilians, were injured in the US strikes.Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin said the attacks, which he called "necessary and proportionate", had been authorised by President Joe Biden.The drone strike on a US base in Irbil in Iraq's Kurdistan region injured three US military personnel, one critically, US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said.A militia collective called Islamic Resistance in Iraq, linked to Kataib Hezbollah, said it was behind the that attack.The Irbil airbase had previously been hit by rocket attacks carried out by Iranian-linked militia. Kataib Hezbollah, which is financed and armed by Iran, has been one of the most prominent groups involved in attacks on US targets in Iraq. It forms part of the Hashd al Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation), an umbrella group of militia which has been integrated into the Iraqi armed forces.Iraq is an ally of both the US and Iran, which are major foes of one another. The US has about 2,500 soldiers in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government to prevent a resurgence there of the Islamic State (IS) group. There are about 900 US military personnel in north-east Syria, also to curb IS, though the Syrian government considers their presence illegal.Meanwhile, US forces in the Red Sea said they had shot down 12 attack drones, three anti-ship missiles and two cruise missiles fired by Houthi rebels from Yemen on Sunday. Fighter jets and naval vessels from the Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group shot down the projectiles over a 10-hour period, the US military's Central Command said. There was no damage to ships in the area or reported injuries, officials added.

On Monday PM Benjamin Netanyahu warned that the campaign was "not close to being over".Israel says it hit more than 100 sites on Tuesday. It is reportedly extending ground operations to central Gaza.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 20,915 Palestinians have been killed in more than 11 weeks of fighting.The war began on 7 October after Hamas led a wave of deadly attacks on communities inside Israel. About 1.9 million have been internally displaced by Israeli bombardments since then, the UN says.Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for the UN Palestinian refugee agency (Unwra) told the BBC: "We're seeing very worrying reports of hunger and starvation in some places, and meanwhile the war continues, the displacement continues and UN shelters are overcrowded and overwhelmed."Last week US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken called on Israel to lower the intensity of its strikes to limit "harm done to civilians".On Tuesday Herzi Halevi, chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), told a news conference that the war would "continue for many more months" to ensure that "our achievements are preserved for a long time"."There are no shortcuts when it comes to thoroughly dismantling a terrorist organisation except being stubborn and determined in the fighting," he added.The IDF says Tuesday's air strikes hit 100 targets from Jabaliya in northern Gaza to Khan Yunis and Rafah in the south. There are also reports that it launched a ground offensive in refugee camps in central Gaza after ordering residents to evacuate.Internet and telephone services were again cut across the Gaza Strip.Some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed in the 7 October attacks. About 240 people were taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel says 132 are still being held.On Monday Mr Netanyahu told parliament: "We will not be able to release all the abductees without military pressure... we will not stop fighting."Israeli and Arab media say that Egypt has proposed a plan for a ceasefire.According to reports, the plan would see the phased release of all Israeli hostages and an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, ending with a suspension of Israel's offensive.A previous temporary truce deal negotiated by Qatar saw dozens of hostages released from Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. So far, both Israel and Hamas have resisted calls for a lasting ceasefire.Meanwhile Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer is Washington for talks with Mr Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.The talks will focus on "matters related to the conflict in Gaza and the return of hostages held by Hamas", National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said.

The chartered Airbus A340, which had been flying from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Nicaragua, aroused suspicion during a refuelling stop.It left with 276 passengers but 25 people including two minors remained in France after applying for asylum.Two suspected traffickers also remain in France for further investigation.However the two were set free by the courts.The Legend Airlines flight landed in Mumbai early on Tuesday local time.Photos shared by news agency ANI show several passengers sitting on plastic chairs at the Mumbai airport after the flight landed. Some of the passengers could be seen leaving the airport but BBC Marathi reports that most of them refused to answer questions from the media.The plane had initially been prevented from leaving Châlons-Vatry Airport, about 130km (81 miles) from Paris, on Thursday after authorities received an anonymous tip-off  that some passengers might be "victims of human trafficking", Parisian prosecutors say. Most of those aboard were believed to be Indian citizens working in the UAE. A third of the passengers are reported to be from India's affluent western state of Gujarat.French authorities reportedly also suspected that the people on board might have been travelling to Nicaragua before attempting to enter the US or Canada.It was not clear whether authorities had definitively determined that no crime had been committed before allowing the plane to leave.It is also unclear why the flight went to Mumbai instead of resuming its journey to Nicaragua.Legend Airlines is a Romanian charter airline with a fleet of four planes, according to the online flight tracker Flightradar.With reporting inputs from Delhi and Mumbai	
26/12/2023 03:26:00	Israel Gaza war: UN says no let-up in Israeli air strikes in Gaza - BBC News	There is no let-up in Israeli air strikes in Gaza, a UN official has told the BBC, after visiting a hospital struggling to treat the injured.Gemma Connell of the UN humanitarian agency Ocha told the BBC what she had seen at the Al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza on Monday was "absolute carnage".Many severely injured people could not be treated because the hospital was "absolutely overloaded", she said.Israel's prime minister earlier vowed to intensify the fight against Hamas.Benjamin Netanyahu said he had visited Gaza on Monday morning and that Israel's military campaign there was "not close to being over".His comments come days after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israel should lower the intensity of its strikes.In another development, the Pentagon says the US armed forces have carried out air strikes in Iraq against "Iranian-sponsored militias" in response to an attack on the Irbil air base that injured three US military personnel, one of them critically. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes had targeted three facilities used by the Iranian-backed Kataeb Hezbollah group and its affiliates. He said there had been a series of attacks by the militias on US bases in both Iraq and Syria, and stressed that the US would not hesitate to protect its people and facilities. There has been an escalation of activity by Kataeb Hezbollah and other armed militias in the region following Israel's military operation in Gaza.Tom White, director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that there were currently an estimated 150,000 people in central Gaza who had received evacuation orders from the Israeli military.Also speaking to the Newshour, Ms Connell said: "What I saw at the Al-Aqsa Hospital in [the city of] Deir al-Balah was absolute carnage."There were, she said, many casualties there with "extremely severe wounds but [who] cannot be treated because there are so many people in front of them in the line for surgery, and the hospital is absolutely overloaded."  "And some of those that I saw were people who were hit in the strike yesterday [Sunday]," she said in a reference to a reported attack on the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 70 people were killed in the Israeli strike. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had received "reports of an incident in the Maghazi camp". It added that "despite the challenges posed by Hamas terrorists operating within civilian areas in Gaza, the IDF is committed to international law including taking feasible steps to minimize harm to civilians". Ms Connell also said that while she was visiting Al-Aqsa "there were new air strikes hitting areas around the hospital in the middle area and new casualties being brought in"."Tragically I saw a nine-year-old boy with a devastating head injury who passed away," she added."When I say that there were strikes again today and casualties arriving, some of those strikes were in areas that people have been told to evacuate to, which, again goes back to the refrain that, I think, I am so sick of saying: that there is no safe place in Gaza," she said.  "And even when people are told to evacuate the places that they are fleeing to are not safe."The war began on 7 October after Hamas led a deadly attack on communities inside Israel, killing 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and seizing about 240 hostages. Israel says 132 are still being held.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said on Monday that some 20,674 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli bombardments since then. Most of the fatalities are said to be children and women.Israeli and Arab media say that Egypt has proposed a plan for a ceasefire between the two sides.According to reports, the plan would see the phased release of all Israeli hostages and an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails over the course of a month and a half, ending with a suspension of Israel's offensive.A previous temporary truce deal negotiated by Qatar saw dozens of hostages released from Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.So far, both Israel and Hamas have resisted growing calls for a ceasefire.	
26/12/2023 01:16:00	Spanish-Moroccan letters of forbidden love that were never received - BBC News	Confiscated letters written to Moroccan men from Spanish women decades ago reveal a history of taboo affairs during the colonial era."When will you come back to Spain?" The desperate-sounding plea had been carefully written out on the page, a sign of how important it was for Carmela. "Tell me that you are not looking at any other women," she wrote from Granada in 1944. But the man these words were intended for never got to read them. Carmela's international love letter did not make it to its destination in Morocco. Instead, it ended up hidden deep in the Spanish archives, in an unexpected stash of hundreds of amorous messages between Spanish women and Moroccan men. Seized between the 1930s and the 1950s, they chronicle forbidden intimate relationships. For decades, colonial authorities of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco systematically seized this mail.The boxes are full of words of passion: "I am crazy for you… I am like a goat for you," writes one woman from Valencia. Some contain photographs. Inserted in letter after letter, there are dozens of portraits of women with immaculate hairdos posing to remind their distant lovers what they looked like. One sent a picture of herself riding a bicycle, a carefree snapshot of everyday life.All were neatly filed away in envelopes by conscientious bureaucrats, and then forgotten amid routine administrative documents. They accumulated dust until they were found and published by academics Josep LluísMateo Dieste and Nieves Muriel García.Each letter contains a tantalising glimpse into an entire relationship, but each one also tells us about the repression that these relationships faced. Spanish officials tried everything they could to make these relationships impossible. As one directive stated in 1937: "As a general rule, marriages between Moroccan soldiers with Spanish women must be prevented."Since 1912, Spain had claimed sovereignty over part of Morocco as a protectorate, dividing the country into two zones, along with France. Fighters form the Berber community resisted this, most notoriously in the long and bloody Rif War between 1921 and 1926, which saw the Spanish army decimated by forces led by Abdelkrim al-Khattabi. To overcome this challenge, the Spanish government increased the number of its troops in Morocco and recruited thousands of Moroccans to serve in its army. By the 1930s a long strip along the north of the country, from the Atlantic coast in Asilah almost up to the border with Algeria in the east, was effectively administered by Spain with its capital in Tetouan. It was from the military bases in this territory that in 1936, Gen Francisco Franco launched a coup against the Republican government, starting the Spanish Civil War. As the war raged on, suddenly thousands of Moroccan men conscripted into the Spanish military were sent across the sea to Spain to fight alongside Franco's forces. Beyond the military, students, traders and other workers also joined them and ended up living around the country, in cities as well as more remote rural locations. After all, unlike many European colonial possessions, this one lay just a stone's throw away from Spain itself - at its narrowest in the Strait of Gibraltar, the Moroccan coast is only 14km (8.5 miles) away from the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula. Wherever they went, Moroccan men met Spanish women. In Salamanca, a woman named Concha met Nasar, a Moroccan soldier stationed nearby. Madly in love, she wrote to his superiors for permission to marry him in 1938. But for Spanish colonial authorities, such contact absolutely had to be banned. They expressed disgust at Concha, who they disparaged as old, "ugly, fat like a hippo and with a slight limp".  They suspected that Nasar had only shown interest because Concha happened to own a house, which is what awakened his "volcanic love".Official orders were to place "as many difficulties as possible" to prevent these relationships "without openly banning them", as one order put it in 1937. Indeed, as the Franco regime relied on the loyalty of Moroccan soldiers, they did not make such relationships explicitly illegal. Instead, they developed a whole series of means to make them impossible in practice. For example, if a woman was found to be writing to a Moroccan man, they would ban her from entering Morocco. Often, they would also ban the Moroccan man from entering Spain, rendering their relationship impossible. In 1948, a letter was intercepted between Carmen from Zaragoza to her lover Abdeselam in Morocco. The authorities in Tetouan immediately banned both from crossing to the opposite side. In the letter, Carmen gave news of their daughter, who would now grow up without ever seeing her father. The officials did not take the child into consideration.Why did they regard these relationships with such contempt? Part of the answer lies in the dictatorship's reactionary ideology. Franco's government was aggressively misogynistic, rigidly controlling the mobility of women and restricting their access to employment. It also saw itself as a defender of Catholicism, and for religious reasons, women who married Muslim men were seen as "lost to the faith". But the biggest single reason was what officials called "prestigio de raza", "the prestige of the race". For colonial rule to continue, Spain had to be seen as superior to Morocco. As the government understood marriage to be the subordination of a woman by a man, any marriage across the colonial divide would make a Spanish woman subservient to a Moroccan man. If this came to be known, it would undermine the very basis of colonial domination. By contrast, relationships between Spanish men and Moroccan women, which were plentiful in the protectorate, did not attract such extensive scrutiny and censorship as they reproduced the larger power structure of society on an intimate scale without threatening it.This was not specific to Spain: the fear of European women entering into relationships with colonised men was common across all European colonial administrations. In the neighbouring French zone, officials expressed similar disapproval for the political consequences of these relationships. The Dutch in the East Indies and the British in India saw relationships between European women and colonised men as much more threatening than the reverse, and policed them accordingly. While the range of measures to discourage these relationships went from disapproval to outright bans, the underlying rule was the same: such relationships were a threat. These letters, however, reveal that beneath the surface of colonial society, encounters were common and led to a whole range of relationships: friendships, courtships, sexual encounters and marriages. Opening them is thrilling - a window into lives that official documents rarely tell us about. But it is also unsettling - most letters never made it to their destination. It feels like an invasion of privacy, as these people never chose to be included in this archive.When Morocco became independent in 1956, the protectorate government in Tetouan shut down and its archives were mostly forgotten. They ended up mostly near Madrid, in the central archives of the administration in the university town of Alcalá de Henares where - like most of Spain's colonial history in Africa - they were forgotten. But despite the recent publication of some of these letters, their stories remain poorly known, and this long-forgotten archive has not yet revealed all of its secrets.

25/12/2023 21:02:00	Israel-Gaza war: Netanyahu vows to intensify campaign - BBC News	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will intensify its fight against Hamas in the coming days.He told members of his party that he had visited Gaza on Monday morning and that Israel's military campaign there was "not close to being over".His comments come days after the US secretary of state said Israel should lower the intensity of its strikes.The war began on 7 October after Hamas led a deadly attack on communities inside Israel.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said on Monday that some 20,674 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli bombardments since then. It says most of the fatalities have been women and children.Some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed when Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on 7 October. About 240 people were taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel says 132 are still being held.Mr Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas and return the hostages to Israel.He told a meeting of his Likud party that troops he met on his visit to Gaza had urged Israel to keep fighting "until the end". "We're not stopping. We're continuing to fight, and we're intensifying the fighting in the coming days. It's going to be a long war that's not close to ending."Later on Monday, the prime minister was heckled by relatives of hostages demanding the immediate release of their loved ones during an address to parliament."We will not be able to release all the abductees without military pressure ... we will not stop fighting," he said, as families chanted "Now! Now!" from the gallery.Israeli and Arab media say that Egypt has proposed a plan for a ceasefire between the two sides.According to reports, the plan would see the phased release of all Israeli hostages and an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails over the course of a month and a half, ending with a suspension of Israel's offensive.A previous temporary truce deal negotiated by Qatar saw dozens of hostages released from Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.So far, both Israel and Hamas have resisted growing calls for a ceasefire.On Sunday the Gazan health ministry said an Israeli air strike killed at least 70 people in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in the centre of the strip, with a densely populated residential block destroyed.The Palestine Red Crescent Society said "intense" Israeli air strikes led to the closure of main roads between Maghazi and two other refugee camps, Al-Bureij and Al-Nuseirat, "hindering the work of ambulances and rescue teams".In a statement to the BBC on Sunday, the Israeli military said it had received "reports of an incident in the Maghazi camp"."Despite the challenges posed by Hamas terrorists operating within civilian areas in Gaza, the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] is committed to international law including taking feasible steps to minimize harm to civilians," it added.	
25/12/2023 17:36:00	Israeli strike in Syria kills Iranian commander, Iran says - BBC News	A senior Iranian commander was killed in a suspected Israeli strike in Syria. Iranian media say. Seyyed Razi Mousavi was "an experienced military adviser" to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the semi-official Tasnim news agency said. It says he was killed in an air strike on the Sayyida Zeinab area south-east of Damascus.Israel has carried out military strikes in Syria for years, against what it says are Iran-linked targets.The strikes have increased in frequency over the past months following Hamas' attack on 7 October. Iranian forces have been present in Syria since the early stages of the Syrian civil war, where they helped support the regime of President Bashar al-Assad against widespread rebellion to his rule.Mousavi is said to have been an aide to IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani, who was killed by the US in 2020.  He was one of most senior IRGC operatives in Syria, according to Tasnim, and helped co-ordinate the relationship between Tehran and Damascus. Iran's Revolutionary Guards said that Israel would "pay for this crime". There has been no immediate comment from Israel's military, which rarely discusses cross-border strikes. Earlier this month, Iran accused Israel of killing two members of the Revolutionary Guards in Syria.	
25/12/2023 06:45:00	Israel Gaza war: Hamas says 70 killed in Israeli air strike on camp - BBC News	Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says an Israeli air strike killed at least 70 people in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in the centre of the strip.A spokesman said the death toll was likely to rise given the large number of families living in the area.The Israeli military told the BBC it was looking into reports of the strike.It comes as Israeli and Arab media say Egypt, which borders the Gaza Strip, has put forward a new proposal for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.Dozens of injured people were rushed from Maghazi to nearby Al-Aqsa Hospital with footage showing some children's faces covered in blood and body bags piled outside.The health ministry says three houses were hit in the attack late on Sunday.According to ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra, a densely populated residential block was destroyed.A father said he had lost his daughter and grandchildren, adding that his family had fled from the north for safety in central Gaza."They lived on the third floor of one of the buildings," he said. "The wall collapsed on them. My grandchildren, my daughter, her husband - all gone."We are all targeted. Civilians are targeted. There is no safe place. They told us to leave Gaza City - now we came to central Gaza to die."The Palestine Red Crescent Society says "intense" Israeli air strikes have led to the closure of main roads between Maghazi and two other refugee camps, Al-Bureij and Al-Nuseirat, "hindering the work of ambulances and rescue teams".In a statement to the BBC, the Israeli military said it had received "reports of an incident in the Maghazi camp"."Despite the challenges posed by Hamas terrorists operating within civilian areas in Gaza, the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] is committed to international law including taking feasible steps to minimize harm to civilians," it added.According to the health ministry, more than 20,000 people have been killed - mostly children and women - and 54,000 injured in Gaza since 7 October, when Hamas and other Palestinian groups attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. Earlier on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war had come at a "very heavy price" for his country.The Israeli military said more than a dozen soldiers had been killed in Gaza since Friday, bringing the total for the ground offensive launched after 7 October to 156.Saturday was one of its deadliest days but Mr Netanyahu said there was "no choice" but to keep fighting.The new ceasefire proposal by Egypt would be implemented in three parts: Indirect negotiations would be held in Egypt with Qatari and US participation. An Israeli source told Maariv newspaper that the Egyptian initiative could lead to negotiations. Hamas says it is studying the proposal.Meanwhile, the Danish shipping giant, Maersk, says it is preparing to resume shipping operations through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The announcement came after an international military operation, led by the US, was deployed to prevent the targeting of commercial ships by drones from areas of Yemen controlled by Houthi rebels. The Houthis have declared their support for Hamas and have said they would target any ship travelling to Israel.Maersk and other shipping companies stopped sending ships through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal earlier this month as a result of drone attacks. US Central Command said two days ago that a US navy destroyer had shot down four drones in the Red Sea launched from Yemeni territory.  In another development, Pope Francis appealed for peace in the Middle East as he presided over a Christmas Eve Mass at Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. Referring to the war between Israel and Hamas, the Pope said Jesus's message of peace was being drowned out by the "futile logic of war" in the very land where he had been born.

24/12/2023 21:23:00	Israel-Gaza war: Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel paying 'heavy price' - BBC News	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the Gaza war has come at a "very heavy price" for his side.The military says more than a dozen soldiers have been killed in the territory since Friday, bringing the total of the ground assault to 154.Saturday was one of its deadliest days - but the Israeli PM there was "no choice" but to keep fighting.Meanwhile, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 70 people were killed in a strike on a refugee camp on Sunday.More than 20,000 people have been killed - mostly women and children, and 54,000 injured in Gaza since 7 October, the ministry says. Remarking on the latest Israeli troop deaths, Mr Netanyahu said: "This is a difficult morning, after a very difficult day of fighting in Gaza."But he said his forces would continue with "full force until the end", reiterating his goals of eliminating Hamas and ensuring the safe return of hostages held in Gaza."Let it be clear: this will be a long war," the Israeli prime minister added.The military's 154th death was announced later that day: tank commander Maj Aryeh Rein.In a separate statement, the military said it had killed more than 8,000 Palestinian fighters during its campaign to date - in remarks quoted by the Reuters news agency. The Israeli operation began after Hamas fighters crossed from Gaza into southern Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.Israel insists that it takes steps to avoid civilian casualties, and blames Hamas for embedding itself in densely-populated areas.US President Joe Biden - a key ally of Mr Netanyahu - emphasised the "critical need" to protect civilian lives during a call with the Israeli prime minister on Saturday, the White House said.Mr Biden told reporters that he had not asked for a ceasefire in the call. Both men believe such a move would benefit Hamas.On Friday, the UN Security Council approved a resolution demanding large-scale aid deliveries to Gaza - but this, too, stopped short of calling for a ceasefire between the two warring sides. Talks held in Egypt earlier this week designed to secure a fresh truce between Israel and Hamas have so far failed to deliver results. A Palestinian official familiar with the ceasefire negotiations told the BBC that Egypt presented a new three-stage plan that would begin with a two-week humanitarian truce - which could be extended - during which Hamas would release 40 hostages and Israel would release 120 Palestinian prisoners. This stage would be followed by the formation of an independent body to deal with humanitarian relief and reconstruction, as well as a comprehensive ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners.The Israeli military has kept up its bombing campaign in Gaza - ordering civilians to flee. The UN said the latest evacuation order affected 150,000 people in the middle of the territory.On Saturday, Israel said 700 Palestinian militants had been arrested during its ground offensive to date.It also said one of its fighter jets had killed Hassah Atrash, a man it accused of smuggling weapons into Gaza to arm Hamas. There has been no confirmation from Hamas. The Israeli military has said it has almost full operational control of the north of the Gaza Strip, and is stepping up operations elsewhere. A spokesman has said troops are entering new Hamas strongholds in southern areas.Briefing his cabinet on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu denied suggestions the US president had persuaded him against further expanding his military operation.The Wall Street Journal had reported that Mr Netanyahu had been talked out of attacking Hamas's ally in Lebanon, the Hezbollah group.A government spokesperson told the BBC "the situation in the north... is intolerable" and that Israel was "trying to deter Hezbollah from dragging us into a war"."We will continue making the necessary preparations to repel this threat from the northern border," he added.	
24/12/2023 14:04:00	'Bethlehem is empty of joy - no Santa, no celebration' - BBC News	The atmosphere in Bethlehem is heavy with absence.Christmas celebrations have been cancelled this year and the thousands of tourists and pilgrims who would normally fill Manger Square are nowhere to be found. "The city is empty from happiness, from joy, from kids, from Santa. There is no celebration this year," says Madeleine, a resident of Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank. The famous Christmas tree, usually in the middle of the square, is not there. There are no carols or Christmas market stands.Instead, a nativity scene, which shows a newborn Jesus surrounded by big rocks and barbed wire, has been installed as a tribute to the children of Gaza. In an unusually empty Nativity Church, Father Eissa Thaldjiya tells me his city feels like a shadow of itself. "I've been a priest in this church for 12 years. I was born in Bethlehem, and I've never seen it like this - even during the Covid-19 pandemic," he says."We have brothers and sisters in Gaza - this is what makes it difficult to celebrate… But it's good to be united in prayers." Jawdat Mikhael lives in Bethlehem, but his family is trapped in Northern Gaza. His parents, brother and dozens of other relatives have been sheltering in the Holy Family Church near Shejaiya in the east of Gaza City - an area devastated by Israeli bombardment. As Jawdat and I are talking, a call from his father Han'na Mikhael comes through. The line is crackly and connection is unstable - yet he hangs on for a glimpse of his dad. Han'na tells his son the family is doing ok. He says he's managed to venture out of the church for the first time in more than two weeks to try to find some food. He says that all is left around the church is rubble and that all the shops are burned. "It's total destruction," he says.He wells up as he says that communications are down and that there is no water. Food is scarce, too - "enough to keep you alive - not to fill your stomach," he says.Han'na cries as he tells me about how different Christmas was last year. "On days like this, we'd be decorating the church. There'd be carols. People would come over to help. But now we're just praying to make it out of here alive."  The family has already suffered a terrible loss.  A week ago, Jawdat's grandmother, Naheda Khalil Anton - who was also sheltering in the church in Gaza - was shot twice in the stomach as she was on her way to the bathroom. His aunt Samar Kamal Anton rushed to help her and was shot in the head. Jawdat shows me pictures of the immediate aftermath and the funeral.His family had been sheltering in the Holy Family Church since the beginning of the war. Now, they've buried their loved ones there.   The family blames Israeli snipers for their death. The IDF says it will continue its investigation.  Through tears, Han'na says that his two family members died before his eyes: "It was a shock... It was unbearable."He apologises to me for crying, and for not being able to speak much: "I'm sorry, but it's just so difficult. We've endured so much."  A big bang is heard as we are talking, then a second sounds out before Jawdat reluctantly says goodbye to his dad.This morning in Bethlehem, church bells have been ringing as some locals gathered around the Jesus in the rubble installation and Arabic songs played out on the speakers, one calling for salam - peace - for children.  Dozens of people are in the middle holding a big Palestinian flag - waving it up and down. The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, is in Bethlehem for his traditional address. He was wearing the traditional black and white chequered Palestinian scarf. Before he entered the Church of Nativity, he said this was "a very sad Christmas".  "We are in a war, a terrible war. Our thoughts go first and foremost to Gaza, to our people in Gaza... Two million are suffering," he said.He added that "a ceasefire is not enough". "We have to stop these hostilities and turn the page because violence generates only violence." A few steps away from Manger Square, souvenir shops line Star Street on both sides but without the usual bustle of buying, selling and haggling. The famous Palestinian stitch scarves, cushion covers and artefacts hang outside shops, untouched. This is normally high season for the market. Not this year. "We cannot celebrate with a lot of people killed in Gaza," says Abood Subouh, a shop owner in the local market just off Manger Square. He tells me that, sad as it is to see his city and his business this way, celebrating Christmas feels wrong this year: "We can't be happy because we are not on the other side of the world. We are still in Palestine."

There were no casualties.Iran has not commented. Houthi rebels in Yemen - who are backed by Iran and support Hamas in its war with Israel - have recently used drones and rockets to target vessels in the Red Sea.But this event is the first of its kind so far away from there, according to maritime security firm Ambrey. The same company also said the vessel was heading from Saudi Arabia to India, and was linked to Israel. The Houthis have claimed to be targeting Israel-linked vessels over the conflict in Gaza.The US said the Chem Pluto was hit by "a one-way attack drone fired from Iran". It is believed to be the first time the US has publicly accused Iran of targeting a ship directly. It has previously accused Iran of being "deeply involved" in planning operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea - a charge Tehran has denied. However, Iran's Revolutionary Guards have warned they could force the closure of waterways other than the Red Sea if "America and its allies continue committing crimes" in Gaza.The Pentagon statement said the Chem Pluto, "a Liberia-flagged, Japanese-owned, and Netherlands-operated chemical tanker", was struck on Saturday at 10:00 local time (06:00 GMT). The hit caused structural damage.The incident took place 200 nautical miles (370km) south-west of the city of Veraval in India's Gujarat state, according to United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO).Ambrey said the event fell within an area considered a "heightened threat area" for Iranian drones.The Indian navy sent an aircraft and warships to offer assistance. The BBC was not able to independently verify the incident.In a separate development, the US Central Command (Centcom) said that on Saturday "two Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles were fired into international shipping lanes in the Southern Red Sea from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. No ships reported being impacted".It also said the USS Laboon warship patrolling the area "shot down four unmanned aerial drones originating from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen that were inbound" to the American vessel.Later that day, a crude oil tanker reported being hit by a Houthi drone in the southern Red Sea, while another tanker saw a near miss.Many global shipping groups have suspended operations in the Red Sea due to the increased risk of attacks. The UK government has vowed to ensure the route's safety. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps told the Sunday Times newspaper that the UK was committed to repelling attacks on vessels - and would not allow the Red Sea to become a "no-go area".Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary David Cameron described Iran as a "thoroughly malign influence in the region and in the world".He said the Iranian leadership and its proxies needed to be sent an "incredibly clear message that this escalation will not be tolerated".Chris Farrell from Neptune P2P Group, a UK maritime security company, described nervousness in the region and observed that container ships were proving more likely to reroute than larger vessels."Nobody really knows the situation out there," he told the BBC World Service's Weekend programme. "Because of the lack of stability, that's creating the uncertainty with the clients and the shipping companies which are putting their assets within that region."	
24/12/2023 02:19:00	Israel-Gaza: Israel says it has arrested hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad members - BBC News	Israel says it has arrested 200 members of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups in the past week and taken them into its territory for questioning.A statement said some of the suspects had been hiding among the civilian population and surrendered voluntarily.Israel says 700 Palestinian militants have been arrested since it launched its military operation and invasion of Gaza with the aim of eliminating Hamas. Hamas says mostly women and children are being killed by the Israelis.The BBC is unable to verify the claims. Israel has previously stressed that it takes steps to avoid civilian casualties, and blames Hamas for embedding itself in densely-populated areas.Israel launched its retaliatory operation after Hamas fighters crossed from Gaza into southern Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.More than 20,000 people have been killed and 53,000 injured in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Its update on Saturday said another 201 people had been killed and 368 others injured in the previous day alone.  The UN earlier announced that its aid worker Issam al-Mughrabi, 56, had been killed in a strike - along with his wife, children and more than 70 members of his extended family.Israel announced that five more of its soldiers had been killed in fighting in Gaza, bringing the total to 144 to since it launched its ground operation. The military has kept up its bombing campaign in Gaza - ordering civilians to flee. On Saturday, it said one of its fighter jets had killed Hassah Atrash, a man it accused of smuggling weapons into Gaza to arm Hamas. There was no confirmation from Hamas.In a separate development on Saturday, US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed in a phone call Israel's ongoing military operation in Gaza. Mr Biden "emphasised the critical need to protect the civilian population including those supporting the humanitarian aid operation, and the importance of allowing civilians to move safely away from areas of ongoing fighting", the White House said.Meanwhile, Mr Netanyahu "made it clear that Israel would continue the war until all of its goals have been achieved", the Israeli PM's office said.The Israeli military has said it has almost full operational control of the north of the Gaza Strip, and is stepping up operations in the south.The UN said the latest evacuation order affected 150,000 people in the middle of the territory."People in Gaza are people," commented Thomas White from UNWRA, the agency for Palestinian refugees. "They are not pieces on a checkerboard - many have already been displaced several times."The latest evacuation order impacted people in the Bureij refugee camp, who were told to head towards Deir al-Balah city further south. Palestinian news agency Wafa reported on Saturday that Bureij had been shelled - as had the Jabalia and Nuseirat camps, among other locations.A medic named Ziad told Reuters news agency he was left asking where to go, as there was "no safe place".An adviser to the Israeli prime minister has acknowledged "terrible suffering" in Gaza - but told the BBC this was because the territory's Hamas leadership "don't give a hoot" for the people there. The suffering "shouldn't have happened" but came about after a "declaration of war" by Hamas on 7 October, said Mark Regev.The questioning of 200 new suspects was announced in a joint statement on Saturday by the Israeli military and internal security service Shin Bet.The statement said this followed the arrests in Gaza of "hundreds of suspects involved in terrorist activities".The BBC is not able to independently verify all battlefield claims. However, it did verify video earlier this month showing the detention of dozens of Palestinian men in the north Gaza Strip.	
24/12/2023 00:46:00	Awni Eldous: The Palestinian boy who found YouTube fame after death - BBC News	After Awni Eldous died, his dreams came true.In a video posted in August 2022, he holds a microphone and smiles as he declares his ambitions for his YouTube gaming channel."So now folks, let me introduce myself: I am a Palestinian from Gaza, aged 12 years old. The aim of this channel is to reach 100,000 subscribers, or 500,000, or one million," he says.He ends the short video saying "peace out" to his 1,000 subscribers before walking out of view.Just over a year later, Awni became one of the first Palestinian children to be killed in the war. Relatives say Awni's family home was hit in an Israeli strike on 7 October, just hours after Hamas gunmen stormed across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 240 hostage.Awni's video now has millions of views - and other videos in which he voicelessly plays computer games have millions more. Nearly 1.5 million people have subscribed to his YouTube channel.To his aunt, Ala'a, he was a happy, confident and helpful boy who would hold the door open for her. Another family member called him "engineer Awni" because of his love of computers. To others, this 13-year-old gamer has become a kind of symbol, representing the loss of children in the Gaza Strip. "Please forgive us," reads one comment on his video. "I wish we knew you before you died."The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 20,000 people have been killed there since the war began - more than a third of them children. The UN children's agency (Unicef) has described it as the "most dangerous place in the world to be a child".The day of the Hamas attack, as Israel began to retaliate, Ala'a imagined a bomb destroying her family's home in Gaza City. That night, around 20:20, her phone lit up with messages from friends: Awni's family home had been hit.A different branch of the family lived on each floor of the three-storey building in the Zeitoun neighbourhood. Awni lived on a floor with his mum and dad, his two older sisters, and two younger brothers.The strike was also documented in October by human rights group Amnesty International. "Two bombs fell suddenly on top of the building and destroyed it. My wife and I were lucky to survive because we were staying on the top floor," Awni's uncle Mohammed said. Both he and a neighbour said they had received no warning. "It was sudden, boom," the neighbour said.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not comment on this specific strike but said it was striking military targets and that Hamas had a "documented practice of operating from nearby, underneath and within densely populated areas".It said: "The IDF's strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law, including the taking of feasible precautions and after an assessment that the expected incidental damage to civilians and civilian property is not excessive in relation to the expected military advantage from the attack."It added that the IDF "regrets any harm caused to civilians or civilian property as a result of its operations, and examines all its operations in order to learn and improve and ensure all activity was in accordance with operational procedures and the law".Ala'a didn't want to believe the messages she was receiving. But after connecting to the wi-fi, she saw that a close friend of the family had shared a photo of her brother on social media with the caption: "Rest in peace." She ran to the hospital."They asked me to see the bodies but my husband refused… he wanted me to remember their beautiful faces when they were alive," she says in a Facebook message, sent from the south of Gaza, where she is now displaced.Ala'a says 15 members of her family were killed that night, among them Awni. She describes him as being a calm, helpful boy. His dad was a computer engineer and Ala'a says that for as long as she can remember, Awni would copy his father, pulling laptops apart and then trying to piece them back together. In photos Awni shared on his own Facebook page, he stands in front of a blackboard holding up a computer motherboard to fellow students, as he leads a technology lesson organised as part of a "little teachers" scheme. Pictures published on his school's Facebook page show him winning numerous awards.Shortly after his death, one of his teachers shared a photo with Awni, describing the boy's "ever-lasting smile".Outside of school, Ala'a says Awni loved spending time with his family. On one "very wonderful night", Ala'a says she watched a film with Awni and his siblings, sharing crisps and chocolates.The last time she saw him was at a family breakfast three weeks before his death, where she looked at her nephew and said: "Awni is becoming a man."Mostly, Awni loved computers and gaming, and he idolised the YouTubers who made careers out of his hobby."He wanted to be like them - to have followers and fans," Ala'a says.Awni started his channel in June 2020. His videos show him playing Pro Evolution Soccer, the car racing game Blur and the first-person shooting game Counter-Strike.Long captions give details of the games, the companies that made them and the dates of their release.In a video of Awni with an uncle, the pair promise a "special" range of content on the channel, declaring in unison: "It will be a blast."They grin and gesticulate as they take it in turns to talk. They say they plan to expand the channel to include vlogs and interviews. Ashraf Eldous, a distant relative of Awni who works as a programmer and helps run several YouTube channels, says the teenager would frequently contact him asking for advice.In messages from August 2022, shared with the BBC, Awni addresses "brother Ashraf" as he asks for YouTube tips. He would even take his father's phone in secret to ask for advice, Ashraf recalls.Ashraf says the last time he spoke to Awni's father, he was told: "Take care of Awni. Answer his questions. He's ambitious.""His ambition was to be my competitor or colleague," Ashraf says. "He created a YouTube channel. It wasn't that big, it didn't have any big views. Every start-up is hard at the beginning."But after Awni's death in October, the views mounted when his fledgling channel caught the attention of established YouTubers, including Kuwaiti gamer AboFlah.In an emotional video now viewed almost nine million times, AboFlah cries and walks away from the camera.He has just discovered messages Awni had sent him on social media.One of those message says: "Nothing compares to Palestine's winter in Gaza; the atmosphere is legendary. We're drinking sahlab [a sweetened milk drink]. It's so good. We're also eating roasted chestnuts. I hope you come to Palestine. Much love."In another, Awni writes to AboFlah: "You're a legend and a role model."In the video, as AboFlah weeps, he says: "It's such a shame for this child to die… This child is one of many others who are even younger than him. If God wills it, they'll be birds of paradise.""What you see is from the heart. I could not stop my tears," AboFlah tells the BBC, reflecting on the video he uploaded in October."It was very touching to hear that he looked up to me as a role model."Asked why he thinks Awni has made such a big impact, AboFlah says: "Fans see themselves in Awni. We are all Awni."The teenager's entire family - his four brothers and sisters and mother and father - were killed alongside him. But his surviving relatives say they are proud of the fame he has found after death."It's a gift from God that so many people around the world love Awni," says Ala'a."He used to talk about it enthusiastically, about his channel. He is more happy in heaven now."Additional reporting by Muath Al Khatib	
23/12/2023 02:16:00	Stakes are immense as Biden presses Israel to change course - BBC News	The US has a new diplomatic objective in the Gaza War - to convince Israel to scale back its military operations in coming weeks. This is a crucial test of the Biden administration, and whether it succeeds could help determine the next phase of the war - as well as the president's own political fortunes back home.In public, the American effort to shape and restrain Israel's war has taken the form of advice rather than pressure. US officials - from Mr Biden to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin - have continually affirmed what they present as Israel's right to self-defence, and declared that a military operation which stops short of removing Hamas from power would only guarantee more attacks. As the conflict wore on, they've also become more outspoken about the need to protect civilians, warning that not doing so would land Israel with a "strategic defeat". Much of the world sees this approach as failing to temper a relentless bombing campaign that ranks among the most deadly and destructive this century.US officials insist their strategy has been the most effective way for the administration to influence an Israel traumatised by the unprecedented Hamas attack and disinclined to hold back.Yet American policy since that day has fractured Joe Biden's Democratic Party, lost him crucial support among young and Arab Americans and left the US looking isolated on the world stage.So far, President Biden's approach has achieved tangible, if limited, results.Persistent and painstaking diplomacy cleared a path to allowing some humanitarian aid into Gaza early on in the war, and helped broker a seven-day ceasefire to encourage hostage releases and the delivery of more assistance to desperate civilians.The Americans have certainly been very hands on. A steady stream of senior officials to the region has meant there's been someone in the room much of the time, having the difficult conversations face to face."These trips are important because we have constant issues that we're dealing with together with the Israelis," said a US official.  Each of Mr Blinken's three visits to the region has been a whirlwind of activity and he's been keen to highlight continued American efforts to free the hostages, increase humanitarian aid and ensure the conflict does not expand to consume the entire Middle East.Progress on protecting civilians has been hard to see. This week the death toll in Gaza reached 20,000, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The Hamas raid on southern Israel on 7 October killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw about 240 taken hostage.Despite winning assurances that Israel would take steps to do so, Mr Blinken has spoken about the "gap" between the intent and the results.So January will be a crucial test of whether the administration can convince Israel to alter the dynamic of the war. It's pushing the Israelis to "de-intensify" military operations in Gaza and transition to more targeted tactics that produce fewer civilian casualties than the bombing-and artillery-driven campaign.It is a request that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly endorsed, although his defence minister has talked about the war moving into different phases.Critics of the American strategy say the US has been so cautious that it is effectively complicit in Israel's war. They say it should have more forcefully called for Israel to curtail a disproportionate military campaign and used the threat to withhold or set conditions on massive amounts of American military aid to rein in Israeli excess.But Aaron David Miller, who worked as a Middle East adviser in the State Department for some 25 years, calls the notion that the US could pressure Israel to change its policy in this case "magical thinking.""The battlefield dynamic is beyond our capacity to control, let alone micromanage," he says, noting that Israel and Hamas are pursuing irreconcilable goals.Mr Miller, who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, says history shows that Israel has responded to rare occasions of US pressure only when American demands are tethered to a result they can accept. "Pressing the Israelis on a matter of critical importance to them without offering a compelling alternative or an outcome that they can rationalise and justify, never works," he says.It's unclear if the "bear hug" strategy of publicly supporting Israel while preaching restraint behind closed doors will be enough to pull the Israelis across the line when it comes to scaling back the military campaign.In the meantime the Americans are contending with growing international isolation.Nowhere is this more evident than at the United Nations, where the US has opposed overwhelming demands for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.This week, with the UN warning of famine in Gaza, the US allowed the passage of a second Security Council resolution calling for more humanitarian access to Gaza. It did so after negotiating intensely to change language on the suspension of hostilities and mechanisms to monitor and speed up aid delivery.The administration wants no suggestion of a ceasefire that would constrain Israel's ability to destroy Hamas's leadership and military capability.But even some allies have been outspoken about this approach."The United States is losing respect, it's losing credibility as a powerful nation," former Irish President Mary Robinson, speaking on behalf of a group of global leaders known as The Elders, said in a recent interview on RTE News. "The United States has called for restraint, but [the Israeli government] isn't listening."And Arab partners of the US are alarmed by the radicalising effect of Israel's destruction in Gaza."Israel is jeopardising the standing of the United States and other Western friends of ours in our region," said Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi on a recent trip to Washington."It is not just killing Palestinians... it is also creating an environment in the region where the amount of hatred that's growing by the day, as a result of what we see unfolding in Gaza, is undoing 30 years of work that we all have invested in to normalise the idea of peace."Mr Blinken has stressed that the regional and international community should also be pressing Hamas to lay down its arms and stop "hiding behind civilians".But in comments at a fundraising event last week, President Biden appeared to acknowledge some of the administration's internal frustrations."(Israel) has most of the world supporting it," the president said. "But they're starting to lose that support by the indiscriminate bombing that takes place."Mr Biden is also facing growing domestic pressure to take a stronger line against Israel. In a New York Times public opinion survey this week, only 33% of registered American voters approved of the president's handling of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. A plurality, 44% to 39%, said Israel should end its military campaign. Heading into the 2024 presidential election year, the poll suggests the Biden administration is haemorrhaging support from key members of its electoral coalition. Among voters under 30, 46% said they sympathise more with the Palestinian side. Only 27% sided with the Israelis.Some prominent liberal members of the Democratic Party have pushed a resolution calling for a human rights report on Israel's use of American weapons that could potentially suspend US security assistance. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a left-wing independent who's an important ally of Joe Biden's, is sponsoring the resolution and has called Israeli conduct during the war "reckless and immoral".Separately, a group of House Democrats with national security backgrounds has written to the White House arguing that Mr Netanyahu's military strategy is not in the interests of either Israel or the US.And there've been various expressions of dissent from within Mr Biden's own administration. More than 800 staff members have supported a letter calling for an immediate ceasefire, although most have done so anonymously, and only one has resigned."I felt a lot of dissonance between coming into work every single day and serving this administration that I had previously so proudly done, and then feeling this sort of vacuum where the influence of a call to a ceasefire (would be) massive coming from the US president and our boss," one staffer told the BBC.Such sentiment underscores the difficult bind the US president finds himself in. Many world leaders, a significant number of administration insiders and about half the American public are increasingly unhappy with the current US strategy.But if the president starts to get tougher with the Israelis, the other half of Americans that back Israel would almost certainly object - and there's still no guarantee that his current critics would be satisfied.Scaling down the Israeli offensive is key. If it doesn't happen fast enough Mr Biden will have to seriously consider his next step.Especially as the calendar will soon flip to 2024 - the last year of his first presidential term. Domestic politics, always a factor in US foreign policy, will increasingly become a pressing concern for the president.For a man who promised a steady hand at the tiller after four years of Donald Trump's sometimes tumultuous foreign policy, the Gaza War has proven to be a formidable - and potentially grave - challenge to his political fortunes. 	
22/12/2023 22:09:00	Gadi Haggai: White House says US-Israeli hostage dead in Gaza - BBC News	A dual US-Israeli citizen believed to have been abducted by Hamas was killed during the 7 October raid in Israel, the White House said on Friday. Gadi Haggai, 73, was reportedly taken alongside his wife Judi near Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel on 7 October. It is believed his remains are being held by Hamas in Gaza. It is unclear exactly how or where he died.Five to 10 US citizens are still being held hostage, according to the Hostage and Missing Persons Families Forum. President Joe Biden said in a statement that he was "heartbroken by the news that American Gad Haggai is now believed to have been killed by Hamas on October 7".He said he grieves for the Haggai family, and called their suffering "intolerable"."I reaffirm the pledge we have made to all the families of those still held hostage: we will not stop working to bring them home," the president added.Mr Haggai, a retired chef and musician, was walking with his wife near Nir Oz on 7 October when the initial Hamas attack on southern Israel took place. He was described as a "man full of humour who knew how to make those around him laugh", as well as a gifted flautist and "musician at heart" by Liat Bell Sommer, a spokesperson for the Hostage and Missing Persons Families Forum - a group established by the families of those abducted by Hamas.During the attack, his wife alerted friends and family members that they had both been wounded. There has been no contact with the couple since. "She said they were shot by terrorists on a motorcycle and that my dad was wounded really bad," the couple's daughter Iris Weinstein Haggai was quoted as saying by the Times of Israel. "Paramedics tried to send her an ambulance. The ambulance got hit by a rocket." Approximately 240 hostages were taken during the Hamas raid on Israel on 7 October, which left 1,200 people dead. According to Israeli government statistics cited by Reuters, 129 people remain in Gaza, including 22 who are dead. The rest of the hostages were repatriated during a brief November truce or have been recovered during Israeli military operations. The forum believes that between five and 10 of the remaining hostages hold US citizenship. Earlier this week, the White House said it believes eight Americans are still in Hamas captivity. In a White House briefing earlier this week, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the US is in "serious talks and negotiations" over another humanitarian pause and hostage exchange.Hamas, for its part, has ruled out any more hostage releases until Israel agrees to a "full cessation of aggression". 	
22/12/2023 21:26:00	UN Security Council backs ramping up Gaza aid, but no ceasefire - BBC News	The UN Security Council (UNSC) has adopted a resolution urging more aid for the Gaza Strip, but falling short of a call for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.The vote followed days of negotiations to avoid a veto by the US, a permanent UNSC member and a key ally of Israel.UN chief António Guterres said the "real problem" to delivering aid was Israel's ongoing offensive.The UN has warned Gaza is at risk of famine if the war continues.Israel has launched a massive military campaign aimed at eliminating Hamas, following the 7 October attack in which militants killed at least 1,200 in southern Israel and took more than 240 hostage.At least 20,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Friday's resolution was introduced by the United Arab Emirates. Minutes before the vote, Russia - one of the five permanent members of the council - introduced an amendment to revert to an earlier draft calling for an immediate ceasefire. It argued the text gave Israel freedom of movement to further clear the Gaza Strip. The Russian amendment was defeated and both Russia and the US went on to abstain, while the other 13 members of the council backed the text that now calls for creating conditions "for a sustainable cessation of hostilities".The resolution said it aimed to introduce "extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip".It demanded that parties "allow, facilitate and enable the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale directly to the Palestinian civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip". The resolution calls for the appointment of coordinator to oversee a UN mechanism that will be set up with the goal of speeding up and streamlining the distribution of aid.Washington initially feared that would take away Israel's control of the screening process - but the resolution made clear it would be in consultation with all relevant parties.Reacting to the resolution, Hamas criticised what it said was an "insufficient step" to meet the humanitarian needs of people in Gaza, and accused the US of working hard to "empty this resolution of its essence".The resolution calls for "the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages" - and the Israel Defence Forces spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari urged the international community and international organisations to enforce it.While voting by the UN Security Council took place in New York, fighting continued to rage between Israel and Hamas. Israel has expanded its ground offensive in central Gaza after it issued an evacuation order to residents of Al-Bureij, telling them to move further south. Nearly 400 people died in Gaza in the last 48 hours, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.A quarter of households - roughly 500,000 people - are facing "catastrophic conditions", a UN food security agency found. It says the territory's entire population of roughly 2.2 million people is suffering acute food shortages."No-one in Gaza is safe from starvation," said Cindy McCain from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP).Trucks have been bringing aid into Gaza from Egypt for weeks, but the WFP recently estimated that just 10% of the food needed is currently getting into the territory. Talks have been taking place in Egypt to reach a new truce - similar to the week-long pause in fighting last month that saw 110 hostages released.But on Thursday they suffered a setback when Hamas said it would not agree to a release of some hostages in exchange for a partial ceasefire.It said Palestinian groups had rejected the prospect of more hostages being released until Israel agrees to end the war. Israel has repeatedly rejected a permanent ceasefire.After Friday's vote at the UNSC, the UK's Foreign Secretary David Cameron said "a sustainable ceasefire must mean that Hamas is no longer there, able to threaten Israel with rocket attacks and other forms of terrorism".	
22/12/2023 20:45:00	Plane grounded in France over human trafficking fears - BBC News	A plane carrying 303 Indian passengers has been grounded at an airport in north-eastern France on suspicion of human trafficking, French media report.The Airbus A340 was flying from the United Arab Emirates to the Nicaraguan capital, Managua.It was grounded during a technical stopover at the small Vatry airport in Marne department on Thursday after an "anonymous tip-off", prosecutors say.Several people are confined in the airport, which police have sealed off.An investigation has been launched into the conditions and purpose of the trip, local officials said.They added that some of the passengers were believed to be illegal migrants. Two passengers have been taken into custody.A statement by the Marne prefect's office said that the passengers were allowed to remain in the aircraft at first, but later the airport's arrival lounge was transformed into a waiting area with beds.The aircraft is owned by Romanian charter company Legend Airlines. A lawyer for the firm, Liliana Bakayoko, told French news channel BFMTV that it was ready to co-operate with the French authorities and hoped the plane could be on its way in the next couple of days.	
22/12/2023 17:42:00	Gaza facing famine if fighting continues, UN says - BBC News	The United Nations says Gaza is at risk of famine if the war between Israel and Hamas continues.A quarter of households - roughly 500,000 people - are facing "catastrophic conditions", a UN food security agency found. It says the territory's entire population of roughly 2.2m people is suffering acute food shortages."No-one in Gaza is safe from starvation," said Cindy McCain from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP)."Humanitarian access is needed now for supplies to flow into and throughout Gaza, and for civilians to safely receive life-saving aid". The report was published on Thursday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN body that assesses food security in places affected by conflict or natural disaster.It states that the "quantities of commodities, including food, allowed to enter the Gaza Strip are largely insufficient".On Friday, the UN's Security Council passed a resolution aiming to bring more aid into Gaza, but which stops short of calling for an immediate truce.Russia and the United States abstained on the vote, while the other 13 members of the council backed it. The resolution said it aimed to introduce "extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip" and called for "the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages". The resolution also requests that a "senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator" is appointed, with the responsibility for monitoring aid entering into the region.Trucks have been bringing aid into Gaza from Egypt for weeks, but the WFP recently estimated that just 10% of the food needed is currently getting into the territory. On Wednesday a convoy carrying aid from Jordan crossed into Gaza via Israel for the first time since the start of the war.Howaida Al-Daramali, a Palestinian woman who has been displaced to Khan Younis and who is also helping find shelter for other displaced families, said the limited aid being delivered "only goes to one or two places" and most people in Gaza were not receiving anything."We want this aid to be accompanied by teams who will be responsible for distributing it especially since the situation here is very difficult. Many people broke into the Red Crescent warehouses and looted them," she told the BBC.Meanwhile some families who were getting aid because they were in UN-run shelters were selling what they did not need at inflated prices, Ms al-Daramali said."Even with cash, there are no goods in the supermarket and no suppliers. We can buy only from people who receive aid and sell it at the school gates, which are dangerous places for us to reach," she said.People in Khan Younis were "psychologically and economically devastated", she said.The UN Security Council is meanwhile trying to agree on a vote calling for more aid to get into Gaza. The vote has been delayed for several days over the wording of the text. The US has expressed support for the latest draft resolution after earlier voicing "widespread concerns" with an earlier version that called for a ceasefire - something the US is against, saying it would only benefit Hamas. The new draft aims to create a mechanism to accelerate aid but makes clear it would involve relevant parties such as Israel. It also calls for all available routes to be used for deliveries but does not seek an immediate end to the fighting. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US Ambassador to the UN, described it as a "very strong resolution that is fully supported by the Arab group".Meanwhile, the fighting in and around Gaza continues. Hamas authorities on Thursday accused Israel of attacking the Rafah crossing - killing four people, including the director of the recently reopened Kerem Shalom crossing. Israel's military has not commented on the reported incident. Talks had been taking place in Egypt to reach a new truce - similar to the week-long pause in fighting last month that saw hostages released.But on Thursday they suffered a setback when Hamas said it would not agree to a release of some hostages in exchange for a partial ceasefire.It said Palestinian groups had rejected the prospect of more hostages being released until Israel agrees to end the war. Israel has repeatedly rejected a permanent ceasefire with Hamas, saying it aims to destroy the group.More than 240 Israeli hostages were captured on 7 October when Hamas broke through the fortified perimeter with Israel, killing 1,200 people. A total of 110 hostages were released in the truce last month.Earlier this week, Hamas said the number of people killed in Gaza in 10 weeks of fighting had passed 20,000.	
22/12/2023 12:54:00	Israel-Gaza: Pro-Palestinian demo held after badge row at school - BBC News	A school has closed early for Christmas due to a row with parents after a pupil wore a Palestinian badge to school.Parents held a protest on Thursday calling for the boy whose mother is from Gaza, to be allowed back to class at Barclay Primary school in Leyton.  He has been off for over a month after refusing the school's demand to remove the flag badge from his coat.The school has been asking parents to stop sending pupils to school wearing any signs of political allegiance.The school closed on Wednesday, two days before the end of term.The boy's father, Shahid, has told the BBC his eight-year-old son is traumatised by the incident. "He was not allowed to have play time, he was not allowed to have lunch with others in his year group," he said.Shahid went on to say his son was "sad, upset and angry" and has been questioning if he had "done something wrong".His mother, Rasha, has lost many family members, he explained.He said wearing a flag was his son's "way to show empathy for his dead relatives and friends in Gaza". Other parents have also claimed their children have been unable to show their support for Palestinians in school even on a non-school uniform day like Children in Need.The school has sent out several letters asking parents to stop sending their children to school wearing clothes, badges or scarves showing any political allegiance.  Two of the letters, seen by the BBC, mention a referral to the government's counter terrorism programme, Prevent, which has alarmed parents.The letters stated: "Extremist and divisive comments will be referred to Prevent team or Hate Crime Team in Waltham Forest."Prevent is a key part of the UK's counter-terrorism strategy. In practical terms, it places public bodies, including schools and the police, under a legal duty to identify people who may turn to extremism, and intervene in their lives before it is too late.If the local panels find someone who is at risk of becoming a terrorist, the Prevent teams use specialist mentors or other support programmes to turn around their lives.A mother outside the school gate said: "I was annoyed and angry they would threaten parents with Prevent."  Another mum, who has two children at the school, said that she was "shocked and stunned" to receive the letter. She added that she was "upset the school took that approach".In a statement on their website, the Lion Academy Trust which runs Barclay Primary school, which is rated "outstanding by Ofsted", strongly refutes all allegations. It says the "correspondence has been misappropriated and deliberately taken out of context".It also says that there was "no evidence to support any allegations of bullying or misconduct against the eight-year-old boy".The parents of the schoolboy have said they are seeking legal advice.Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

22/12/2023 00:00:00	UN Security Council demands Gaza aid deliveries at scale - BBC News		
22/12/2023 03:28:00	Israel-Gaza war: US backs UN Security Council vote on Gaza aid boost - BBC News	The UN Security Council is moving closer to a vote on humanitarian aid for Gaza after the US expressed support for the latest draft resolution. The vote, now delayed until Friday, had been in limbo after the US voiced "widespread concerns" with a draft. Washington had said it was concerned the resolution, put forward by the United Arab Emirates, could "actually slow down" aid into Gaza.The latest announcement from the US comes after some two weeks of talks.All week, the Security Council has repeatedly postponed the draft resolution aimed at bringing in some form of ceasefire, as wrangling continued over the language.The original draft called for a sustainable cessation of hostilities, but the final version calls for creating the conditions for one.It no longer calls for the use of all land, sea and air routes for deliveries - just all available routes. It still creates a mechanism to accelerate aid - but makes clear that's in consultation with relevant parties such as Israel. Emerging from a closed-door session on Thursday night, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield rejected claims the latest draft had been watered down, arguing it is "a very strong resolution". She called it "a resolution that we can support", but declined to say if the US would vote 'yes' or abstain. The key sticking point on Thursday appeared to be over the text's proposal to have a UN mechanism to monitor aid into Gaza - something the Arab group of nations insisted must be part of any meaningful resolution.But the US said that could take away Israel's control of the screening process - and it asked for another delay to allow time for discussions with Egypt on how such a monitoring mechanism could work for all parties.Currently, Israel monitors all aid and fuel deliveries to Gaza.Earlier this month, the majority of the Security Council - 13 of 15 members - supported a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, but the US vetoed it and the UK abstained. The US, like Israel, has objected that a ceasefire would benefit Hamas - and instead the US supports proposed pauses in fighting.But since then, pressure has been growing for fighting to be paused. Earlier this week, Hamas said the number of people killed in Gaza in 10 weeks of fighting had passed 20,000.On Thursday, the UN's World Food Programme warned that Gaza was at risk of famine if the war continued.WFP spokesperson Shaza Moghraby said: "We cannot wait for famine to be declared before we act. "We need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the opening of all border crossings and the resumption of commercial cargo to provide relief, put an end to the suffering and avert the very serious threat of famine."Talks had been taking place in Egypt to reach a new truce - similar to the week-long pause in fighting last month that saw hostages released.But on Thursday they suffered a setback when Hamas said it would not agree to a release of some hostages in exchange for a partial ceasefire.It said Palestinian groups had rejected the prospect of more hostages being released until Israel agrees to end the war. Israel has repeatedly rejected a permanent ceasefire with Hamas.More than 240 Israeli hostages were captured on 7 October when Hamas broke through the heavily guarded perimeter with Israel, killing 1,200 people. A total of 110 hostages were released in the truce last month.	
22/12/2023 01:20:00	False claims of staged deaths surge in Israel-Gaza war - BBC News	The mother and grandfather of five-month-old Palestinian baby Muhammad Hani al-Zahar held his dead body in front of a hospital following the resumption of hostilities in Gaza on the first day of December.But when footage of the grief-stricken family holding the body in their arms went viral on social media, many posts falsely claimed Muhammad was merely a doll, and not a real baby.These claims were amplified in an article by the Jerusalem Post, an influential Israeli newspaper, which showed an image of Muhammad in rigor mortis after his death and said it proved he was a doll. After a backlash, the paper removed the article from its website, saying on X (formerly Twitter) that the report "was based on faulty sourcing". A few weeks earlier, a video of Israeli siblings Rotem Mathias, 16, and his two sisters, Shakked and Shir, went viral online. Rotem witnessed his parents get killed by Hamas gunmen on 7 October as they sheltered in their house in a kibbutz near the border with Gaza.The viral video featured edited clips from the siblings' interviews with US outlets ABC and CNN days after the attack. It falsely claimed that they were "crisis actors" who were lying about their parents' deaths and struggling to hold their laughter in front of cameras.These are just two examples - viewed millions of times each - showcasing the social media schism in the Israel-Gaza war that has brought denial of atrocities and human suffering to the forefront of online debate about the conflict.One of the key terms used to deny or minimise human suffering in Gaza is "Pallywood", a disparaging combination of "Palestine" and "Hollywood". Its proponents claim fake or staged footage of Palestinian "crisis actors" posing as genuine civilian casualties is regularly shared online to influence public opinion and deceive global media.A BBC Verify analysis suggests that on X alone, the term "Pallywood" has seen the largest spike in the number of mentions in the past 10 years. During previous flare-ups of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in 2014, 2018 and 2021 the word "Pallywood" consistently peaked at either 9,500 or 13,000 mentions in a single month on X. After the 7 October Hamas attack, the number of mentions peaked at 220,000 in November.BBC Verify found that among those sharing the term "Pallywood" on social media in the past months, including X, Facebook and Instagram, were Israeli officials, celebrities and popular bloggers from Israel and the US.On the other hand, while supporters of the Palestinians do not have a single term used to deny atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October in Israel, posts making such claims routinely get millions of views on social media. Some falsely say that Hamas did not kill civilians on that day, or that the scale of civilian casualties has been massively exaggerated. Some even go further, falsely claiming that most of the victims were actually killed by the Israel Defense Forces, not Hamas.Experts specialising in reconciliation efforts worry that viral disinformation which denies the other side's suffering can be dehumanising, and may impact the longer-term prospects of mending the relations between the communities affected."The biggest risks, I think, are the erosion of trust and the erosion of empathy," said Harriet Vickers, programme lead at the Tim Parry and Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace, a charity that supports victims of conflict, political violence and acts of terror. "It undermines the ability to even begin approaching reconciliation efforts."She added that false narratives and dehumanising rhetoric can also "have a profound effect beyond those that are directly impacted by violence, and can actually further the hurt that is being done to those individuals".False narratives about "crisis actors" or atrocity denial are not new to those who study disinformation. The concept of "crisis actors" in particular - that is people who pretend or are paid to act out some particular tragedy or disaster - has been popular among promoters of conspiracy theories for years.It was notoriously used to allege that parents of dead children in the Sandy Hook school shooting in the US were somehow faking their personal tragedies. In the past few years similar viral claims were posted about the killing of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha, and victims of the war in Syria. But the volume of dehumanising rhetoric posted during this war has surprised even those who deal with such content on a daily basis.Eliot Higgins, the founder of the investigative website Bellingcat that has covered the wars in Syria and Ukraine in recent years, says the volume of disinformation in the current Israeli-Gaza war is "unique to this conflict"."I've seen the kind of same intensity of toxicity and vile responses and disinformation, the way they treat women and children and that kind of stuff, with Syria, with Ukraine and so many different topics - just there are more people doing it," he told the BBC.Mr Higgins added that because many people have had very strong opinions about either side of the conflict for years, "there are more people who are sharing stuff because it is resonating with them emotionally"."They don't really care if it's true or not, it just feels true to them." Back in November, a video showing makeup and fake blood being applied to a child actor's face was posted on X by Ofir Gendelman, the Israeli prime minister's spokesperson to the Arab world."See for yourselves how they fake injuries and evacuating 'injured' civilians, all in front of the cameras. Pallywood gets busted again," Mr Gendelman said in a post that was viewed millions of times before being deleted.The video was, in fact, behind-the-scenes footage from a 45-second Lebanese film made in tribute to Gazans and posted online in October. Director Mahmoud Ramzi, who took to Instagram to personally debunk the false claim made about his film, told the BBC that in the end, the misinformation might have backfired, with the controversy helping his film reach a much bigger audience.The BBC approached Mr Gendelman for comment but he has not responded.Others have expressed concern for the real people who find themselves in the middle of online disinformation wars. James Longman, the ABC correspondent who interviewed Rotem and his sisters, says watching Rotem recount the death of his parents brought him and his cameraman to tears."He was in tears, his sister was in tears, their grandfather, who was with us. Our cameraman, the hospital porters, the nurses, the doctors, and I was in tears. I mean all of us sitting there listening to what he had to say," he told the BBC. "It was extraordinary to hear him say it, to watch his reactions as he explained what had happened."Mr Longman said he was shocked when he saw false claims about the siblings being shared online and took to X to debunk it. His post was shared widely, and led to at least one of the viral messages about the siblings being subsequently deleted by the person who posted it."But it doesn't make it any less horrible for Rotem's family," Mr Longman said. 	
21/12/2023 23:28:00	Jamal Khashoggi: Wife of murdered journalist wins US political asylum - BBC News	The wife of Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist who was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, has been granted political asylum in the US.Mr Khashoggi died in October 2018, and US intelligence has said it believes Saudi Arabia was behind the killing.Hanan Elatr, Mr Khashoggi's wife, feared for her safety and came to the US in August 2020 to apply for asylum.The BBC reviewed documents showing she was granted indefinite asylum status on 28 November."We did win," Ms Elatr told the BBC, emotion catching in her throat. "Yes, they took Jamal's life and they destroyed my life, but we did win."It has been more than three years since Ms Elatr first applied for political asylum in the US. She has maintained that her life would be in danger if she returned to Egypt, where she is from, or the United Arab Emirates - her home of more than 25 years. The former Emirates flight attendant came to the US and lived afraid for her safety in Maryland for many months, abandoning her job and life, her attorney Randa Fahmy said in an interview.Eventually she was able to obtain a work permit in October 2021 to begin her new life in the US. Ms Elatr now has a job and apartment - though she struggles to make ends meet. "It's been a lengthy process," Ms Fahmy said. Despite the time it took, Ms Elatr expressed gratitude to President Joe Biden and his administration for "opening the door for me". She said she is "relieved from feeling scared".Ms Elatr finally interviewed with US immigration services in March in a process that her attorney described as "pretty traumatic" for the level of detail and repetition that it required. They expected to receive a response in 60 to 90 days, but Ms Fahmy believes that the application process was held up by ongoing negotiations between the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel.The two women enlisted the help of various members of Congress, but called congressman Don Beyer and Senator Tim Kaine their "champions on Capitol Hill". Both lawmakers told the BBC that they were happy to help Ms Elatr and were relieved to hear the news. Mr Beyer said it was "the clearest case for political asylum imaginable"."After all that she and her family have been through, it is good to see them granted this recognition and the measure of security that will come with it," Mr Beyer said in a statement. "I will continue to support Mrs Khashoggi as she seeks accountability for her husband's murder, a terrible injustice which I will not forget."Ms Elatr and her attorney said that obtaining political asylum will serve as a springboard "to take our case further to bring justice for Jamal". They are seeking compensation from Saudi Arabia for Mr Khashoggi's death and are working to obtain the journalist's electronic devices from the Turkish government. They also intend to pursue legal action against Israeli spyware firm NSO Group, which has faced widespread allegations that its Pegasus software has been sold to and used by authoritarian governments across the world.The BBC has reached out to NSO Group for comment, but it has previously denied wrongdoing. "We're determined to get justice for Jamal and peace and justice for Hanan," Ms Fahmy said. 	
21/12/2023 00:19:00	Israel Gaza: 'I walked my kids past explosions and rotting corpses' - BBC News	After weeks of Israeli bombing, on 16 November Jehad El-Mashhrawi and his young family fled their home in northern Gaza. The BBC Arabic cameraman shares a vivid and shocking account of what he, his wife and children experienced as they headed south.Warning: This story contains graphic descriptions which may be distressingWe left in such a hurry. We were in the middle of baking some bread and realised the houses opposite us were being bombed, one by one. I knew it would soon be our turn. We had packed some bags in case this happened but everything was so rushed we forgot to take them. We didn't even shut the front door.We had waited to leave because we didn't want to move my elderly parents and we had taken years to save up to build our house in al-Zeitoun, but in the end we had to go. My baby son, Omar, died there in November 2012, killed when shrapnel hit our house in another war with Israel and I couldn't risk losing any more children.I knew that in the south there was no electricity, no water and people had to queue for hours to use a toilet. But in the end, grabbing just a bottle of water and some leftover bread, we joined thousands of others making the dangerous journey down the Salah al-Din road to the south, where Israel said it was safe.Lots of my family walked together - my wife Ahlam, our four sons, who are two, eight, nine and 14 years old, my parents, brothers, sisters, cousins and their children.   We walked for hours and knew that eventually we would have to go through an Israeli checkpoint that was set up during the war. We were nervous and my children kept asking: "What will the army do to us?"We came to a stop about two-thirds of a mile (1km) from the checkpoint and joined a huge queue of people that filled the entire road. We spent more than four hours waiting there and my father fainted three times. There were Israeli soldiers watching us from bombed-out buildings on one side of the road and more on an empty plot of land on the other side.As we edged closer to the checkpoint we saw more soldiers above us in a tent on a hill. We think they managed the checkpoint remotely from there, watching us through binoculars and using loudspeakers to tell us what to do.There were two open-sided shipping containers near the tent. All the men had to pass through one and the women through the other, with cameras constantly trained on us. When we had gone through, Israeli soldiers asked to see our IDs and we were photographed.It was like judgement day.I saw about 50 people detained, all men, including two of my neighbours. One young man was stopped because he had lost his documents and couldn't remember his ID number. Another man next to me in the queue was called a terrorist by an Israeli soldier, before he too was taken away. They were told to strip down to their underwear and sit on the ground. Some were later asked to get dressed and leave, while others were blindfolded.I saw four blindfolded detainees, including my neighbours, taken behind a sand hill by a demolished building. When they were out of sight, we heard gunfire. I have no idea whether they were shot or not.Separately, other people who made the same journey as me were contacted by a colleague of mine in Cairo. One of them, Kamal Aljojo, said that just after he went through the checkpoint a week earlier, he had seen dead bodies, but he didn't know how they had died.My colleague also spoke to a man called Muhammed who went through the same checkpoint on 13 November. "A soldier asked me to strip off all of my clothes, even my underwear," Muhammed told the BBC. He added: "I was naked in front of everyone walking past. I felt ashamed. Suddenly a female soldier pointed her gun at me and laughed before quickly moving it away. I was humiliated." Muhammed said he had to wait naked for about two hours before he was allowed to go.Although my wife, children, parents and I all got through the checkpoint safely, two of my brothers were delayed.While we were waiting for them, an Israeli soldier shouted at a group of people in front of us who were trying to go back towards the containers to check on their relatives, who had been held up. He used a loudspeaker to tell them to move on and to stay at least 300yds (300m) away, then a soldier started shooting in the air in their direction to intimidate them. We had heard a lot of gunshots while we were queueing. Everyone was crying and my mother was sobbing: "What happened to my sons? Did they shoot them?" After well over an hour my brothers finally appeared.    The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that "individuals suspected of affiliations with terrorist organisations" were detained for preliminary inquiries, and if they remained suspects they were transferred to Israel for further questioning. Others were "promptly released", it said.It said clothes had to be removed to check for explosive vests or other weapons and detainees were clothed as soon possible. It said it did not aim to "undermine the security and dignity of the detainees" and that the IDF "operates in accordance with international law".The IDF also said it "does not shoot at civilians moving along the humanitarian corridor from the north to the south", but when young men tried to move in the opposite direction they "were met with shots for the purposes of dispersal, after they were told with a loudspeaker not to advance towards the position of the troops and continued to do so".It added that the sound of shooting was common and "the sound of gunfire alone does not constitute an indication of shooting from a specific place or of a certain type".My wife and I felt relieved as we moved on and the checkpoint disappeared from sight behind us, but we had no idea that the hardest part of the journey was yet to come.As we walked further south, I saw about 10 bodies in different places by the roadside.Other scattered, rotting body parts, were covered in flies with birds pecking at the remains. They gave off one of the foulest smells I have ever experienced.I couldn't bear the thought of my children seeing them so I screamed at the top of my lungs, telling them to look at the sky and keep walking.I saw a burned-out car with a severed human head inside. The hands of the headless rotting corpse were still holding the steering wheel. There were also bodies of dead donkeys and horses, some reduced to skeletons, and huge piles of rubbish and spoiled food. Then an Israeli tank appeared on a side road, moving towards us at breakneck speed. We were frightened and in order to get away, we had to run over corpses. Some people in the crowd tripped on the bodies. The tank changed course about 20yds (20m) before it reached the main road.Suddenly, next to the road, a building was bombed. The explosion was terrifying and shrapnel flew everywhere. I wanted the world to swallow us up.  We were shaken and exhausted but carried on towards Nuseirat camp. We arrived there in the evening and had to sleep on the pavement. It was freezing.We put my jacket around our middle sons, tucking their hands into the sleeves to try to keep them warm. We covered our youngest with my shirt. I have never been so cold in all my life.When the BBC asked about the tank and the bodies, the IDF said that "during the day, tanks move on routes that intersect with the Salah al-Din road, but there was no case in which tanks moved towards civilians moving from north to south of the Gaza Strip on the humanitarian corridor".The IDF said it did not know of any cases of piles of corpses on the Salah al-Din road but there were times when Gazan vehicles "abandoned bodies during the journey, which the IDF subsequently evacuated". The next morning we set off early for Khan Younis, Gaza's second largest city. We paid someone to take us part of the way in a cart pulled by a donkey. Then at Deir al-Balah, we got on a bus that was only meant to carry 20 people, but 30 people got on board. Some sat on the roof and others clung to the doors and windows from the outside.In Khan Younis, we tried to find a safe place to stay at a UN-run school that had been turned into a shelter, but it was full. We ended up renting a warehouse under a residential building instead and stayed there for a week.My parents, brother and sisters decided to stay in Khan Younis, but after the local market was bombed, my wife and I decided to take our children further south to Rafah to be with her family. They managed to get a lift in a car and I joined them later by bus, but it was so full I had to hang on to the outside of the door. We are now renting a small outhouse with a roof made of tin and plastic. There is nothing to protect us from falling shrapnel.  Everything is expensive and we can't get many of the things we need. If we want drinking water, we have to queue for three hours and we don't have enough food for three meals a day, so we don't eat lunch any more, only breakfast and dinner.My son used to have an egg every day. An egg - can you imagine? I can't even give him that now. All I want to do is leave Gaza and be safe with my children, even if that means living in a tent.  Additional reporting by BBC News Arabic's Abdelrahman Abutaleb in Cairo.	
20/12/2023 19:51:00	Plea to help families flee Gaza to join relatives in UK - BBC News	A Scots Palestinian doctor whose family are stuck in Gaza is calling on the UK government to help them escape the war zone.Dr Lubna Hadoura, who lives and works as a surgeon in Fife, says British citizens should be able to sponsor dependants so they can flee.Her elderly mother, three sisters, their husbands and children are trapped - some in Gaza city, others in Rafah.The UK government says it is helping people leave Gaza - but Dr Hadoura believes more needs to be done."What I'm asking the British government to do is put up some scheme similar to the family scheme that was operated with the Ukraine war allowing British citizens to reunite with their family that are not British citizens," she said."Me and the rest of the family are more than capable of supporting them and accommodating them so we will not be using any public funding whatsoever, but I want the assistance in getting them here."Hamas gunmen attacked Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.The Israeli military responded with air strikes on Gaza, and launched a ground offensive. The Hamas-run Gaza government says 20,000 people have been killed in the military campaign.The UN estimates that 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have fled or lost their homes, and there is growing concern about the limited scope for aid agencies to help them.Dr Hadoura said her 79-year-old mother Raeesa Albahnasawi has had to move seven times since October, despite health and mobility issues.She said communication was extremely difficult and that she did not know what the food and drink situation was, and whether or not her mother had her medication."I cannot describe how worried I am. The fact that we have not heard from one of my sisters for three weeks just shatters me."And she added: "The feeling of helplessness is enormous."Even though I'm putting up with this, I don't know how much longer I can."Dr Hadoura said that some other countries had come up with schemes which allowed citizens who had family in Gaza to get their relatives out.She said she was happy to sponsor her family to come to the UK.The UK government said more than 270 British nationals and their dependants had so far left Gaza so far, and that any dependants of British citizens who needed a visa could apply for one."We are working around the clock to get the rest of those out who want to leave," it said."We have a team on the ground in Cairo and at the Rafah crossing providing consular assistance."But Dr Hadoura said the situation in Gaza made it impossible for her family to get a visa and that the current application system was not fit for purpose.She added that Palestinians could not get through to access the consular services in Egypt without a foreign passport or a visa.	
20/12/2023 18:30:00	Israel Gaza: What Gaza's death toll says about the war - BBC News	At least 20,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been reported killed since Israel began bombing the territory in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attacks. BBC Verify examines what Gaza's death toll reveals about the conflict. On average, nearly 300 people have been killed each day since the start of the conflict, excluding the seven-day ceasefire, data from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry indicates. The World Health Organization's regional emergency director Richard Brennan says he considers these casualty figures trustworthy.Counting the dead is a challenge in any war zone, and doctors in Gaza say the death toll is likely to be significantly higher as it does not include bodies buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings or those not taken to hospitals.BBC Verify has looked in detail at the figures, how they compare with other conflicts and the impact on Gaza's young population.The pace of killing in this war has been "exceptionally high", says Prof Michael Spagat, who specialises in examining death tolls in conflicts around the world, such as the 2003 Iraq war, Colombia's civil conflict, wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as previous wars between Israel and Gaza."Within the series of Gaza wars stretching back to 2008, the current one is unprecedented both for the number of people killed and for the indiscriminateness of the killing," he adds.The 20,000 figure represents almost 1% of Gaza's 2.2 million population.The BBC has spoken to military experts who have described the wide variety of bombs used by Israel - some about 100lb and others as large as 2000lb - as having directly contributed to the scale of fatalities in this conflict.Being near the impact of the largest bombs is like "surfing on the Earth as the shockwave momentarily liquefies the ground", says Marc Garlasco, a former senior intelligence analyst at the Pentagon and former UN war crimes investigator, who spoke to victims and witnesses of these bombs. What makes them even more devastating is that Gaza has a very high population density. It is just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km (six miles) wide. On average, before the conflict, there were more than 5,700 people per sq km in Gaza - very similar to the average density in London.Israel began its military campaign in Gaza in the wake of Hamas' attacks, in which 1,200 people were killed, most of them civilians. Three months later, it is facing mounting pressure over the number of civilian casualties. In worldwide conflicts between 2011 and 2021, on average 90% of fatalities were civilians when explosive weapons were used on populated areas, according to the research and advocacy group Action on Armed Violence.According to US intelligence assessments seen by CNN, in this war, Israel had dropped more than 29,000 bombs on Gaza since the war began and mid-December, with 40-45% of these unguided.These unguided bombs "can miss their target by up to 30m, which is the difference between hitting a Hamas HQ and an apartment packed with civilians", says Mr Garlasco, who has worked on three previous wars in Gaza and is now a military adviser for the Dutch peace organisation PAX. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it takes precautionary measures in order to avoid damage to the civilian population. It says these measures include warnings before strikes in cases where it is possible to do so. Israel has also insisted that its record on killing civilians has been better than those in other international conflicts.The IDF says it will "abort attacks when we see unexpected civilian presence. We choose the right munition for each target - so it doesn't cause unnecessary damage."Israel also says that Hamas uses Gaza's civilian population as human shields. Women and children make up about 70% of those who have been killed in Gaza during the current conflict, says the Hamas-run health ministry.However, Hamas's figures do not distinguish between male civilians and combatants.The previous official breakdown of the deaths from Hamas's Government Media Office on 19 December, which stood at 19,667, said that more than 8,000 children and 6,200 women had been killed. It also said that 310 medical personnel, 35 civil defence personnel and 97 journalists had been killed - all of them civilians.The war is having a particularly devastating impact on Gaza's children. Nearly half of the territory's population is under 18, according to data released in 2022 by the health ministry.There have been over 52,000 people injured in the conflict so far, the health ministry says. While there are no up-to-date figures for the number of children injured, on 3 November there were reportedly 24,173 injured - comprising 8,067 children, 5,960 women and 10,146 men.Gaza is now the "most dangerous place in the world to be a child", according to the United Nation's child agency, Unicef. "Entire neighbourhoods, where children used to play and go to school, have been turned into stacks of rubble, with no life in them," said Adele Khodr, Unicef's regional director for the Middle East and North Africa. Each conflict is unique in the way it is fought, but the experts the BBC has spoken to agree that the rate of killing in Gaza is significantly bigger than in others fought recently."What we're seeing in terms of civilian deaths has already far outpaced rates of harm from any given conflict we have documented," said Emily Tripp, director of Airwars, an organisation which has monitored civilian deaths in wars and conflicts since 2014.The former Pentagon intelligence analyst Marc Garlasco said: "To find a similar density of high explosives used in a small populated area, we might have to go back to the Vietnam war for a comparable example - like the 1972 Christmas bombing, when some 20,000 tons of bombs were dropped on Hanoi during Operation Linebacker II." An estimated 1,600 Vietnamese civilians were killed in the Christmas bombings.By contrast, US-led coalition air and artillery strikes killed fewer than 20 civilians per day, on average, during the four-month offensive to drive IS out of the Syrian city of Raqqa in 2017, according to Amnesty International. It is unclear how many civilians lived there at the time, but UN officials estimated that there were between 50,000 and 100,000. Additionally, over 160,000 civilians reportedly fled their homes and became internally displaced at the time. And an Associated Press investigation suggested that between 9,000 and 11,000 civilians were killed in the nine-month battle between US-backed Iraqi forces and IS for the Iraqi city of Mosul which ended in 2017. This amounts to an estimated fewer-than-40 civilian deaths per day, on average. Mosul had an estimated population of less than two million people when IS captured the city in 2014.During the almost two years of the Ukraine war, the United Nations estimates that at least 10,000 civilians have been killed.However, the UN's human rights monitoring mission has also cautioned that the actual figure may be significantly higher given the challenges and time required for verification.And comparing casualty rates in different conflicts is difficult, in part because varying methodologies are used for estimating deaths.Israel has stated its goal is to destroy Hamas but has not been clear how many of its members it has killed. Officials have previously pointed to "thousands" and elsewhere "7,000".Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the Israeli and UK governments and others.But when asked directly, the IDF said it "does not have an exact number on the number of Hamas terrorists killed".News agency AFP reported that senior Israeli officials had suggested Israel had killed two Palestinian civilians for every one Hamas fighter. That ratio was described by the IDF's spokesman Jonathan Conricus as "tremendously positive", to CNN.The BBC has not been able to establish a clear method of verifying the number of fighters killed.Prof Michael Spagat, said he would "not be at all surprised" if around 80% of those killed were civilians.The IDF's numbers for combatants killed "have been all over the place, devoid of details and without explanations", he added. There are "no reliable figures" for the ratio of civilians to combatants killed in Gaza, say Hamit Dardagan and John Sloboda of Iraq Body Count, an organisation that examines the number of deaths in the Iraq war.

20/12/2023 17:17:00	Leaked Iran hijab documents call for mobile courts and jail terms for celebrities - BBC News	"Highly confidential" documents obtained by BBC Persian outline how Iran's government is trying to crack down on women who do not wear a hijab.Two documents from April and May reveal the judiciary could set up "mobile courts" in public places like shopping malls to punish dress code violations.They also show schoolgirls could face action by the education ministry and that celebrities could be jailed for up to 10 years for "promoting corruption".Iran's government has not commented.However, an Iranian newspaper that published a short section of one of the directives has been charged with publishing classified documents.And some of the directives were included in the controversial "Hijab and Chastity Bill" that is currently being reviewed by the Guardian Council watchdog before becoming law.Iran's parliament passed the bill in September - a year after protests erupted over the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.Women burnt their headscarves or waved them in the air at the demonstrations against clerical rule, during which hundreds of people were reportedly killed in a brutal crackdown by security forces.Although the unrest has subsided, a growing number of women and girls have stopped covering their hair in public altogether in open acts of defiance. According to the leaked documents, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi approved a series of directives aimed at coordinating action by the government and other entities to address the issue of women not covering their hair in public - several months before parliament began debating the hijab bill in secret.Security services - including the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) intelligence service, the ministry of intelligence, and the Security Police - were granted extensive powers to implement those directives, they show. Some of the directives state that:A significant portion of the directives in the leaked documents has already been implemented, including setting up hijab enforcement units inside metro stations and other public spaces; impounding cars that transport unveiled women; denying services to women violating the dress code; and closing cafes.According to the documents, the police force is required to assign a sufficient number of officers to "identify and warn women who have unveiled themselves", and that in areas where there is sufficient manpower IRGC personnel will help carry out the task.In the past few months Iranians have noticed the presence of hijab enforcers at metro stations across the capital, Tehran. The interior ministry and Tehran municipality have described them as "self-motivated forces that do not require a licence for their activities". But the documents show that their presence is the result of a government decision, which has required planning and the allocation of resources.The documents also emphasise the importance of "extensively filming and documenting the identity of those involved in unveiling", and indicate that hijab enforcers filming women and girls are affiliated to the security services.	
20/12/2023 17:09:00	'I don't want to be a number': Gazans live in fear of dying - BBC News	The children at al-Aqsa hospital do not think of the dead of Gaza in figures of thousands. Theirs is a more intimate reckoning. It is counted in beloved faces that have vanished into the fire and rubble of the war.Thirteen-year-old Rama Zaqout was sleeping when an Israeli missile struck the mosque in which she was sheltering with her family.She woke in hospital to discover that her two-year-old brother Hisham and many other family members were dead. She lists the names of those killed in a voice that seems detached from the immense loss she has experienced. It is the voice of a child still in shock at the loss of her grandparents, Hashim, Issam and Ni'ma, her aunt Reem, and her cousins Sireen, Riham and Asma. Sireen was pregnant and had a young daughter. That child was also among the dead. Rama survived with severe wounds to her left hand and right leg, but the hospital does not have the facilities to treat her injuries properly. If she is not evacuated from Gaza, she says, both limbs will be amputated. "Running and drawing were once my best hobbies," Rama says, "but without the proper treatment, I won't be able to enjoy them again… I dream of a life like other children around the world, where I can again run and draw."Near to where Rama lies, there is another girl - about 10 years old - who lies strapped into a medical brace. She appears to have suffered a serious back injury. Somebody has given the child some Barbie dolls to play with and a plastic tiara to wear. They are symbols of a vanished normality in a place of the dead and maimed. She picks up a doll with red hair and caresses it gently. A small child's screaming erupts from another ward. Adult voices can be heard trying to console him. The girl with the doll does not react, as if she is trying to close herself into a world that war cannot reach.Outside the hospital, the soundscape of Gaza is dominated by the rumble of jets, the constant whine of the military drones and the explosions when they find their target. For 24-year-old Tala Abu Nahel, who lives in Rafah in a house shared with nine other families, there is a belief that survival is a matter of luck. We first interviewed Tala more than a month ago, when she tried to escape Gaza with her severely disabled brother, Yazid, aged 17. They were turned back as they did not have foreign passports. Yazid suffers chronic seizures, made much worse now by the absence of medication.Tala explains the psychological torment of living under constant threat of attack."Every time I hear like a rocket or bomb that's going to drop on people… it's horrible to say this, but sort of it gives me this, this sort of relief, that it's not us," she says. "But that does not mean that we're fully safe. It's like every day it feels like we're next. And it feels like we're just getting by on luck. I don't think I have any more hope."Sitting in his wheelchair in the garden of the house in Rafah, Yazid glances repeatedly upwards in the direction of the drones. Tala strokes her brother's hand to comfort him. "It's been over 70 days, with nothing changing. It keeps getting worse," she says. "I think what I fear the most is that I don't want to be a number. I just don't want to die or get killed to be another one of those 20,000 people who got killed."The people of Gaza grieve their dead and live in fear of dying themselves. They flee from one unsafe place to another. They endure this because they have no choice. Every border is closed to them. Each day, the funerals of their dead bring forth corpses of all ages, wrapped in white shrouds or in plastic body bags. At the Nasser Medical Complex, a boy prostrates himself on the body of his father lying among a group of corpses. He spreads his arms to hug the dead man, his fingers grasping the plastic sheeting. "Our dad," he sobs, "I can't take it any more." An older male relative reaches in to stroke his arm. But the child is beyond consolation. Eventually he is gently drawn away from his father. The men begin to lift the corpses, one holding each end of the body bag. They move through the gates where they stop and pray for the dead. Barring a sudden declaration of ceasefire, the same rituals of mourning will be repeated tomorrow by different families in the same small place.	
20/12/2023 13:28:00	Talks on new pause in Gaza war gain urgency as Hamas chief visits Cairo - BBC News	While a full ceasefire in the Gaza Strip still looks a long way off, there are fresh signs that a new pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas could be possible.However, that would require a shift in Hamas's public position. It has consistently said that it will only free more Israeli hostages in exchange for a permanent ceasefire.Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who usually lives in Doha, has now travelled to Cairo along with a "high level" delegation for talks with Egypt's intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel.  That indicates a level of seriousness.Both Egypt and Qatar play key roles in mediation efforts and helped secure a week-long truce late last month.Israel maintains that the war in Gaza will only end when its goal of dismantling Hamas - which has governed there since 2007 - has been achieved.According to mainstream Israeli media reports, Israel has presented a plan to mediators which could secure the release of some 30 to 40 hostages. This prioritises the remaining women, as well as men who are elderly or in need of urgent medical care.It is thought that they could be exchanged for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons who have been convicted of more serious offences than the women and teenagers released in the previous deal, and that a truce could last for a week or two.The Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, told foreign diplomats on Tuesday that his country was ready for "another humanitarian pause, and additional humanitarian aid in order to enable the release of hostages". Later, after meeting a select group of families with loved ones held in captivity in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that "retrieving them is a top goal".He confirmed that the head of Israel's Mossad spy agency had been twice to Europe in recent days to promote a new release deal. On Monday, in Poland, he and his US counterpart met the Qatari prime minister.Israeli leaders have continued to assert that only strong military pressure on Hamas will bring it to the negotiating table. However, the families of the remaining hostages have openly expressed scepticism about that.Their anxiety has risen since Friday's accidental killing by Israeli forces of three hostages. In recent days, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, a smaller armed faction, have put out two videos showing a total of five men still held captive, pleading to be brought home. All appear thin and the speakers say they fear becoming victims of Israel's bombardment.Next week, the head of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Ziyad al-Nakhalah, is also due to travel to Cairo with other senior officials from his group.It is believed that more than 100 hostages remain alive in Gaza, after 105 civilians were released from captivity in late November, most of them Israeli women and children. Four hostages had been released prior to that and one had been rescued by Israeli troops. A number of bodies have also been recovered and the Israeli prime minister's office has confirmed the deaths of more than 20 people who had been held by Hamas. At a global level, there are growing calls for a complete ceasefire, including at the UN General Assembly.With the death toll now close to 20,000 in Gaza, according to local health officials in the Hamas-run territory, the UN estimates that 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have fled or lost their homes. There is growing concern about the limited scope for aid agencies to help them."Amid displacement at an unimaginable scale and active hostilities, the humanitarian response system is on the brink," Tor Wennesland, the UN's Special Co-ordinator for the Middle East Peace Process told the Security Council on Tuesday.While UN officials say much more needs to be done, a new pause in fighting could at least allow a boost in aid delivery and distribution.	
21/12/2023 15:00:00	Hamas says no more hostage releases until Israel ends war - BBC News		
20/12/2023 01:28:00	Israel Gaza: Negotiations delay UN vote urging pause in fighting - BBC News	Last-minute negotiations have delayed a UN vote on a draft resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Wrangles over the wording of the Security Council resolution, reportedly to avoid another veto by the US, mean the vote has moved to Wednesday. Increased pressure for a suspension of fighting between Israel and Hamas comes as the leader of Hamas is expected to travel to Egypt for talks. Ismail Haniyeh is due in Cairo later on Wednesday, a source told the BBC. Egypt, alongside Qatar, helped broker a truce last month that led to a week-long ceasefire and the release of some 100 hostages captured by Hamas in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians being held in Israeli jails.Israeli leaders have rejected a new ceasefire since then, saying it would only benefit Hamas.But on Tuesday Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the country was ready for another pause in the fighting to enable more hostages to be released.Hamas official Osama Hamdan told a news conference in Beirut on Monday that the group was "open to any initiative aiming for a ceasefire", but he insisted there would be "no negotiations on a hostage swap deal until the Zionist [Israeli] aggression completely stops".The original draft Security Council resolution proposed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) called for an "urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities" to allow "safe and unhindered humanitarian access".Initially diplomats thought they were very close to an agreement, 99% of the way there, but the final discussions have been complex, according to the UAE.The US says it is engaging constructively with other members to resolve outstanding issues. Late on Tuesday, the US Deputy Ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, was asked by the BBC whether the US supported the draft resolution and he said: "We're still working on the text with other players and I don't want to get ahead of where we are at this point. So let's just see how the discussions go this afternoon." Diplomats say the main sticking points are how to frame calls for a cessation of hostilities and the proposal for a UN mechanism to inspect aid going into Gaza. The US, along with Israel, opposes a ceasefire because they say it would benefit Hamas. Washington vetoed a previous Security Council resolution demanding one.The UK abstained, but every other member supported it.And Israel, according to one Security Council diplomat, is pressuring the US to veto this resolution as well, out of fear that a UN mechanism to monitor aid would prevent them from controlling deliveries in Gaza. When US state department spokesperson Matt Miller was asked whether Israel had asked the US to veto it, he said they had been in discussions with their ally, as well as other countries in the region, and they would ultimately make their own determination about what the best course of action was depending on what the final resolution stated. The current draft has already been watered down and now calls for a suspension of hostilities, rather than a sustainable cessation of hostilities, but it still includes a phrase calling for "urgent steps" towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities. The UAE's Ambassador to the UN, Lana Nusseibeh, said the priority and focus of the resolution were to have a real impact on the ground with a scaling-up of access, the opening of all land, sea and air crossing points, and ensuring Egypt has the support it needed from the UN in the form of a mechanism to streamline the process of monitoring aid. But overriding all of that, she said, was ensuring that humanitarian workers could deliver aid safely and were protected by the normal rules of de-confliction. But the Israeli government is under growing international pressure to agree to a ceasefire because of the mounting civilian casualties in Gaza. It is also facing pressure at home for a deal that would see more hostages freed, after Israeli soldiers mistakenly killed three Israeli men who had been held captive in Gaza last week.Gaza has been devastated by the war, which was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 taken hostage.Since then, more than 19,600 people have been killed in Gaza, about 70% of them women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.It reported that about 100 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli air strikes on Tuesday. Ahead of the Security Council meeting, UN aid workers in Geneva could not hide their despair at the failure of the international community to put an end to the conflict and tackle the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza.Unicef spokesman James Elder, who recently returned from the territory, told reporters that "every single child is enduring these 10 weeks of hell and not one of them can escape".He lamented that "not even lip service" had been paid to requirements, under international law, to safeguard medical facilities, food and water. Only eight of Gaza's 36 hospitals are still partially functioning, according to the World Health Organization. They are overwhelmed by casualties and facing critical shortages of medical supplies and fuel for generators, as well as providing shelter for thousands of displaced people.WHO spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris said her colleagues in Gaza had run out of "words to describe the horror" they were witnessing. They were not even able to walk through emergency wards at "for fear of stepping on people" lying on the floor "in severe pain" and asking for food and water, she added.	
18/12/2023 22:27:00	BP pauses all Red Sea shipments after rebel attacks - BBC News	Oil giant BP will pause all shipments of oil through the Red Sea after recent attacks on vessels by Houthi rebels.The firm blamed the "deteriorating security situation" in the region as Iran-backed Houthis target ships they believe are bound for Israel.Many freight firms have suspended journeys as the attacks continue.Following BP's announcement the US said it would lead an international naval operation to protect ships along the route.Countries joining the security group include the UK, Canada, France, Bahrain, Norway and Spain. In a statement, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said: "The recent escalation in reckless Houthi attacks originating from Yemen threatens the free flow of commerce, endangers innocent mariners, and violates international law."BP said it would keep its "precautionary pause under ongoing review" and monitor the region.Analysts suggested that if other large oil firms follow suit, oil prices could rise. Oil prices were higher on Monday, with international benchmark Brent trading up 2.6% to almost $79 a barrel."Right now it's unclear how significant the impact will be," said Gregory Brew, an oil historian and analyst at Eurasia Group."Though if more shipping companies divert their traffic, and if the disruption lasts more than a week or two, prices are likely to climb further."The Red Sea is one of the world's most important routes for oil and liquefied natural gas shipments, as well as for consumer goods.Analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence found that nearly 15% of goods imported into Europe, the Middle East and North Africa were shipped from Asia and the Gulf by sea. That includes 21.5% of refined oil and more than 13% of crude oil."Consumer goods will face the largest impact, though current disruptions are occurring during the off-peak shipping season," said Chris Rogers from S&P Global Market Intelligence.On Monday, one of the world's largest shipping firms said it would no longer carry Israeli cargo via the Red Sea.In an update seen by the BBC, Evergreen Line, said: "For the safety of ships and crew, Evergreen Line has decided to temporarily stop accepting Israeli cargo with immediate effect, and has instructed its container ships to suspend navigation through the Red Sea until further notice."The Houthi rebels are targeting ships travelling through the Bab al-Mandab Strait - also known as the Gate of Tears - which is a channel 20 miles (32km) wide, and known for being perilous to navigate.The rebels have declared their support for Hamas and have said they are targeting ships travelling to Israel, using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels.Instead of using the Bab al-Mandab Strait, ships will now have to take a longer route navigating around southern Africa, potentially adding about 10 days to the journey and costing millions of dollars.Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza following the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,200 people. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 18,700 have been killed since the start of the war.It is not clear if all the ships Houthi rebels have attacked were actually heading to Israel.In the most recent reported assault, the owner of the MT Swan Atlantic said the ship was hit by an "unidentified object" on Monday while in the Red Sea off Yemen despite there being no links to Israel. Inventor Chemical Tankers said: "For the record, there is no Israeli link in the ownership (Norwegian), technical management (Singapore) of the vessel nor in any parts of the logistical chain for the cargo transported."Attacks on ships have intensified in recent days, leading to shipping firms suspending travel through the strait which sits between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula and Djibouti and Eritrea on the African coast.It is the route by which ships can reach the Suez Canal from the south - itself a major shipping lane.Maersk, the world's second-biggest shipping firm, described the situation as "alarming" on Friday after a "near-miss" incident involving Maersk Gibraltar and another attack on a container ship.It was followed by Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), the world's largest shipping group, which said it would also divert its ships from the area.Its container ship, MSC PALATIUM III, was attacked on Friday as it was transiting the Red Sea. There were no injuries to the crew, but the ship has been taken out of service.CMA-CGM has also stopped shipments through the region, and Reuters has reported that Belgian oil tanker firm Euronav and Norway-based tanker group Frontline would both avoid Red Sea routes.On Monday, Inventor Chemical Tankers confirmed that the MT Swan Atlantic was targeted while travelling from France to Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean.The company said there were no injuries to its Indian crew, adding that the "crew and the ship are now assisted by the US navy and will be brought to safety under protection by naval forces".Germany's Hapag-Lloyd said it was re-routing several ships via the Cape of Good Hope, until passage through the Red Sea "will be safe again for vessels and their crews". Evergreen Line said that any container ships on longer journeys between Asia and the Mediterranean, Europe or the east coast of the US would also be diverted around the Cape of Good Hope.Peter Sand, chief analyst at freight rate data company Xeneta, said shipping firms would now be contacting customers to let them know that cargo was being delayed, adding that there was "definitely a price to pay for a situation like this".He said the industry would also face knock-on effects such as higher insurance premiums, but he said that it was in a much better position to deal with an unfolding crisis than it was when the huge Ever Given ship blocked the Suez Canal in 2021, with Covid-related supply chain issues having eased up.Sue Terpilowski of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport also pointed out that in addition to extra fuel costs and time, the war-risk insurance costs are going up "exponentially", with customers facing higher prices being passed on to them too.Additional reporting by Vivienne Nunis.	
18/12/2023 22:14:00	We've talked to Israel about making Gaza war more 'surgical', US says - BBC News	US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has said he urged Israel to protect civilians in Gaza and make the war there more "surgical".Mr Austin, who spoke after a meeting with his Israeli counterpart in Tel Aviv, reiterated US support for the offensive against Hamas.He said Washington would provide more arms, vehicles and munitions to Israel.US officials have been steadfast in their support of Israel since the 7 October attacks by Hamas.But President Joe Biden has been under growing pressure, including from within his own Democratic Party, to rein in their military campaign.Speaking on Monday, Mr Austin said the US would not "dictate timelines or terms" of the war to its ally."Our support to Israel's right to defend itself is ironclad... and that's not going to change," he said. "It's critical... that Hamas not be able to threaten Israel from Gaza or even threaten Gaza anymore."Mr Austin then said he had discussed the objectives of the military campaign and "how to reduce harm to civilians in the battlespace" with his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant"We also have some great thoughts about how to transition from high intensity operations to a lower intensity and more surgical operations," he said.Mr Gallant, meanwhile, said Israeli forces would "continue to operate in Gaza with different levels of intensity".While Mr Austin has been advising Israel to temper and target its operations since its military campaign began, he has become more outspoken as civilian deaths have increased. He earlier warned that Israel risked replacing a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.The health ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, says more than 19,400 people have been killed and 52,000 injured in the enclave since the start of the war.Mr Austin said that he had held discussions with Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, about how to reduce civilian casualties and collateral damage as the operation continues. His remarks align with the US government's recent approach to the war, with officials urging Israel to "put a premium on human life" and give clearer instructions to allow people to avoid the conflict.Senior US officials have also displayed increasing discontent at Israel's military response.Last week, Mr Biden said Israel was starting to lose global support over what he called its "indiscriminate bombing" of Gaza.But he reiterated that Israel could rely on US support and stressed that he supported its right to defend itself.Concern has mounted over the rising civilian cost of Israeli military operations in the Hamas-run territory, which began after Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October left around 1,200 Israelis dead. A Human Rights Watch report released on Monday accused Israel of "using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in the Gaza Strip, which is a war crime". 	
18/12/2023 22:04:00	Israel Gaza: Hamas releases video showing three elderly Israeli hostages - BBC News	The armed wing of Hamas, the al-Qassam Brigades, has released a video of three elderly Israeli men being held hostage in the Gaza Strip.The video shows Chaim Peri, 79, Yoram Metzger, 80, and Amiram Cooper, 85.Mr Peri can be seen addressing the camera and calling for their release.About 120 hostages are believed to still be in captivity in Gaza after a deadly Hamas attack on 7 October. Israel's military described the footage as a "criminal terror video"."It testifies to Hamas' cruelty towards innocent, very elderly civilians who are in need of medical care," said Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). "The world must act in order to deliver medical aid and check on the state of the hostages. We are morally obliged to make every and all efforts in order to bring the hostages back home," the spokesman added.The footage was released on the Telegram messaging app.The hostages taken in October are believed to be held by Hamas and allied Palestinian groups.Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law and so the BBC does not broadcast the full details of material which may have been filmed under duress.A spokesperson for Kibbutz Nir Oz, where the men were abducted from, urged US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is currently visiting Israel, to secure their release."We appreciate any sign of life from the hostages, but time is running out," the spokesperson said."The immediate release of all those abducted, through any potential negotiation avenue, is urgently required."Each passing day exacerbates their situation. Recent events sadly illustrate that the hostages' situation is deteriorating with each passing day, particularly for older individuals."An estimated 240 hostages were taken to Gaza during Hamas's 7 October attacks that killed about 1,200 in southern Israel.Israel has launched a massive retaliatory operation it says is aimed at destroying Hamas. More than 18,000 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, with hundreds of thousands displaced.During a six-day ceasefire at the end of November, 105 hostages were released in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. On Friday, three Israeli hostages mistakenly killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza were shot dead while holding a white cloth, an Israeli military official said.The hostages - Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 - were killed in the Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City.According to an Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the men emerged shirtless from a building, with one carrying a stick with a white cloth.One of the soldiers, the official added, felt threatened, as the men were at a distance of tens of metres, declared them "terrorists" and opened fire. Two were immediately killed while the third, wounded, returned to the building.A cry for help was heard in Hebrew and the battalion commander ordered the troops to cease fire. The wounded hostage later re-emerged, and was shot and killed, the official said.It is not clear if the hostages had been abandoned by their captors or escaped.An IDF official said the case was "against our rules of engagement" and an investigation was happening at the "highest level".Families of the remaining hostages have urged the Israeli government to reach a new truce for at least some of the captives to be freed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has deflected the calls, insisting "military pressure is necessary both for the return of the hostages and for victory".Speaking to reporters on Monday, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby addressed rumours of a possible new hostage deal, and said talks were not at a point where an agreement was imminent.	
18/12/2023 17:04:00	Gaza health ministry says Israeli strikes kill 110 in Jabalia - BBC News	At least 110 people have been killed in Israeli air strikes in northern Gaza's Jabalia area, the Hamas-run health ministry says, as fighting continues across the Palestinian territory.Fifty people were reportedly killed and dozens trapped under rubble when three homes in Jabalia refugee camp were hit.Videos showed the bodies of small children lined up at a medical centre.The Israeli military said it had been conducting operations against Hamas "terrorist infrastructure" in Jabalia.It came as the US defence secretary arrived in Tel Aviv for talks with Israeli leaders that were expected to focus on how to lower the intensity of the fighting to protect civilians.The UN Security Council was also expected to vote later on a resolution calling for an "urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities", amid reports of discussions on a potential new deal to secure the release of more Israeli hostages held by Hamas.Gaza has been devastated by 10 weeks of war triggered by an unprecedented attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed and about 240 taken hostage. Since then, more than 19,400 people have been killed in Gaza, about 70% of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Witnesses and local journalists said Israeli missiles struck a block of houses in Jabalia refugee camp where three families had been living on Sunday night.On Monday morning, Palestinian media cited the Hamas-run health ministry's director general as saying that at least 50 people had been killed when the homes of the al-Bursh and Alwan families were bombed. He added that it brought to 110 the death toll in the wider Jabalia area since Sunday.Local journalists also posted videos on social media showing what they said were the bodies of nine children on the floor of the Jabalia Medical Centre. One identified the children as members of the al-Bursh and Suleiman families.  Another 20 to 30 people were reportedly trapped beneath the rubble of the destroyed homes.BBC Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is currently in Istanbul, says verifying reports from the north is very difficult because of communication and access problems.But, he adds, Jabalia refugee camp has been a focus of Israeli ground operations over the past few weeks. And air strikes have intensified since Israeli tanks reportedly pulled out of the camp two days ago.When asked about the Jabalia strikes by AFP news agency, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stressed that it went to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties."When planning a target, the IDF devotes significant time and resources to preparing the attack and where feasible, uses various tools, including advance warnings, roof knocking, street knocking, target clearing operations and a variety of professional calculations," it said.The IDF separately announced that its troops had been conducting operations in Jabalia and that they had uncovered cash worth almost $1.4m (£1.1m) in suitcases alongside weapons in the home of a senior Hamas figure.Gaza's health ministry also said that a 13-year-old girl was killed when an Israeli tank shell hit the maternity building of Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis on Sunday night. The girl, Dunia Abu Mohsen, had been receiving treatment after losing a leg in a previous strike in al-Amal that killed her parents, brother and sister.Another eight people, including journalist Haneen al-Qashtan, were reportedly killed in a strike in Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza.US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin was expected to tell Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and war cabinet in their meetings on Monday that Israel had to move away from its major combat operations to a more limited conflict targeting Hamas while shielding civilians.At a news conference with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, Mr Austin said protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza was "both a moral duty and a strategic imperative".Asked about a transition to lower intensity warfare, he stressed: "This is Israel's operation, and I'm not here to dictate timelines or terms."The UK, Germany and France added to the growing global pressure for a ceasefire over the weekend, saying that too many civilians had been killed.European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell echoed those comments on Monday, saying: "We are witnessing an appalling lack of distinction in Israel's military operation in Gaza."In Israel, there are calls for any pause in the fighting to be linked to a new hostage release deal, after last week's mistaken killing by Israeli forces of three men who had been held captive in Gaza.In another development on Monday, Human Rights Watch accused Israel's military of "using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare"."Israeli forces are deliberately blocking the delivery of water, food and fuel, while wilfully impeding humanitarian assistance, apparently razing agricultural areas, and depriving the civilian population of objects indispensable to their survival," it alleged.Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy called the report "a lie"."Israel has excess capacity to inspect more than twice as many aid trucks as are entering Gaza. We're still pumping water into Gaza through two pipelines and have placed no restrictions on entry of food and water. Direct your anger to Hamas, which hijacks aid," he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.	
18/12/2023 16:50:00	Gazans trapped in church fear being shot, says relative - BBC News	Civilians trapped in a church in Gaza City are living in an "unreal" sense of fear, a relative of one of those confined there has said. Fifi Saba, whose sister is trapped inside the Holy Family Church, said people were scared to move out of fear of being shot.A mother and her daughter were killed inside the church by sniper fire on Saturday, the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said.Pope Francis condemned the attack."A mother, Mrs Nahida Khalil Anton, and her daughter, Samar Kamal Anton, were killed, and others were wounded by the shooters while they were going to the bathroom," he said on Sunday."Some say, 'This is terrorism. This is war.' Yes, it is war. It is terrorism," he added.Ms Saba, a Catholic from Gaza who now lives in the US, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she was worried about her sister, her brother-in-law and their two children aged 9 and 12, who were trapped there.She said she was receiving news about them through a family member, who was able to speak to her sister once a day. "They are locked in," she said. "They can't really see the street very much, and most of the time they're cut off from the world. They don't have their phones, they don't have internet, they don't have the news."She said her sister often asked for news about what was happening outside, and was able to hear bombs overhead. "The fear they have been living is unreal," she said. Ms Saba said she received a message in which her sister said the "situation is really difficult". "I found out later that day that when she said the situation is very difficult, she was witnessing the killing of the two people - the two women in the church," Ms Saba said. Ms Saba added that the family had spent "a couple of hours" hiding on the ground in the church compound, because "they believed the Israelis were shooting anything that moves". "They were terrified to go to the bathroom, because the women were shot trying to get to the toilet," she said, adding that the water to the church had been cut off for a few days. Food was also scarce, she said, with those trapped living off boiled spaghetti for three weeks. "And I think the past couple of days they have had no food," she said. On Saturday, the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said two Christian women - named as Nahida and her daughter Samar - were shot and killed while walking to a building in the church complex known as the Sister's Convent. "One was killed as she tried to carry the other to safety," a statement said. Seven more people were shot and wounded as they "tried to protect others inside the church compound" on Saturday.The patriarchate said no warning had been given and added: "They were shot in cold blood inside the premises of the parish, where there are no belligerents."The patriarchate said that earlier on Saturday an Israeli tank fired on part of the church compound with 54 disabled people inside. It caused a fire that destroyed the building's generator, the only source of electricity, and some of the disabled people can no longer use their respirators, the statement said.In response to the church's letter, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said it took "claims regarding harm to sensitive sites with the utmost seriousness".It said an incident with its troops took place near a church in the Shejaiya area, and that an "initial review suggests that IDF troops" were operating against a Hamas "threat that they identified in the area of the church"."The IDF is conducting a thorough review of the incident," it said. The BBC has contacted the IDF for further comment on the accusations of indiscriminate shooting.  It is unclear why the church is allegedly being targeted, but Ms Saba said she did not believe Hamas fighters were inside, and that her sister had not mentioned their presence. "We've seen in the past 72 days how hospitals are attacked, schools are attacked, libraries are attacked, markets are attacked, bakeries are attacked."I find it hard to believe if that's the narrative they're using," she said. Layla Moran, a UK member of parliament, also told the BBC that members of her extended family, who are Christian Palestinians, were trapped in the church, having sought refuge after their home was bombed in the first week of the war."I'm now no longer sure they are going to survive until Christmas," she said, adding that they no longer had access to food or water. The family members said soldiers had entered the church compound in the last 24 hours and had taken over a room in a building. The family has sent a photo, seen by the BBC, of two bodies lying in a street outside the church building. Ms Moran's relatives say the bodies have been decaying for days. Ms Moran said there had been no explanation as to why Israeli soldiers might target the church and no warnings or leaflets were sent to people sheltering there."It does feel like it's making a mockery of keeping civilians safe," she said. Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to "eradicate" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group in its 7 October attacks. The Israeli military has repeatedly said it does not target civilians. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 18,700 people have been killed and 50,000 injured in the enclave since the start of the war.

Mr Sisi, who is 69, first became president in 2014, a year after he had led the military's overthrow of his Islamist predecessor Mohammed Morsi. Mr Sisi won again in 2018. The victory in the latest election means he will be in power until 2030, when he is barred by the constitution from running again.Under his leadership, huge sums of money have been spent on big infrastructure projects.Roads have been expanded and flyovers built, and a new capital costing billions of dollars has been constructed near Cairo but is barely inhabited.Critics say this has drained much of the country's economic resources and created unprecedented levels of debt that have crippled the economy. In the past nine months, the Egyptian pound has lost more than 50% of its value against the US dollar. With the Egyptian economy heavily dependent on imports, the prices of basic commodities have skyrocketed beyond the reach of many households and a black market for foreign currency has flourished.Official figures show that nearly 30% of Egypt's 100 million population lives below the poverty line. Egyptian opposition groups complain they cannot operate effectively due to a constant crackdown on dissent.Human rights campaigners are also complaining about tight security restrictions. They say it is increasingly difficult to document alleged abuses.Egyptian authorities deny the allegations.	
18/12/2023 14:34:00	Israel Gaza: Hostages shot by IDF put out 'SOS' sign written with leftover food - BBC News	Three Israeli hostages mistakenly killed by soldiers in Gaza on Friday had used leftover food to write signs pleading for help, Israel says.The men had been staying at the building next to where they were shot "for some period of time", according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The head of the IDF told troops that they are "absolutely not" permitted to shoot those surrendering.  "The IDF doesn't shoot a person who raises their hands," said Herzi Halevi.He said Gazans with a white flag must be arrested and not shot "if they lay down their arms and raise their hands". About 120 hostages are believed to be still in captivity in the Gaza Strip, held by Hamas and allied Palestinian groups.Israel is under increasing pressure for a deal to free more hostages.Israeli officials have admitted that killing the three men who were holding a white flag was a breach of "rules of engagement". They were seized and taken to Gaza during the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed around 1,200 in southern Israel.Israel has launched a massive retaliatory operation it says is aimed at destroying Hamas. More than 18,000 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the local health authorities, with hundreds of thousands of others pushed out of their homes. The Israeli hostages - Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 - were killed in the Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City on Friday as Israeli troops face stiff resistance.According to an Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the men emerged shirtless from a building, with one carrying a stick with a white cloth.One of the soldiers, the official added, felt threatened, as the men were at a distance of tens of metres, declared them "terrorists" and opened fire. Two were immediately killed while the third, wounded, returned to the building.A cry for help was heard in Hebrew and the battalion commander ordered the troops to cease fire. The wounded hostage later re-emerged, and was shot and killed, the official said.It is not clear if the hostages had been abandoned by their captors or escaped. On Sunday, the IDF said a search of the building was carried out, revealing the messages "SOS" and "Help, 3 hostages" written on fabric.Officials believe the hostages had been there for some time.Since the end of a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas earlier this month, families of the hostages have urged the Israeli government to reach a new truce for at least some of the captives to be freed. The initial deal led to the release of more than 100 hostages, in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has deflected the calls, insisting "military pressure is necessary both for the return of the hostages and for victory".Amid mounting Palestinian civilian casualties, Israeli authorities have come under growing international pressure, including from the country's main ally, the US.On Sunday, France's Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna went to Israel calling for an "immediate and durable truce".  Her Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen said a ceasefire would be an error, describing it as a gift to Hamas. The UK and Germany have also called for a "sustainable ceasefire", whilst stopping short of saying it should be immediate.Vast areas of the Gaza Strip have been destroyed by the Israeli bombardment, and the United Nations has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe amid widespread shortages of basic supplies.Images on social media on Sunday showed Gaza residents climbing on aid lorries.With no let-up in the fighting, the IDF published images of what it said was Hamas's largest attack tunnel so far. The tunnel - in some places wide enough for cars to pass through - was some 400m from the Erez border crossing with Israel, the IDF said.	
18/12/2023 12:21:00	Kuwait country profile - BBC News	Oil-rich Kuwait is a tiny country nestling at the top of the Gulf. Flanked by powerful neighbours Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran, its strategic location and massive oil reserves make it one of the world's richest countries per capita. A conservative state with a Sunni Muslim majority and a US ally, Kuwait stands out from the other Gulf monarchies for having the most open political system. The emirate's parliament has the most powers of any elected body in the Gulf and opposition MPs openly criticise the ruling Al-Sabah familyThe ruling family retains full control over key government and executive posts and the emir has the last say in political matters. He also has the power to override or dissolve parliament, and call elections.But tensions persist between parliament and the cabinet, controlled by the Sabahs, and the government is facing increasing calls for radical political reform from the opposition. Emir: Sheikh Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-SabahSheikh Mishal became emir, aged 83, on the death of his half-brother Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah in December 2023. His appointment earlier as crown prince (next in line to the throne) was seen as a sign that Kuwait's rulers wanted to avoid significant change, such as a transition to the next generation of leaders.His half-brother Sheikh Nawaf became emir in 2020.  He was defence minister when Iraq invaded and occupied Kuwait in 1990, sparking the beginning of the Gulf War, and later went onto serve as interior minister.Compared to his predecessor, who served as emir for more than a decade and shaped the country's foreign policy for 50 years, Sheikh Nawaf's time as ruler was relatively short, just three years.The authorities place limits on media freedom, and legislation provides for punishments for criticism of the emir and the government. State broadcasters operate alongside privately-owned outlets. Internet use is among the highest in the region.Some key dates in Kuwait's history:1700s - Nomadic tribes from central Arabia settle in the bay of Kuwait City, among them the Al-Sabah family whose descendants now rule Kuwait. 1899 - British protectorate: Britain assumes control of foreign and defence policy amid fears of an expanding Ottoman Empire. 1930s - Oil: The discovery of massive oil reserves revolutionises the country's economy.1961- Kuwait gains independence from Britain.1963 - British military intervention forces Iraq to abandon its territorial claims and recognize Kuwait's independence. Kuwait becomes the first Arab country in the Gulf to establish an elected parliament.1990-91 - First Gulf War: Iraqi invasion leads to a US-led military campaign to liberate Kuwait. A US-led and UN-backed bombing aerial campaign begins in Kuwait and Iraq. By late February 1991, allied forces reach Kuwait City. Iraqi forces torch oil wells as they pull out. 2003 - Tens of thousands of soldiers converge on the Kuwait-Iraq border for a US-led military campaign to disarm and oust Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in Second Gulf War. 2003 - Political reform: Emir issues a landmark decree separating the post of prime minister from the crown prince.2005 - Kuwaiti women win the right to vote and run in parliamentary elections.2012 - Unprecedented protests call for government reforms. 2015 - Kuwait and four other Gulf states take part in Saudi-led air strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen.Suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Kuwait kills 27 and injures 227 people. Islamic State claims responsibility for what is the largest terror attack in Kuwait's history.2020 - Covid pandemic exacerbates Kuwait's economic crisis, and country rercords a budget deficit of $46bn.	
18/12/2023 06:07:00	Israel-Gaza war: Man on hunger strike hospitalised calling for ceasefire - BBC News	A man originally from Gaza has been hospitalised after being on hunger strike for nearly two months over the Israel-Gaza war.Wael Arafat, 28, moved from Deir Al Balah to Bristol when he was young and is calling for a ceasefire.His mother, Patricia Davis-Thomas, said he is "very unwell" and that he has 17 family members who have been killed.She explained that seven days after he started the hunger strike, they had to call for an ambulance.Israel says that for the first time since the fighting began in October, aid has entered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing. Until now there have only been limited deliveries through the Rafah Crossing with Egypt. An increasing number of countries are calling for a ceasefire. in the Israel-Gaza war.Mr Arafat from Bristol has been refusing food at the Royal United Hospital in Bath. Speaking to BBC Arabic, Mr Arafat said: "I probably have a week or two before I die. "I want the world to do something and not for me, but I want the world to do something for the people of Gaza, for the children, the elderly and the youth."Ms Davis-Thomas said: "He came to this country to be safe. "He's been traumatised, but he's always had a very strong link to Palestine, even though he left there when he was very young. "He expresses his distress around the children that are being harmed. He remembers himself as a child living in Palestine, under occupation." Mr Arafat told the BBC he did not want to stop the hunger strike until, "they hear us and know that we are not animals, we are humans and when I see the ceasefire in Gaza."Ms Davis-Thomas added: "I took in a young lad of 14. I brought him up in the way he should have been brought up, in the way that his family would have wanted him to be brought up.""So I learnt about his culture. I knew nothing about Palestine before he came to me. I helped him in his education. I got him to this point.""Now I just feel I'm going to lose my son and nobody has a right to die like that. I'm trying to save my son here."She said she wanted people to think about those in Palestine running for their and their children's lives. Ms David-Thomas said he is "critical" in hospital and has managed to encourage him to have a little fluid.She added: "I tell him every day in hospital - you have a right to protest. We all have a right to protest. But you don't have to take it to the point where you have to die.""He wants to be heard, he doesn't want to die. He's expressed that to the doctors and they are trying to do their best by him."But if he doesn't take fluids, if he isn't encouraged to start to eat, then he will die."Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the Israeli government is still trying to complete the recovery of all the hostages held in Gaza, saying military pressure on Hamas was needed to secure their release.Mr Netanyahu has indicated that talks are happening, and there are reports which suggest both Egypt and Qatar are involved in the discussions.But Hamas has said there will be no negotiations to release hostages "unless the aggression against our people stops once and for all".Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

17/12/2023 18:42:00	UK MP Layla Moran's family among hundreds trapped in Gaza church - BBC News	UK MP Layla Moran says her relatives are among hundreds of civilians trapped in a Catholic Church in Gaza City as Israeli forces operate nearby.The Liberal Democrat says her family are "days away from dying" without access to water or food.The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem say a mother and daughter were killed inside the Holy Family Church complex on Saturday by sniper fire.The IDF said it found no evidence to show the incident took place.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said: "During the dialogue between the IDF and representatives of the community, no reports of a hit on the church, nor civilians being injured or killed, were raised."A review of the IDF's operational findings support this."The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said two Christian women - named as Nahida and her daughter Samar - were shot and killed while walking to a building in the church complex known as the Sister's Convent. "One was killed as she tried to carry the other to safety," a statement said. Seven more people were shot and wounded as they "tried to protect others inside the church compound" on Saturday. The patriarchate said no warning had been given and added: "They were shot in cold blood inside the premises of the parish, where there are no belligerents."The patriarchate said that earlier on Saturday an Israeli tank fired on part of the church compound with 54 disabled people inside. It caused a fire that destroyed the building's generator, the only source of electricity, and some of the disabled people can no longer use their respirators, the statement said.Members of Ms Moran's extended family - a grandmother, her son, his wife and their 11-year-old twins - are Christian Palestinians who sought refuge inside the church after their home was bombed in the first week of the war.They have been staying on mattresses along with dozens of others in rooms in the Holy Family Church for more than 60 days."I'm now no longer sure they are going to survive until Christmas," Ms Moran told the BBC.They have been keeping in touch with Ms Moran and other family members sporadically through WhatsApp messages and calls - though they have no internet and power is intermittent. A sixth member of the family - a grandfather - died last month after not being able to get to hospital to receive medical treatment, Ms Moran says.The five remaining members say they now no longer have access to food or water, and the last remaining generator - which was pumping water from wherever they could get it - has stopped working in the church.They say soldiers entered the church compound in the last 24 hours and took over a room in a building. Earlier in the week, the family heard shots being fired and saw bullet casings in the church compound. They say two men were killed on Tuesday while they were coming and going from the building - a bin collector and a janitor. The family have sent a photo, seen by the BBC, of two bodies lying on a street outside the church building. Ms Moran's relatives say the bodies have been decaying outside for days. The BBC has not verified the circumstances of what the image shows.Ms Moran says there has been no explanation as to why Israeli soldiers would target the church and no warnings or leaflets were sent to people sheltering there."It does feel like it's making a mockery of keeping civilians safe," Ms Moran adds.Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to "eradicate" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group.Early on in the war Israel told people in northern Gaza to move to southern Gaza for their safety. It has also paused military activity in some areas for short periods to allow people to leave. There was also a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to allow a swap of some Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.However Israel has also bombed southern Gaza, where it told people to go, and a large number of Palestinians have remained in Gaza City and other northern areas.Ms Moran says she has been in touch with a number of countries about getting her relatives out of Gaza, but the situation is "incredibly complex".She adds that the family have considered trying to travel to Rafah in southern Gaza near the border with Egypt but say it is too dangerous while no ceasefire is in place.Hamas broke through Israel's heavily guarded perimeter on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages - some of whom were released during the brief truce.The health ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, says more than 18,700 people have been killed and 50,000 injured in the enclave since the start of the Gaza war.	
17/12/2023 15:34:00	South African hostage Gerco van Deventer freed by al-Qaeda militants - BBC News	Militant Islamists linked to al-Qaeda have freed a South African paramedic taken hostage in Libya more than six years ago, a charity has said. Gift of the Givers said it had facilitated the "unconditional" release of Gerco van Deventer.The charity described Van Deventer as the longest-held South African hostage.He was seized by an unnamed group in Libya in 2017, sold to militant Islamists in Mali a year later, and released "into" Algeria, it added. A Malian security source confirmed to AFP news agency that Van Deventer, 48, had been freed. It quoted a humanitarian source as saying that the paramedic was freed on the border between Mali and Algeria. Large parts of Libya have been lawless since Nato-backed forces overthrew and killed long-serving ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, while Mali is battling an Islamist insurgency and a rebellion by separatist forces in the north. Gift of the Givers, a South Africa-based charity, said that Algeria's security agencies had taken Van Deventer to hospital for a check-up following his release. "We await the next step on his health and arrangements to bring him home to be reunited with wife Shereen and son Asher. It has been six agonising years of prayer, patience, and hope," the charity said in a Facebook post.Van Deventer was an emergency paramedic who was working for a security company when he was seized on 3 November 2017, while on his way to a power plant construction site around 1,000km (600 miles) south of Libya's capital Tripoli.Three Turkish engineers who were abducted with him were freed about seven months later, but he remained in captivity. In March his family made a fresh plea for his release.Gift of the Givers has been involved in previous efforts to free Van Deventer and other hostages held in the Sahel region. The charity said the al-Qaeda affiliate, Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin, had asked for a ransom of $3m (£2.4m) in 2018, and the charity negotiated the amount down to $500,000.However, Van Deventer's family and employer could not afford the amount,  and the militants finally released him "unconditionally" on Saturday, it added. Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and other extremist groups in North and West Africa have long used kidnapping for ransom as a way of raising money.The group, which has its roots in Algeria's bitter civil war in the 1990s, operates across the Sahel region south of the Sahara Desert and within Mali and Burkina Faso.In 2013, former colonial power France sent 5,000 troops to Mali to fight the group and its allies, and in 2020 killed AQIM leader Abdelmalek Droukdel.But France pulled out last year following a coup in the West African state, and growing unpopularity over its military operation.Now Russia's notorious mercenary Wagner group has been hired by Mali's military junta to fight the militants. 	
17/12/2023 13:08:00	Israel Gaza: Lord Cameron supports 'sustainable ceasefire' and warns over deaths - BBC News	The foreign secretary has said he would like to see a "sustainable ceasefire" in the Israel-Gaza conflict. Lord Cameron also warned "too many civilians have been killed" in Gaza. More than 18,000 people have been killed, including thousands of children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.His intervention in a Sunday Times article marks a shift in tone from the UK government, but stops short of calling for an immediate ceasefire. Penning a joint article with Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, Lord Cameron said he supported a ceasefire only if it was sustainable in the long term. He said: "Our goal cannot simply be an end to fighting today. It must be peace lasting for days, years, generations. "We therefore support a ceasefire, but only if it is sustainable."Earlier this week the UK and Germany abstained over a United Nations resolution, backed by 153 countries, demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.On Sunday France, which was among the countries which voted for the resolution, called for an "immediate and durable truce" in the conflict, ahead of a meeting between the French and Israeli foreign ministers in Tel Aviv. Seeking to explain the UK's position, Lord Cameron wrote: "We do not believe that calling right now for a general and immediate ceasefire, hoping it somehow becomes permanent, is the way forward."He added: "Would Hamas stop firing rockets? Would it release the hostages? Would its murderous ideology change? An unsustainable ceasefire, quickly collapsing into further violence, would only make it harder to build the confidence needed for peace."Instead the UK and Germany are pushing for further humanitarian pauses to get more aid in and more hostages out. Lord Cameron's comments amplify Rishi Sunak's line set out at Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions. "We have been consistent that what we support is a sustainable ceasefire, which means Hamas must stop launching rockets into Israel and release all the hostages," Mr Sunak said. Appearing on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said: "In order for a ceasefire to be sustainable, we have to ensure we remove the threat of Hamas from Israel..."So, that's why we continue to support Israel in its right to self-defence, to remove the threat of Hamas, and at the same time to get those hostages back."Asked if he thought Israel had gone too far, Mr Dowden said: "I wouldn't characterise it as Israel going too far. Israel is dealing with a very difficult situation."He said the UK continued to urge Israel to exercise restraint but added: "If you're going after an enemy that literally hides underneath hospitals, hides amongst the civilian population, you are going to sustain high levels of civilian casualties."The offensive into Gaza, triggered by Hamas's deadly 7 October attack on Israel which killed 1,200 people, has led to vast areas of the territory being flattened. In a sign attitudes are shifting, in the article, the UK and German foreign ministers warned that Israel "should do more to discriminate sufficiently between terrorists and civilians". They also said more aid must reach Gaza, amid warnings from the United Nations of a humanitarian catastrophe due to widespread shortages of basic supplies.Israel's main ally the US has also expressed unease over the failure of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration to reduce civilian casualties. Deflecting that pressure on Saturday, Mr Netanyahu said: "Military pressure is necessary both for the return of the hostages and for victory. Without military pressure... we have nothing."	
17/12/2023 12:17:00	France calls for 'immediate and durable' ceasefire in Gaza - BBC News	France has called for an "immediate and durable truce" in the Israel-Hamas war, saying that it is deeply concerned about the situation in Gaza.  Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna added that too many civilians were being killed. Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said a ceasefire would be an error, describing it as a gift to Hamas. The UK and Germany earlier called for a "sustainable ceasefire", but stopped short of saying it should be immediate.Ms Colonna arrived in Tel Aviv on Sunday for a meeting with her Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen.A statement released by the French Foreign Ministry before her visit said she would call for a truce, which should "lead to a lasting ceasefire with the aim of releasing all hostages and delivering aid to Gaza". During the meeting with Mr Cohen, the French foreign minister added that the victims of the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October should not be forgotten. Mr Cohen repeated the Israeli government's position that there would be no ceasefire. But he said that France could play an important role in preventing the escalation of regional tensions. He added that while Israel "has no intention to start another front" on its northern border with Lebanon, it would do "whatever it takes" to protect Israeli citizens.  Israel has been engaged in regular cross-border exchanges of fire with armed groups in southern Lebanon, most notably with the Iran-backed Hezbollah. Earlier on Sunday, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called for a "sustainable ceasefire" in the conflict. In a joint article in the Sunday Times, Lord Cameron said he supported a ceasefire only if it was sustainable in the long term. Although this marks a shift in tone from the UK government, it does not go as far as calling for an immediate ceasefire.On Tuesday, the UK and Germany abstained over a United Nations resolution to this effect, backed by 153 countries."We do not believe that calling right now for a general and immediate ceasefire, hoping it somehow becomes permanent, is the way forward," Lord Cameron wrote seeking to explain the UK's decision."Would Hamas stop firing rockets? Would it release the hostages... an unsustainable ceasefire, quickly collapsing into further violence, would only make it harder to build the confidence needed for peace."Instead the UK and Germany are pushing for further humanitarian pauses to get more aid in and more hostages out.Catherine Colonna is also scheduled to meet the families of French hostages still being held by Hamas during her visit to Israel.Referring to allegations of sexual assault during the 7 October attacks, Ms Colonna said France "believed the words of the victims" and those who witnessed the alleged attacks. Earlier this week, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) recovered the body of 28-year-old French-Israeli hostage Elya Toledano. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the Israeli government is still trying to complete the recovery of all the hostages held in Gaza, saying military pressure on Hamas was needed to secure their release. Mr Netanyahu has indicated that talks are happening, and there are reports which suggest both Egypt and Qatar are involved in the discussions. But Hamas has said there will be no negotiations to release hostages "unless the aggression against our people stops once and for all".On Friday, the IDF accidentally killed three Israeli hostages during its operations in Gaza. Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 were shot at whilst holding a white cloth - the IDF said the incident was "against our rules of engagement" and that it was investigating the incident. There are still more than 120 people still being held in Gaza, and the accidental killing has added pressure on Israeli authorities to reach a deal for their release. France's Foreign Ministry has also demanded Israel explain an airstrike which killed one of its staff in Rafah this week. The employee died of his injuries as a result of the strike in Rafah, which the foreign ministry said also killed other civilians.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 18,700 people have been killed and over 50,000 injured in the territory since the start of the war. 	
17/12/2023 08:34:00	Tunisia's historic Kairouan walls collapse, killing three - BBC News	Three stonemasons have died after a section of the historic walls around the Old City of Kairouan in Tunisia collapsed on Saturday. Officials say a 30m section of the wall near the Gate of the Floggers crashed to the ground. Two others were also injured in the accident and are said to have suffered fracturesAn investigation has been opened into the accident. Authorities say it could be linked to recent heavy rain. Moez Tria, a spokesperson for the Civil Protection Department said a perimeter had been set up to stop people from walking under part of the wall which is still at risk of further collapse.  The city of Kairouan was founded in 670 AD and is one of North Africa's holiest cities. It was the capital of the Muslim world in North Africa for four centuries, before Tunis was chosen as Tunisia's political capital in the 12th century. Kairouan became a Unesco World Heritage site in 1988 and is home to the Mosque of the Three Doors, the oldest known mosque with a sculpted facade. Unesco describes the mosque as "an architectural masterpiece that served as a model for several other Maghreban mosques".	
17/12/2023 05:52:00	More than 60 migrants feared drowned off Libya, IOM says - BBC News	More than 60 migrants are believed to have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of Libya, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.Citing survivors, the UN agency said on Saturday the vessel left the city of Zuwara with around 86 people on board. It said high waves swamped the boat and that 61 migrants, including children, were missing and presumed dead.Libya is among the main departure points for migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean and enter Europe.The IOM estimates that more than 2,200 people have drowned while attempting the crossing this year alone, making it one of the most dangerous migration routes in the world. The agency said most of the victims of the latest incident were from Nigeria, Gambia, and other African countries, the AFP news agency reports. It also said 25 survivors had been transferred to a Libyan detention centre and were being given medical support. Writing on X, formerly Twitter, an IOM spokesperson called the death toll for this year a "dramatic number which unfortunately demonstrates that not enough is being done to save lives at sea".In June, at least 78 people died and another 100 were rescued after a fishing boat sank off southern Greece.The Mediterranean crossings frequently see scores of migrants crowded onto boats too small to safely hold them. Those making the trip are typically hoping to land in Italy before making their way to other countries in Europe, some escaping conflict or persecution, others in search of work. More than 153,000 migrants have arrived in Italy this year from Tunisia and Libya, according to the UN's refugee agency.On Saturday, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had talks in Rome with his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni and Albania's PM Edi Rama on how to reduce illegal migration to Europe. At the start of this year, Mr Sunak made stopping small boat crossings in the English Channel one of the five key priorities of his government.	
17/12/2023 02:46:00	Why US-Palestinian families are having 'the talk' - BBC News	After the shooting of three college students in New England and a string of other incidents, Palestinian Americans say they are worried about their safety. When Samer Elbandak heard that three young Palestinian men were shot over American Thanksgiving weekend in Burlington, Vermont, he immediately feared for his 16-year-old daughter.His daughter, who lives in Florida, is vocal about the plight of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. On her Instagram page, the Palestinian flag is prominently displayed.Embracing her identity is something that Mr Elbandak, a Palestinian-American Christian who was born and raised in Bethlehem and who immigrated to San Francisco 30 years ago, had always encouraged.But a week after the shooting of Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ali Ahmad - three 20-year-old Palestinian-American students - Mr Elbandak said he decided to fly to Florida to have a difficult conversation with his daughter. "I explained to her that she needs to be very careful," he said. "There are some people that are blind, that are full of hatred."Palestinian parents in the US like Mr Elbandak say they are increasingly having their version of "the talk" - a conversation about encountering racism that has long been held in African-American and other minority households - after a recent string of incidents where people who are visibly Palestinian have been attacked.Police in Burlington said they are still investigating whether the 24 November shooting of the three men was a hate crime. The suspect, Jason Eaton, pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges. The victims of the attack maintain they were targeted because of their ethnicity. They were speaking a mix of Arabic and English at the time of the attack, and two of them were wearing keffiyehs - a traditional, Palestinian black-and-white scarf that often serves as a symbol of Palestinian identity and solidarity. Some say the incident has left them fearful that being visibly Palestinian in the US has become a risk since the Israel-Gaza war erupted on 7 October.Among those who felt this concern is Anne Bordonaro, a mother of two Palestinian college-aged men born and raised in Burlington."I looked at the picture of the three young men and I just felt a gut punch," Ms Bordonaro said. "I said, those are my kids." She then called her two boys and had a "painful conversation", in which she suggested they avoid wearing their keffiyehs in public. "My younger son often wears one, it's just a symbol of identity, it is just part of who he is," Ms Bordonaro said, but she added she worried it made him a target. At the time of the Burlington shootings, the Palestinian community in the US - a small diaspora of around 220,000 - was already reeling from the murder on 14 October of a six-year-old Illinois boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume. Prosecutors have accused the suspect in Wadea's death of deliberately targeting the child and his mother for being Palestinian. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) said it had received an "unprecedented" amount of reports of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias since 7 October, recording a total of 2,171 requests for help across the US as of December.The wife of a Harvard professor was caught on video harassing a student for wearing a keffiyeh, calling it a "terrorist scarf". On 7 November, a man wearing a keffiyeh was allegedly assaulted while he was at a playground with his son in Brooklyn, New York. In another incident 10 days later, it is alleged that a Yemeni-American Muslim woman was targeted on the New York subway by a man who called her a "terrorist", hit her and broke a Palestinian flag she was carrying. Ayah Zaki, a civil rights attorney for Cair in New Jersey, said that Palestinian mothers have recently been coming to her for advice on how to speak with their children about the issue."There's a fear-saturated conversation happening in households between the children who want to speak up about their identity, and moms who are absolutely terrified of them being in harm's way," Ms Zaki said. Ms Zaki said much of the racism Palestinians are facing is rooted in prejudices against Arabs and Muslims in the US that peaked after the attacks of 11 September 2001. She added the divisive political discourse in the US around the Israel-Gaza war is part of the problem.Abeer Ramadan-Shinnawi, an education consultant and mother based in Maryland, said that as a Palestinian born and raised in the US, she has often felt "othered" in American society - something that she said is also experienced by other minorities in the country. "There is no sense of acceptance," Ms Ramadan-Shinnawi said. But amid the fear and frustration is also resilience. A few days after the Burlington shootings, two vigils were held back-to-back in the city to honour the three young Palestinian men who were shot. One was held across from the hospital in which they were recovering, where a few people arrived wearing keffiyehs. And some like Ms Bornadaro have since been reflecting on the agonising conversations they have had with their children."I have decided to get myself a keffiyeh again," she told the BBC, a few weeks after the Burlington shooting had passed. "I used to wear one many years ago," she said, adding that she feels compelled to wear it again in solidarity.	
17/12/2023 00:51:00	Israel Gaza: The perils of hostage rescue - BBC News	The disastrous incident in which Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops shot dead three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Friday, mistaking them for Hamas fighters despite their waving a white cloth, is a graphic illustration of the risks involved in armed hostage rescue. Maj Gen Charlie Herbert, a retired British Army general who served on 13 operational tours including Iraq and Afghanistan, told the BBC: "As desperately sad as it is, the shooting dead of the three hostages... again calls into question IDF tactics, proportionality and distinction. One can only imagine how many civilians have been killed in similar circumstances." The IDF says it takes great care to avoid harming civilians, but the horrific death toll in Gaza - more than 18,000 and rising - has caused Israel to be accused of indiscriminate bombing. In nearly every case of kidnap in history, those abducted stand a far better chance of emerging alive and unscathed through mediation and a deal, rather than by armed intervention. One of the first hostage cases I covered was when Al-Qaeda-linked jihadists in Yemen abducted 16 Western tourists in 1998. The British ambassador went to see the interior minister to press for a negotiated release of the hostages. Too late, he was told, the Yemeni army has already gone in. A quarter of those kidnapped were killed in the ensuing firefight, with others injured.Western and Israeli special forces have spent decades perfecting the art of hostage rescue, but even then it doesn't always go to plan. Israel's Operation Thunderbolt in Entebbe, Uganda in 1976 rescued 102 of the 106 hostages, but the commander of the Israeli commandos was killed. Today his brother, Benjamin Netanyahu, is prime minister. The 1980 SAS siege of the Iranian embassy in London is perhaps the most iconic hostage rescue of modern times, as it took place in the full glare of the TV cameras. When a British journalist, Stephen Farrell, was kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2009 he was rescued by British Special Forces. But the raid also resulted in the deaths of one of his rescuers, two civilians and his Afghan interpreter. The following year a US Navy SEAL team attempted to rescue the British aid worker Linda Norgrove, also kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan. The raid killed her kidnappers but she died from a grenade thrown by one of her rescuers. In 2012 a British Special Forces operation to free one British and one Italian hostage in Nigeria was ruined when one of the Nigerian soldiers fired his weapon prematurely, alerting the kidnappers who then murdered their captives.Many hostage cases in Yemen have been resolved peacefully over the years, usually through lengthy tribal negotiations accompanied by interminable narcotic qat-chewing sessions. But ultimately, much depends on the demands and intentions of the kidnappers. In the case of Al-Qaeda in Iraq and the Islamic State group (IS), the jihadist kidnappers never really had any intention of releasing their US and British captives. Instead they were aiming for maximum psychological impact by killing them on camera. In those situations, armed intervention, if they can be located, is usually the only option available.Hamas is something of a hybrid case. The atrocities committed in their raid into southern Israel on 7 October were gratuitously cruel and violent. Yet they have subsequently been willing to bargain the release of more than 100 hostages. Today, Israel's hostage relatives are all too aware that nearly all those already released won their freedom not by daring military action but by painstaking negotiations and mediation by Qatar and Egypt, backed by the United States. To date, only one Israeli hostage, Private Ori Megedish, has been rescued by force.But doing a deal with kidnappers, especially those considered by many governments to be terrorists, can be a bitter pill to swallow. Hostage-takers will demand something in return. In the case of Hamas, that has meant releasing large numbers of prisoners from Israeli jails, pausing the fighting and significantly increasing the amount of aid getting into Gaza. Yet any further successful return of the hostages, says Gen Herbert, can only come about through diplomatic means: "There is no effective military solution to this issue in Gaza." 	
16/12/2023 21:09:00	Israel Gaza: Hostages were carrying white cloth when shot, IDF says - BBC News	Three Israeli hostages mistakenly killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza were shot dead while holding a white cloth, an Israeli military official says.The official said the case was "against our rules of engagement" and an investigation was happening at the "highest level".The hostages - Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 - were killed in Shejaiya on Friday.Israeli troops have been facing stiff resistance in the area near Gaza City.The case has added pressure on Israeli authorities to reach a deal for the release of the more than 120 captives who remain in Gaza.The wait of their families has gripped Israel, as the military carries out its offensive against Hamas.Speaking at a news conference, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there would be no let-up in the Israeli operations."Military pressure is necessary both for the return of the hostages and for victory. Without military pressure... we have nothing," he said.Hamas, for its part, said it had told mediators there would be no negotiations to release hostages "unless the aggression against our people stops once and for all".An Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an initial investigation by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) suggested the three hostages emerged shirtless from a building, with one carrying a stick with a white cloth.One of the soldiers, the official added, felt threatened, as the men were at a distance of tens of metres, declared them "terrorists" and opened fire. Two were immediately killed while the third, wounded, returned to the building.A cry for help was heard in Hebrew and the battalion commander ordered the troops to cease fire. The wounded hostage later re-emerged, and was shot and killed, the official said.The hostages had either been abandoned by their captors or escaped, the official added. A building with a message SOS was found in the area, and the authorities were investigating whether it was linked to the killed hostages.Meanwhile Wichian Temthong, a freed Thai hostage who was held with the three men, recalled his time with them, saying that, as they had no common language they used hand signals to communicate and give each other moral support. He was "very shocked" and "saddened" to learn of the deaths of the men he spent nearly 50 days in captivity with, he said.Since the end of a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas earlier this month, the families have urged the Israeli government to reach a new truce for at least some of the captives to be freed. The initial deal led to the release of more than 100 hostages, in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails.In Tel Aviv, thousands of people gathered outside the city's Museum of Art, in what is now known as Hostages Square, and called for a truce, chanting "Bring them home now"."It's our biggest fear what happened - hostages who were alive are now dead," Naama Weinberg, whose cousin Itai Svirsky is a hostage, said at the vigil. "We don't need bodies, or bags. Make a ceasefire until all hostages are back, alive. Every day that passes by we're just discovering more and more names of hostages that were taken alive and are now coming back dead."The war in Gaza, launched in response to the Hamas attacks that killed around 1,200 in Israel, has killed more than 18,000 people, according to the local health authorities, and pushed hundreds of thousands of others from their homes. Vast areas of the territory have been destroyed, and the United Nations has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe amid widespread shortages of basic supplies.Israeli authorities say the offensive's goal is to destroy Hamas and release the hostages.Amid mounting Palestinian civilian casualties, Israeli authorities have come under growing international pressure, including from the country's main ally, the US, but they have resisted calls for a ceasefire.Mr Netanyahu deflected the pressure again on Saturday. "Despite grief, despite international pressure, we continue until the end, nothing will stop us," he said.The BBC's Thanyarat Doksone in Bangkok contributed to this article	
16/12/2023 20:19:00	Samer Abudaqa: Al Jazeera cameraman killed in Gaza drone strike - BBC News	The funeral has been held of an Al Jazeera cameraman who was killed by an Israeli drone strike on Gaza.Samer Abudaqa was wounded in the strike on a school in Khan Younis on Friday along with his colleague, Wael Al-Dahdouh.Al Jazeera said Abudaqa bled to death because a heavy bombardment prevented paramedics from reaching him.The Qatar-based network said it had referred the case to the International Criminal Court (ICC).Posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, Al Jazeera referred to Abudaqa's death as an "assassination", and said that its legal filing to the ICC would include repeated attacks on network crews working in the Palestinian territories.The network said Abudaqa was its 13th journalist to die on duty since it was created in 1996.Dahdouh, who lost several family members in an earlier Israeli bombing, survived the attack.During his eulogy at this colleague's funeral, Dahdouh said journalists in Gaza would "continue to do our duty with professionalism and transparency".He said that journalists in Gaza were carrying a "human and noble message" for the world amid the ongoing war and would continue to work despite Israeli attacks.According to Al Jazeera, Dahdouh was hit by shrapnel on his upper arm and managed to walk to Nasser hospital for treatment.Abudaqa also suffered shrapnel injuries, but paramedics struggled reach him as the area was under heavy bombardment from Israeli forces.Al Jazeera said the cameraman was "left to bleed to death for over five hours," adding it held Israel accountable for targeting its journalists and their families.Abudaqa joined Al Jazeera in June 2004, working as a cameraman and editor. He had three sons and a daughter, and lived in the town of Abasan al-Kabira near Khan Younis.Al Jazeera's managing editor, Mohamed Moawad, described Abudaqa as "a skilled professional but a compassionate soul who understood the power of visual storytelling". "His unwavering commitment to truth and storytelling has left an indelible mark on our team," he said on X.According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 64 journalists - mostly Palestinians - have been killed since the Israel-Gaza conflict began on 7 October.The Foreign Press Association (FPA), which represents several hundred journalists working for international news organisations, said it grieved the cameraman's death. saying he was the first FPA member to be killed in the Israel-Gaza conflict."We consider this a grave blow to the already limited freedom of the press in Gaza and call on the army for a prompt investigation and explanation."	
16/12/2023 18:19:00	More big shipping firms stop Red Sea routes after attacks - BBC News	The world's largest shipping group, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), has announced it is diverting its ships away from the Red Sea because of an increased threat of attacks.French company CMA CGM took a similar step a day after Danish shipping giant Maersk and German transport company Hapag-Lloyd suspended Red Sea journeys.The decision comes after attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.They say they are targeting ships travelling to Israel.The Houthis have declared their support for Hamas after Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza following the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,200 people and saw 240 more taken hostage.Since then, Israel has killed more than 18,000 Palestinians in Gaza, Hamas health officials say.The Red Sea is one the world's most important routes for oil and fuel shipments.But the Houthis have been stepping up their attacks, using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels.They have also been firing drones and missiles towards Israel. The US said on Saturday its guided-missile destroyers had shot down 14 Houthi drones in the Red Sea. In its announcement, MSC said the situation in the area had become "serious".It said that its container ship MSC PALATIUM III was attacked on Friday as it was transiting the Red Sea. There were no injuries to the crew, but the ship had been taken out of service.Its ships were being re-routed via the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa.In its statement, CMA CGM - the world's third-largest shipping company - said it had instructed all its container ships there "to reach safe areas and pause their journey in safe waters with immediate effect until further notice". Maersk, the world's second-biggest shipping firm, has described the situation as "alarming"."Following the near-miss incident involving Maersk Gibraltar yesterday and yet another attack on a container vessel today, we have instructed all Maersk vessels in the area bound to pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait to pause their journey until further notice," it told the BBC on Friday.The four companies that have now suspended operations in the area comprise four of the top five in the world - and shipping experts say the decisions are going to be costly. "It's security to the crew, to the ship itself and also insurance policies. Premiums are now going sky high if they can get insurance at all, so it's going to have serious implications on stock levels, on costs and the whole dynamics of supply chains," Sue Terpilowski from the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, which represents companies concerned with supply chains, told the BBC.The added crewing, fuel and insurance costs are all likely to be passed on to consumers, says BBC business reporter Vivienne Nunis. The Bab al-Mandab strait - also known as the Gate of Tears - is a channel 20 miles (32km) wide, and known for being perilous to navigate.It sits between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula and Djibouti and Eritrea on the African coast.It is the route by which ships can reach the Suez Canal from the south - itself a major shipping lane. Avoiding it means vessels must take much longer routes, for example navigating around southern Africa.About 17,000 ships and 10% of global trade pass through it every year. Any ship passing through Suez to or from the Indian Ocean has to come this way.	
16/12/2023 15:56:00	HMS Diamond: British warship shoots down suspected attack drone in Red Sea - BBC News	A British warship has shot down a suspected attack drone in the Red Sea, the defence secretary has said.HMS Diamond, a Type 45 Destroyer, successfully destroyed the target on Saturday, Grant Shapps said.The Ministry of Defence said it was the first time in decades the Royal Navy had shot an aerial target in anger.The MoD did not say who was behind the incident, but Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for recent attacks in the Red Sea.The Houthis have targeted foreign ships in the area since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. They have declared support for Hamas and have said they were targeting ships travelling to Israel. Merchant shipping was believed to be the drone's intended target in Saturday's incident, the defence secretary said.The Red Sea lies between north Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and connects the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean via the Suez Canal.HMS Diamond was sent to the region just two weeks ago "to bolster international efforts to maintain maritime security", Mr Shapps said in a statement.The defence secretary said the attacks represented "a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security" in the Red Sea. "The UK remains committed to repelling these attacks to protect the free flow of global trade," he added.Earlier this month, the US military said the Unity Explorer, sailing under the flag of the Bahamas and owned by a British company, was among three commercial vessels targeted in an attack by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.On Friday, shipping company Maersk told all its vessels planning to pass through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait in the Red Sea to "pause their journey until further notice" after a missile attack on a Liberian-flagged cargo ship.About 50 large merchant ships pass through the strait every day while double that number pass through the Strait of Hormuz.According to the MoD, the last time the Royal Navy shot down an aerial target in anger was in the First Gulf War in 1991, when Type 42 Destroyer HMS Gloucester destroyed an Iraqi Silkworm missile bound for a US warship.First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Ben Key said: "One sixth of the world's commercial shipping passes through the Bab-al-Mandeb Strait and Red Sea. "HMS Diamond deployed at short notice to the region from Portsmouth just two weeks ago and is already delivering effect together with our American, French and other allies and partners."The Royal Navy is committed to upholding the right to free use of the oceans and we do not tolerate indiscriminate threats or attacks against those going about their lawful business on the high seas."	
16/12/2023 11:57:00	Kuwaiti leader Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmed dies aged 86 - BBC News	Kuwait's leader Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah has died at the age of 86, Kuwaiti state TV announced.The sheikh had led the oil-rich nation for the last three years after taking over from his half brother, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah.The crown prince, 83-year-old Sheikh Mishal al-Ahmad al-Sabah, has been named as his successor.Kuwait has announced 40 days of mourning and government offices are to close for three days."With great sadness and sorrow, we mourn... the death of Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah" a statement aired on state TV said.Sheikh Nawaf was named crown prince in 2006 and took over as emir in 2020. Born in 1937, he was the fifth son of Kuwait's former ruler Sheikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah.He was defence minister when Iraq invaded and occupied Kuwait in 1990, sparking the beginning of the Gulf War, and later went onto serve as interior minister. Compared to his predecessor, who served as emir for more than a decade and shaped the country's foreign policy for 50 years, Sheikh Nawaf's time as ruler was relatively short. Kuwait - which has a population of 4.8 million, including 3.4 million foreign workers - has the world's sixth-largest known oil reserves and is a major US ally.The emirate's parliament has the most powers of any elected body in the Gulf and opposition MPs openly criticise the Sabahs.However, the ruling family retains full control over key government and executive posts and the emir has the last say in political matters. He also has the power to override or dissolve parliament, and call elections.Regular programming on TV channels has been cut following the announcement.

16/12/2023 01:02:00	Israel hostages: IDF says it mistakenly killed three men held in Gaza - BBC News	The Israeli military says it has mistakenly killed three hostages during its campaign in Gaza after they were mis-identified as a "threat".  They were named as Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26.The military shared its remorse and said the three were shot by troops operating in Shejaiya, in Gaza's north. More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza after being captured in the 7 October attacks on Israel.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Friday's incident was under investigation, and that it "expresses deep remorse over the tragic incident and sends the families its heartfelt condolences"."Our national mission is to locate the missing and return all the hostages home," it added.Hundreds of people gathered in central Tel Aviv following the announcement and marched to an IDF military base in the city, calling on the government to secure a deal for the release of the remaining hostages. Demonstrators held candles and carried placards that read "Bring [them] home" and "Hostage exchange now!"The bodies of the three men have been returned to Israeli territory, where checks confirmed their identities.Yotam Haim, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on 7 October, was a musician who loved animals and cooking Italian food.On the morning of the Hamas attack, he called his family and told them that his house was on fire. When he opened the window for some fresh air, Yotam was kidnapped by Hamas.Speaking to the BBC before her son's death, his mother said they had messaged each other as they hid in their home shelters - before their connection was lost.Alon Shamriz was also at Kfar Aza at the time of the attack. His family gave permission for him to be named after asking earlier that his identity not be revealed.Samer Talalka, a Bedouin, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Am. An avid motorcycle enthusiast, he loved to travel in the countryside and spend time with friends. He lived in the town of Hura and worked at a chicken hatchery in the kibbutz. On the morning of 7 October, he was at work. He called his sister after the attack to tell her that he had been injured by gunfire.His father told local media they lost touch at 07:00 local time on the morning of the attacks. A photograph of him being led through Gaza was shared on Telegram.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called their deaths an "unbearable tragedy"."Even on this difficult evening, we will bind up our wounds, learn the lessons and continue with a supreme effort to return all our abductees home safely," he said.White House spokesperson John Kirby said the killings were a "tragic mistake," and that the US did not have "perfect visibility on exactly how this operation unfolded".More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza after being captured on 7 October when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages - some of whom were released during a brief truce.The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 18,800 people have been killed and 50,000 injured in the enclave so far in the war that followed. Hen Avigdori, whose wife and daughter were among the released, said he often heard people say hostages could be rescued "by military means."But "there is no military way" that would bring them back safely, he wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. "The conclusion for every person who has both heart and mind is the same: Israel must initiate a deal to bring them back alive and not in coffins."	
16/12/2023 00:21:00	Lucy Williamson: Hamas support soars in West Bank - but full uprising can still be avoided - BBC News	There was speculation over whether another uprising was brewing in the West Bank, even before the Hamas attacks on Israel in October.Frequent raids by the Israeli army, emboldened by a hard-right Israeli government - following deadly attacks by Palestinians, and violent attacks on Palestinians by settlers - had already increased pressure on Palestinians there.Since the war in Gaza, those pressures have spiralled: Israeli raids into West Bank towns have become more frequent and more forceful, and many families are suffering economically after Israel withheld tax revenues used to pay public servants in the West Bank, and banned Palestinian workers from entering Israel too.There is anger at almost 20,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, and support for Hamas is rising.But despite all this, calls by the armed group for an uprising in the West Bank over the past couple of months have come and gone.Support for Hamas - and armed resistance more generally - has risen sharply since the war in Gaza began.  An opinion poll by the Centre for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah found that support for Hamas in the West Bank had more than tripled. Meanwhile, support for the West Bank's ruling party, Fatah, had dropped significantly. More than 90% of respondents thought Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas should resign.But it seems that support for armed resistance, and disillusion with politics, is not translating into action on the ground.Since the war began, weekly demonstrations have been held in West Bank cities. The slogans chanted there are against Israel - but also against the Palestinian Authority. But they're usually held in city centres where there is much less risk of confrontation with Israeli soldiers, rather than at checkpoints - as happened during the last Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s.And the numbers turning out for these weekly demonstrations are smaller than they were during previous moments of tension.  "People hesitate to come when Hamas calls for demonstrations, because there is a clear security price to be paid from the Israeli response," said Raed Debiy, a political scientist and youth leader in Fatah.But they also don't come when Fatah calls for them, Debiy says, because "people have lost hope in political parties".As the actions of Israel's army in the West Bank have become harsher, and the Palestinian security services more efficient, many people fear that becoming an active member of a militant group could make them a target for arrest or assassination.More than 270 people have been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October - including 70 children - according to the UN.  That's more than half the total number killed this year.Four Israelis - including three from the armed forces - have been killed by Palestinians there in the same period.An operation to arrest Palestinian gunmen in the Jenin refugee camp this week lasted several days, with frequent bursts of heavy gunfire, rocket attacks and air strikes. Hundreds of people were detained, with 60 of them handed over to the security services for further questioning.The Israeli army has also been trying to destroy infrastructure used by armed groups.This time, it claimed to have found more than a dozen underground tunnel shafts in the camp, as well as facilities for making explosives and "observation control rooms" to monitor Israeli forces.One young man from the camp, who was among those detained this week and released after questioning, said the reason people ignored calls by Hamas to rise up in solidarity was that the group did not supply the West Bank with enough equipment to fight the Israeli army."Hamas in the West Bank has not done a good job of organising itself over the last decade," said Khalil Shikaki, head of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah.  "The Israelis have been arresting a lot of their members. Hamas is just incapable right now in the West Bank of mobilising and organising an eruption of violence that would be sustainable."But previous uprisings here did not rely on Hamas. The second intifada (uprising), which began in 2000, was led by members of the West Bank's ruling party, Fatah. The current leader of Fatah, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, is widely seen as trying to avoid an escalation in violence against Israel - a major shift in position from his predecessor, Yasser Arafat.His security services co-operate with Israel to arrest members of armed groups - something that is widely criticised by Palestinians.Sabri Saidam, a member of Fatah's Central Committee, denies that the party's position is at odds with public feeling in the territory, or that the Palestinian Authority (PA) is somehow avoiding a fight."To say that Fatah is in control and keeping the calm, [it's] as if you are hinting that there is a forceful implementation of a state of calm," he said. "Nobody is forcing anything on anyone.""People in the West Bank know that Netanyahu is throwing down bait, through persistent attacks every night against the people of Palestine regardless of their political affiliation - because he wants to provoke the Palestinians into a confrontational mood that he will use as an excuse to escalate the situation."The US is pushing Israel to allow a "revitalised" PA to govern Gaza once the war there ends. Israel has so far said it will not consider it.  But the chance to govern a unified Palestinian bloc for the first time since 2006 is another incentive for the Fatah-dominated PA to prove its credentials and stop the situation in the West Bank from spiralling out of control. "It's very clear that Fatah don't want any intifada," explained Raed Debiy, the party youth leader. "They are still very keen to keep the status quo. But the grassroots of Fatah will not be controlled forever. How can you stay silent under daily assassination, daily invasion, daily violation of settlers - this will definitely lead to explosion."In 2000, the spark for the second intifada was a visit by then-Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon to a contested holy site in Jerusalem, known to Muslims as the al-Aqsa compound and to Jews at the Temple Mount.Sharon's visit happened amid smouldering Palestinian frustration at the failure of the Oslo peace process - and, Dr Shikaki says, was "exploited" by Fatah's young guard to launch the uprising.A small event like this could still trigger something significant, but the situation has shifted since 2000.  Now, far-right ministers in the Israeli government visit the compound, and make inflammatory claims about Israeli control of the site, without triggering a major response - at least not in the West Bank."We told the American administration many times that the pressure would definitely lead to some sort of reaction," said the senior Fatah leader, Sabri Saidam.  "But no-one anticipated that the reaction would come from Gaza."Where the West Bank goes from here depends partly on what follows the war in Gaza. That transition is likely to be a precarious time for the West Bank, with hopes of a unified Palestinian leadership - possibly opening the door to talks on a future Palestinian state - clashing with the opposition of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.And lifting restrictions imposed by Israel after the attacks - separating Palestinian and settler vehicles on some roads, for example - could prompt a spike in friction.But a sustained uprising, of the kind seen two decades ago, will likely require a change in the policy of the West Bank's main political movement - and possibly even a change in its leader."It seems Fatah remains critical for an uprising to happen," Dr Shikaki told me. "And as long as Fatah and the security services are not directly involved in the preparation for such an intifada, it seems highly unlikely we'll see one emerging."I don't yet see Fatah or the security services on the verge of a turning point," he continued. "But we're moving in that direction."Others point to the dwindling faith in Palestinian politics to provide peace, a state, or just a better life."If we had anything on the political agenda, things could go quiet," Raed Debiy told me. "But I'm not sure with this right-wing [Israeli] government whether there is anything solid on the table - so the only scenario I see is explosion.  It's just a matter of time."

Avoiding it means vessels must take much longer routes, for example navigating around southern Africa.About 17,000 ships and 10% of global trade pass through it every year. Any ship passing through Suez to or from the Indian Ocean has to come this way.Maersk pausing its Red Sea shipping journeys "could not come at a more difficult time", director general at the Institute of Export & International Trade Marco Forgione said."This impacts every link in the supply chain... and will only increase the chances of critical products not making their destinations in time for Christmas," he added.At least two other cargo ships in the strait came under attack on Friday. The US says one was hit with a drone and another by missiles, blaming the Houthis for both attacks.The Houthis did not confirm the drone strike, but said they did fire missiles at two boats.The group has controlled parts of Yemen since seizing power from the country's government in 2014, triggering an ongoing civil war.Speaking before the announcements by Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan - who is on a trip to the Middle East - said the Houthis were threatening freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, which is vital for oil and goods shipments."The United States is working with the international community, with partners from the region and from all over the world to deal with this threat," he said.Earlier this month, a US warship shot down three drones fired from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen after three commercial vessels came under attack in the Red Sea.Just days before that incident, the US said another warship had captured armed men who had earlier seized an Israeli-linked tanker off Yemen's coast.Last month, the Houthis released video footage showing armed men dropping from a helicopter and seizing a cargo ship in the southern Red Sea.	
15/12/2023 23:00:00	Lockerbie bombing: The ultimate detective story? - BBC News	Thirty-five years ago this week the deadliest terror attack in British history took place when Pan Am flight 103 from London to New York exploded over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.In a prison cell in the United States, 72-year-old Abu Agila Masud is waiting to stand trial, accused of making the bomb that destroyed the US airliner.The prospect of the Libyan's trial has been accompanied by a renewed surge of interest in the events of 21 December 1988.At its heart lies an atrocity which killed 270 men, women and children from 21 countries. Entire families died on the plane and on the ground.An account of the investigation that followed reads like the ultimate true crime detective story. Everyone on board Pan Am flight 103 that night was killed - 259 passengers and crew. The oldest was 82 while the youngest was a two-month-old baby.Two thirds of the victims were Americans. It was the worst terror attack on the US until 9/11.Another 11 people perished when the wreckage fell on their homes in Lockerbie. In total, 44 UK citizens were killed. It remains the worst act of mass murder in British legal history.There will always be competing theories about who was responsible but only one version of events has been accepted by a court of law and upheld on appeal.In 2001, a Scottish court sitting in the neutral Netherlands ruled it was an act of state-sponsored terrorism carried out by the Libyan intelligence service.Three judges decided Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was part of the plot and convicted him of playing a central role in the bombing.He became known as "the Lockerbie bomber" but he was always accused of acting along with other Libyan conspirators, including Abu Agila Masud, the man now facing trial in the US.The case put before that court more than 20 years ago followed an international investigation that extended to 70 countries.Almost every piece of key evidence has been debated and disputed, to the exasperation of the Scots and Americans who investigated Lockerbie.Responding to accusations that Libya and Megrahi were framed, a former chief constable of Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary once declared: "You couldn't make this up. How on earth can you set up a chain of evidence like that? It's nonsense."The story of that chain of evidence starts in the streets of Lockerbie and the surrounding countryside.The Boeing 747 Clipper Maid of the Seas broke up at 31,000 feet as it flew from Heathrow to New York, four days before Christmas.Approximately 319 tons of wreckage were scattered over 845 square miles - the largest crime scene in history. A town that would normally have four police officers on duty found itself at the centre of a massive recovery operation and investigation.By the morning of 22 December, about 1,100 police officers were involved, along with 1,000 personnel from the military, emergency services, local authorities and voluntary groups.In the weeks that followed, a painstaking search recovered wreckage as far away as the coast of Northumberland on the other side of the country.Investigators found signs of an explosion on one of the baggage containers from the forward hold.Scottish police and FBI agents established the bomb had been concealed in a Toshiba radio cassette player in a Samsonsite suitcase.Initially, suspicion fell on Iran and a Syrian-backed Palestinian militant group.On 3 July 1988, a US Navy cruiser USS Vincennes had mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner over the Gulf, killing all 290 men, women and children on board. Iran swore revenge.Three months before the Lockerbie bombing, in an operation titled Autumn Leaves, West German police had raided flats in Frankfurt and arrested members of the Syrian-backed Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC).The group had been preparing bombs in radio cassette players. By December 1988, most had been released.The feeder flight for Pan Am 103, Pan Am 103a, had left from Frankfurt.Months were spent investigating the PFLP-GC group but the search for evidence then took the inquiry in a different direction - to an island in the Mediterranean.A babygro from the suitcase containing the bomb had been made in Malta. Another charred fragment from a pair of trousers bore a Yorkie label. With the input of the FBI, the inquiry traced the Yorkie brand to a Maltese clothes manufacturer.Scottish detectives visited the firm and were told Yorkie trousers had been sold to a small shop in a side street in Sliema.The officers listened in astonishment when the owner of Mary's House recalled selling Yorkie trousers to a man in the weeks before the Lockerbie bombing.It was an unusually lucrative piece of business Tony Gauci remembered well, even though it had happened nine months before.He said the customer had bought a seemingly random collection of clothes and an umbrella.Mr Gauci was certain he was Libyan and in February 1991, shown a photograph of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi supplied by the Czech intelligence service, he said it looked similar to the man who'd come into his shop.His identification of Megrahi was never absolute but records showed the Libyan was on Malta on the date Mr Gauci was alleged to have sold him the clothes.All of this was vigorously disputed at Megrahi's trial and has been ever since, but to this day that cornerstone of the prosecution case remains in place.In January 1989, detectives searching near the countryside 30 miles from Lockerbie had found another scrap of cloth.Embedded in the charred neckband of a shirt was a fragment of a green-coloured circuit board.With the help of the CIA, the FBI matched it to MST-13 bomb timers which had been seized in the African country of Togo.Then with the assistance of German police and the authorities in Switzerland, the trail led to a company called Mebo.The first interviews with the company revealed it had sold MST-13 timers to Libya. One of its owners, Edwin Bollier, knew Megrahi, who had an office next to his in Zurich.Back in Malta, an exhaustive search of immigration records established Megrahi had arrived on the island from Libya on 20 December 1988, the day before the bombing, using a false passport supplied by the Libyan intelligence service. He travelled back to Libya on the 21st, accompanied, it was alleged, by the suspect now in that American jail - Abu Agila Masud.In November 1991, Scottish and American prosecutors announced charges which alleged that Megrahi and another Libyan, Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, were members of their country's intelligence service.Megrahi had been head of security at Libyan Arab Airlines. Fhimah was the former station manager for Libyan Arab Airlines at Luqa Airport on Malta.They were accused of placing the suitcase containing the bomb into the luggage system at Luqa for a flight from Malta to Frankfurt.Computer records printed off by a baggage handler at Frankfurt Airport after the bombing showed an unaccompanied suitcase had arrived on a flight from Malta and was loaded onto the feeder flight, Pan Am 103a. The prosecution case was that it was transferred onto board Pan Am 103 at Heathrow.Interviewed in Libya, Megrahi and Fhimah protested their innocence. Megrahi said he hadn't been in Malta on the day of the bombing but the fake passport proved otherwise.Libya's leader Colonel Gaddafi refused to hand the men over.Years of deadlock and sanctions followed, until the involvement of Nelson Mandela and a UN-brokered deal led to a trial in a Scottish court at Camp Zeist, a former US airbase in the Netherlands.After 84 days of evidence, Fhimah was cleared. Megrahi was convicted of mass murder, lost his first appeal and was flown to Scotland to serve a life sentence.Many relatives of the American victims were furious that Colonel Gaddafi had not been in the dock with the pair.But some relatives of the British victims, led by the English GP Dr Jim Swire, believed and still believe that Megrahi was innocent, and the real culprits were Iran and the Palestinians.In 2003, lawyers acting for the victims announced they had reached agreement with Libya over a £1.7bn compensation fund. Libya accepted responsibility for the actions of its officials, although years later Colonel Gaddafi's son claimed it had only done so for sanctions to be lifted.In 2007, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission referred the case back to the appeal court.It said it had found nothing to suggest evidence had been tampered with - a longstanding accusation from Megrahi's supporters - but believed he might have been the victim of a miscarriage of justice, principally over Tony Gauci's identification of him as the man who bought the clothes for the suitcase that held the bomb.The case was slowly working its way through the courts when Megrahi was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2008.He abandoned his second appeal in 2009 and was released on compassionate grounds by the Scottish government after doctors advised he had three months to live.The decision was supported by Dr Swire and some of the other British relatives, but it is still the cause of great bitterness among many relatives of the American victims.Megrahi outlived Colonel Gaddafi, who was killed after an uprising toppled his regime in 2011. The man called the Lockerbie bomber died in 2012, three years after his release.Gaddafi's demise gave investigators fresh hope that new light could be shed on Lockerbie. Contact was made with the new Libyan authorities and Scottish and American investigators and prosecutors travelled to North Africa to meet them.In 2015, Scotland's Crown Office and the US Attorney General announced they had evidence to treat two Libyans as suspects and were requesting permission from Libya to interview them.The suspects were Abu Agila Masud and Gaddafi's former intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi, who had picked up Megrahi at the airport in Tripoli when he arrived home from Scotland six years before.What appeared to be a major development was derailed when Libya descended into civil war but lines of communication with Libyan officials were maintained despite the bloodshed and chaos.In 2017, five years after his death, Megrahi's family lodged a new bid to clear his name.It was being considered when Scotland's national police force announced the results of Operation Sandwood - an investigation into allegations from Megrahi's supporters.Police Scotland said they had found no evidence of criminality in relation to the handling of the investigation and prosecution of the case.What they had found was new information which they passed to the Crown Office and the Scottish Criminal Case Review Commission which was looking at the case a second time.In 2020, the commission sent Megrahi's conviction back to the appeal court, having concluded that: "No reasonable trial court, relying on the evidence led at trial, could have held the case against Mr Megrahi was proved beyond reasonable doubt."As ever with Lockerbie, it wasn't that simple.The commission also said it had obtained new information which, if believed, pointed at Libya and Megrahi as being responsible for bombing Pan Am 103.On the 32nd anniversary of the bombing, the US announced charges against Abu Agila Masud, who was serving a jail sentence in Libya for targeting anti-Gaddafi forces back in 2011.The FBI criminal complaint said Masud had confessed to making the bomb that brought down Pan Am 103, and had acted in concert with Megrahi and Fhimah, the Libyan cleared at Camp Zeist.The Americans alleged Masud was an ex-Libyan intelligence operative and had admitted carrying out the attack on the orders of Colonel Gaddafi, who, he said, congratulated him afterwards.Masud was also said to have admitted making the bomb used in an attack on a disco in Berlin in 1986.American and Scottish investigators believe that was the incident that triggered the whole terrible cycle of retribution and revenge that led to Lockerbie.Libya and the US were at loggerheads in the 1970s and 80s. The bombing at the La Belle disco killed two US servicemen and a Turkish woman, and injured another 229 people, 79 of them American.The then US president Ronald Reagan said Libya was responsible and 10 days later, the US air force bombed the Libyan capital Tripoli and the city of Benghazi.Widely seen as an attempt to assassinate Colonel Gaddafi, who survived, the operation killed his adopted baby daughter along with at least 15 civilians.The bombing of Libya after the bombing of the disco has been put forward as the motive for the bombing of Pan Am 103.Another theory is that Libya took on the "task" of avenging the shooting down of the Iranian airliner after the Palestinian cell was discovered in West Germany.A month after the charges against Masud had been made public, Scottish judges rejected Megrahi's posthumous appeal and upheld the verdict delivered at Camp Zeist 20 years earlier. In December 2022, a few weeks before the 34th anniversary of the bombing, came the news that Masud had been handed over to American custody.The exact circumstances have not yet been explained but the head of Scotland's prosecution service has said the process was lawful.Masud's family claimed he had been dragged from his sick bed by armed militia and was a religious man who wouldn't kill anyone.Named in court papers as Abu Agila Mohammad Mas'ud Kheir Al-Marimi, the Libyan has pled not guilty to two counts of destruction of an aircraft resulting in death and a count of destruction of a vehicle resulting in death. Assuming his trial goes ahead, the case built by Scottish and American investigators over decades will be put before a jury in a US federal court.The provenance of the alleged confession is sure to be contested by the defence.Will the trial happen? Masud is a long way from home and facing the possibility of ending his days in a foreign jail.If he does know what happened at Lockerbie, would it be in his interests to co-operate with the US authorities?As for Gaddafi's former spy chief, Abdullah Senussi, he's still alive in Libya.The prospect of him ever standing trial over Lockerbie seems far-fetched, but this case has a long history of unexpected twists and turns.Thirty-five years on, there are more chapters in this story to come.	
15/12/2023 21:11:00	Israel-Gaza war: UN aid worker describes nightmare journey to al-Ahli Hospital - BBC News	The "dehumanising" treatment of paramedics, ambulances shot at, and unexploded bombs on the road.Jake Morland, a British aid worker with the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), has given the BBC his eyewitness account of a high-risk mission to transfer patients under appalling conditions in Gaza.Last Saturday, 9 December, a joint World Health Organisation (WHO)/UN/Palestine Red Crescent Society convoy of six ambulances and a truck set off from southern Gaza to deliver desperately-needed medical supplies to the al-Ahli Hospital in the north, and to transfer critically-injured patients from there to a hospital in the south.To get to al-Ahli, the convoy had to pass through the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) checkpoint at Wadi Gaza."The one thing we expect when we go through a checkpoint in any military setting is free access for humanitarian personnel and goods", says Mr Morland, who has been a UN aid worker for 20 years.But this time, he says, "we approached huge sand dunes with Israeli soldiers standing on the top with their machine guns squarely aimed at the Palestinian paramedics, at the UN vehicles, and at the UN trucks carrying medical supplies".As they were held there for over an hour, two of the Palestinian paramedics were led away for questioning. "We understand one was put on his knees, stripped and detained for some time until we were able to negotiate his release and carry on to Gaza," says Mr Morland."These moves (of aid) are clearly co-ordinated with the IDF," he says. "We provide all the details of what's on the convoy, what it's going to do, and indeed the names of all the members of the convoy… So what was really a dehumanising treatment of Palestinian colleagues was unacceptable."From Wadi Gaza, the aid convoy pressed on north into the old city of Gaza, which Mr Morland describes as a rabbit warren of debris-strewn streets - with unexploded ordnance on the road and beside it."We were also shot at. The ambulance took a couple of bullets as indeed did a truck. So it really was putting humanitarian workers' lives on the line as they went to try and save lives."On the return journey south, they were again held up at the checkpoint - but this time they were carrying 19 critically injured patients from a tiny trauma hospital in Gaza City, so every minute counted."All of these patients had life-critical injuries - amputations; horrific wounds that needed immediate attention. We were held for over two hours at the checkpoint. The walking wounded were forced at gunpoint from the ambulance and again were stood in the sand to be profiled by the IDF," Mr Morland recalls. "Even the children who were wounded and terrified were carried out by the paramedics, and stood there for over an hour while pictures were taken." Eventually, as night fell and the sound of air strikes grew closer, the group had to take a difficult decision: to leave behind one of the paramedics who was still detained by the IDF. "We had patients who were literally dying because of all the delays that were being imposed on us," says Mr Morland."I heard that one of the patients died from his injuries on the way to a hospital in the south. We think that may have been avoidable if we'd been allowed free and fair access through the checkpoint." We put these allegations to the IDF, who told us that one of the Palestinian paramedics was detained because he was suspected of "association with terror activities".The IDF said they encouraged the rest of the convoy to move on south, but that of the six ambulances containing injured patients, three opted to remain with the suspect despite being encouraged to move to the southern hospital. Regarding the patient who reportedly died, the IDF said this was only reported to them days later and they have yet to be able to independently confirm it.For Jake Morland though, it was not just the hardship of getting a medical convoy through IDF lines that shocked him - it was what he witnessed in Gaza's al-Ahli Hospital that day."This is a hospital that normally treats 80 patients with 80 beds," he says. "There are currently over 200 patients in that hospital."They're no longer dealing with broken bones. They're now dealing with life-threatening wounds; horrific, shrapnel wounds. "I've never seen so many people dying in front of me. They were lying on stretchers with horrific wounds next to body bags. The scenes were horrific. And yet these Palestinian paramedics and the other aid workers that go there (to northern Gaza) time and time again - at great risk to themselves - act with compassion and dignity, and help these patients, and try to bring them to safety". Asked what the wounds were caused by, Mr Morland says: "They are just praying for the bombs to stop raining down on them in Gaza City, and they are all wounds and injuries of war. Pure and simple."On Wednesday, the WHO put out its own statement, calling for healthcare and humanitarian aid workers to be protected.	
15/12/2023 16:12:00	Yemen Houthi rebels claim attacks on two Red Sea cargo ships - BBC News	Two cargo ships in the Red Sea have been attacked by missiles fired from territory in Yemen, the US says.One was hit with a drone and another by missiles, both launched from a part of Yemen controlled by the Houthis - a rebel movement backed by Iran.The Houthis did not confirm the drone strike, but said they did fire missiles at the second boat - and a third one.  It is the latest attack on foreign ships in the area since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. The Houthis - who seized power nine years ago - have declared their support for Hamas and say they are targeting ships travelling to Israel.The vessels came under attack in the Bab El Mandab - a narrow strait of water that is vital for global trade.Referring to the alleged drone attack, a US defence official told AFP news agency on Friday: "We are aware that something launched from a Houthi-controlled region of Yemen struck this vessel which was damaged, and there was a report of a fire."That container ship, called the Al Jasrah, is owned by German transport company Hapag-Lloyd, and flagged to Liberia in West Africa. A Hapag-Lloyd spokesman told AFP that the ship was on its way to Singapore from the Greek port of Piraeus. There were no casualties and the ship is now continuing towards its destination, he added.The Houthis gave no acknowledgement of a hit on the Al Jasrah, but said they had targeted the MSC Palatium and MSC Alanya with missiles.Giving their own account of a missile strike on a vessel - which they did not name - a US defence official said the hit caused a fire and a US Navy destroyer was on its way to put it out.The US is under pressure from Israel to do something about these attacks but Washington is reluctant to target the Houthi missile sites for fear of widening the Israel-Hamas conflict and triggering retaliation by Iran.Instead, it is more likely there would be a multinational naval coalition forming to protect shipping and shoot down any incoming missiles and drones.US national security adviser Jake Sullivan - who is on a trip to the Middle East - said the Houthis were a "material threat" to shipping and commerce in the region.He said Iran bore ultimate responsibility for the attacks, adding: "While the Houthis are pulling the trigger, so to speak, they're being handed the gun by Iran."Iran has a responsibility to take steps themselves to cease these attacks, because these attacks, as I said before, are a fundamental threat to international law and international peace and security."More incidents were also reported in the region on Friday - including a separate report elsewhere that another ship had been hijacked.The UK's maritime trade operations agency said it had received a report that a crew of a ship further east in the Arabian Sea was no longer in control of a vessel, and it was heading towards Somalia."At present all crew are reported as safe" the UKMTO said.The latest attacks follow several earlier ones in the southern Red Sea, pushing up insurance premiums and potentially making some ships go all the way round Cape of Good Hope in South Africa to avoid the Red Sea. The Houthis - who are fighting Yemen's Saudi-backed government - have declared themselves part of an "axis of resistance" of Iran-affiliated groups opposing Israel, the US, and the wider West.They have already attacked several commercial ships this month, prompting a US destroyer to intervene, and in November they successfully hijacked a cargo ship.US, French and British warships have been patrolling the Red Sea area and have shot several missiles out of the sky.The Bab El Mandeb Strait is a 20-mile wide channel that separates Eritrea and Djibouti on the African side from Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula.About 17,000 ships and 10% of global trade pass through it every year. Any ship passing through the Suez Canal to or from the Indian Ocean has to come this way.	
15/12/2023 09:28:00	British-Palestinians call for visa scheme for trapped relatives - BBC News	British-Palestinian families have urged the government to create a visa scheme for stranded relatives in Gaza.A letter, sent to Foreign Secretary David Cameron on behalf of 80 families, calls for a scheme similar to the Ukraine Family Scheme visa.A petition on Parliament's website calling for a new visa scheme also has more than 22,700 signatures.The government said it was "working around the clock" to get those "who want to leave" out of Gaza.More than 270 British nationals and their dependants have left Gaza so far, it added in a statement to the BBC. British nationals currently need to apply for visas for their spouses, partners and children who are in Gaza through the existing family visa route, before they come to the UK. British children under the age of 18 can also sponsor their parents for a visa. This visa route carries fees - someone outside the UK wanting to join their British spouse, for example, generally needs to pay £1,840. There is also a health surcharge to pay on top of that, which is at least £1,560 for adults. Relatives such as siblings, parents of adult children and extended family, are not eligible in most cases.The Ukraine Family Scheme was set up in March 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, to allow people fleeing the war in Ukraine to move to the UK to join family members. This can be either an immediate or extended family member, including a parent of an adult child. It is free to apply to the Ukraine Family Scheme, and additional fees such as the health surcharge are waived. About 71,400 visas have been issued under the scheme so far. The letter, co-written and signed by British citizens and residents with family members in Gaza, calls for an equivalent scheme to be set up for Palestinians."While acknowledging the complexities of each conflict, it is disheartening for us, as British citizens and UK residents, to witness the disparity in our government response," it said.Not having a specific visa scheme for Palestinians, the letter said, "stands in stark contrast to the swift and supportive actions taken in similar circumstances, such as in the Ukrainian conflict".Palestinians in the UK "are currently feeling a profound sense of abandonment and neglect" as a result, it said.One of the people who signed the letter, Ibrahim Assaliya, told BBC News that his 71-year-old mother is trapped alone in Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza."It's a horrible situation," he said. "The shelling and bombardment... she's been asked two times to leave her house to go to another place. But she can't do it, because she's disabled."He added that "it's miserable there - there's no food, no water. They're starving".Dr Assaliya, his wife and five children - all British nationals - were visiting his mother in Gaza when the war broke out. They were eventually able to evacuate through the Rafah crossing last month, but this meant leaving Dr Assaliya's mother behind. In a statement sent to the BBC, the government said: "We are working at pace to support British families who have crossed the border into Egypt, making sure any dependants who need a visa can apply for one and that appropriate checks are carried out in a timely manner."	
15/12/2023 06:00:00	How Israel jails hundreds of Palestinians without charge - BBC News	In a family home in Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank, Yazen Alhasnat was sitting next to his mother rubbing sleep from his eyes.  The 17-year-old had been released from prison the night before, nearly five months after being arrested in a 4am Israeli military raid on the home.  Yazen had been held under "administrative detention" - a longstanding security policy, inherited from the British, that allows the Israeli state to imprison people indefinitely without charge, and without presenting any evidence against them. "They have a secret file," Yazen said. "They don't tell you what's in it." He was back at home because he was among the 180 Palestinian children and women released from prison by Israel in the recent exchange for hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.  But at the same time the Palestinian prisoners were being released, Israel was detaining people at its highest rate in years. In the weeks since 7 October, the number of people in administrative detention - already at a 30-year high of 1,300 - has shot up to more than 2,800. When Yazen was released, his family was told not to publicly celebrate in any way or to talk to the media. The same instructions were given to the families of two other teenagers who spoke to the BBC about their experiences. But all three families said they wanted to highlight the issue of administrative detention. Israel says that its use of the policy is compliant with international law and a necessary preventative measure to combat terrorism. Maurice Hirsch, a former director of military prosecutions for the West Bank, from 2013 to 2016, told the BBC that Israel was "not only meeting international law but far surpassing it", by allowing detainees to appeal and ensuring that their detentions were reviewed every six months.But human rights groups say Israel's expansive use of the measure is an abuse of a security law not designed to be employed at such scale, and that detainees cannot effectively defend themselves, or appeal, because they have no access to the evidence against them."Under international law, administrative detention should be a rare exception," said Jessica Montell, the executive director of HaMoked, an Israeli human rights organisation that monitors detention of Palestinians.  "You are supposed to use it when there is a present danger and no other way to prevent that danger than detaining someone. But it is clear Israel is not using it that way. It is detaining hundreds, thousands of people, without charge, and using administrative detention to shield itself from scrutiny." Palestinians have been subject to administrative detention in this region since 1945, first under the British Mandate and then in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The law has in some very rare instances been used against Israeli settlers, but it is overwhelmingly used to detain West Bank Palestinians, including children.  Administrative detainees are granted a hearing - at a military court, in front of an Israeli military judge - but the state is not required to disclose any of its evidence to the detainees or their lawyers. The detainees can then be sentenced to up to six months. But the six months can be extended indefinitely by the military court, meaning that administrative detainees have no real idea at any point how long they are going to be locked up.   "What really gets to you is the uncertainty," Yazen said, sitting in his living room. "Will you finish your six months and leave? Or will you be extended for a year, for two years?"  The detainees can mount an appeal, all the way up to Israel's Supreme Court, but with no access to the evidence against them, they have nothing to base it on. Palestinians who are formally tried in the military courts have more access to evidence, but the courts boast a roughly 99% conviction rate.  "Defending Palestinians in the military courts is an almost impossible task," said Jerusalem-based defence lawyer Maher Hanna.  "The entire system is designed to limit a Palestinian's capacity to defend himself. It imposes harsh constraints on the defence and relieves the state prosecutor of the burden of proof."  Israel's use of the policy in the West Bank had "crossed all lines - red, green, every colour", Yazen's mother Sadiah said.  "We are living under a parallel system of justice." When 16-year-old Osama Marmesh was detained, he was pulled off the street and into an unmarked car, he said. So for the first 48 hours of Osama's detention, his father Naif had no idea where he was. "You call everyone you know to ask if they have seen your son," Naif said. "You don't sleep."  Osama asked repeatedly during his arrest for the charges against him, he said, but was told each time to "shut up".When 17-year-old Musa Aloridat was arrested, in a 5am raid on his family home, Israeli forces pulled apart the bedroom he shared with his two younger brothers and fired a bullet into the wardrobe, smashing the glass, he said."They took him away in his underwear," Musa's father Muhannad said, holding up a picture on his phone. "For three days we knew nothing."Neither Yazen, Osama nor Musa, nor their parents or lawyers, were shown any evidence against them during their months of detention. When Israel published lists of the detainees to be released in the recent exchanges, in the column detailing the charges, against Yazen, Osama and Musa's names there was only the vague line, "Threat to the security of the area". Another version of the list said Yazen and Musa were suspected of being affiliated with Palestinian militant groups. When Osama was released, he was handed a brief charge sheet which said that on two occasions, months earlier, he had thrown a stone, "half the size of his palm", towards Israeli security positions.  Maurice Hirsch, the former director of military prosecutions, said that it would be wrong to draw any conclusions from the limited information available. "There's a very stark difference between the openly available evidence against these terrorists and what the intelligence information carries," he said.  "We see administrative detention being used by the Americans in Guantanamo, so we know that this measure is internationally recognised and accepted," he added. "And since this is an internationally accepted measure, why should it be only Israel that is prevented from using it, when we are dealing with probably the highest terror threat that anyone has ever seen?"  In the end, Yazen, Osama and Musa spent between four and seven months in prison. All three said that conditions had been relatively comfortable until the Hamas attack on 7 October, when their bedsheets, blankets, extra clothes and most of their food rations were removed, and all communication with the outside world was cut off, in what they described as collective punishment for the attack. Other detainees have alleged that they were beaten, tear-gassed or had dogs set on them.  The Israeli Prison Service confirmed that it had put the prisons into emergency mode and "reduced the living conditions of the security prisoners" in response to the Hamas attack. Yazen, Osama and Musa were all released early, because the exchange for Israeli hostages prioritised women and children. But, according to the most recent numbers from the prison service, there are still 2,873 people being held under administrative detention in Israeli jails.The day after he got home, Musa was back in his room, where he had been grabbed from his bed by the Israeli military four months earlier. The wardrobe doors, smashed by a bullet, had been taken off to be replaced, but the room had otherwise been put back together carefully by his parents. Musa had expected to be in prison much longer, he said. His lawyer had told him there was a 90% chance his detention would be extended.  All three boys said they wanted to try to finish school. But living under the constant threat of being locked up again was its own "kind of psychological detention", Musa said.  "They released us into a bigger prison", Yazen said.  "There is no peace," Yazen's mother said, looking over at him. "They can take you at any time."  Muath al-Khatib contributed to this report. Photographs by Joel Gunter.	
14/12/2023 19:11:00	Gaza war to take 'months', Israel tells White House - BBC News	Israel's war in Gaza may take "more than several months", the country's defence minister has told US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. Mr Sullivan arrived in Israel earlier on Thursday to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials. Earlier this week, Joe Biden said Israel's "indiscriminate bombing" of Gaza was costing it support globally. The UN this week warned of a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza.During a meeting with Mr Sullivan on Thursday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said that "Hamas is a terrorist organisation that built itself over a decade to fight Israel". "They built infrastructure under the ground and above the ground and it is not easy to destroy them," Mr Gallant said. "It will require a period of time - it will last more than several months, but we will win and we will destroy them."While the US has repeatedly pledged its support to Israel and sent billions of dollars worth of military aid, alarm is growing over the mounting civilian death toll of the war. President Biden is also facing increasing domestic calls - including some from within his own party - to do more to pressure Israel to exercise restraint during operations in Gaza. In a brief speech on Thursday, Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that US credibility is "on the line", as is the "credibility of our commitment to human rights" as a result of the Gaza conflict and a perception that Palestinian human rights are "conditional". "We cannot allow ourselves to set that precedent," she said. "There is a human cost that is too high and we have reached it. That's why we must join together and call for a ceasefire now." Mr Sullivan's visit to Israel comes just days after Mr Biden said that Israel was "starting to lose" international support because of the "indiscriminate bombing that takes place" in Gaza. On the same day, Prime Minister Netanyahu said in a statement that Israel had "the full backing" of the US, which had blocked "international pressure to stop the war".Citing two unnamed US officials, CBS - the BBC's US partner - has reported that Israeli officials have told the US that the current phase of military operations would last two or three more weeks, but would be followed by a prolonged campaign of targeted strikes aimed at Hamas leadership targets. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 18,400 people have been killed by Israeli bombing since 7 October, when a Hamas attack into Israel left about 1,200 people dead. At a news conference in Geneva on Thursday, the head of the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA)  said that conditions were becoming increasingly difficult, both for Palestinian civilians in Gaza and those who have successfully crossed into Egypt. "We meet more and more people who haven't eaten for one, two, or three days," he said. 	
14/12/2023 17:09:00	Israeli soldiers' mosque behaviour condemned by IDF - BBC News	The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has condemned the behaviour of some of its soldiers who were filmed singing and praying down a microphone in a mosque in Jenin in the occupied West Bank.It comes during an operation against militants in the city, which has so far left 11 Palestinians dead, the Palestinian health ministry says.The IDF said the soldiers "will be disciplined accordingly".It said it would also act in similar cases which have been filmed in Gaza.The clips, which are circulating on social media, show scenes of the mosque. In one recording, a song about banishing darkness, associated with the current Jewish festival of Hanukkah, is heard sung in Hebrew through a loudspeaker in a minaret. The person filming laughs and joins in with the song.Other clips show soldiers inside a mosque reciting a Jewish prayer down a microphone. The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned what it called "a mockery of [the mosque's] sanctity".In a statement on Thursday, the IDF said the soldiers "acted against IDF codes of conduct within a religious establishment".The statement said those responsible "were immediately removed from operational activity".It added: "The behaviour of the soldiers in the videos is serious and stands in complete opposition to the values ​​of the IDF."The incidents in Jenin are not the first time Israeli soldiers have been upbraided for bad behaviour filmed and posted on social media recently.Since Israeli forces have been fighting the war in Gaza from the end of October, videos have emerged including showing a soldier smashing up a toy shop, while the person filming laughs; soldiers setting fire to goods in the back of a lorry; and another rummaging through women's clothes in what appears to be a private residence.On Sunday, IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari condemned the soldiers' behaviour."IDF forces operate according to the values and spirit of the IDF," he said. "Soldiers on the battlefield are required to act professionally and ethically, and we will not compromise on this. In any event... [the videos do not] align with IDF values, command and disciplinary steps will be taken - this is the way in the IDF."In Jenin, meanwhile, Israeli forces have been battling Palestinian militants since the IDF launched an operation to arrest suspects there on Tuesday.Eleven Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops in the city, the Palestinian health ministry says. The ministry says one of those killed was a 13-year-old boy.The IDF says it has carried out house-to-house searches in the refugee camp there and has found dozens of weapons, explosives laboratories, tunnel shafts and observation posts. It says it has also detained hundreds of suspects.	
14/12/2023 16:40:00	Royal Armouries in Leeds displays AK-47 linked to Saddam Hussein - BBC News	A golden assault rifle from one of Saddam Hussein's palaces is going on display for the first time.The AK-47 is thought to have been gifted to someone by the Iraqi dictator. The weapon is part of a new exhibition at the Royal Armouries in Leeds.Re:Loaded examines the cultural power of guns and whether deadly weapons can be "disarmed" by transforming them into works of art.The golden AK-47 was found by UK Customs and Excise at Heathrow Airport in 2003 and is likely to be from a palace in Iraq, according to the Royal Armouries. It was discovered along with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, six bayonets and a sniper rifle in packages marked as computer equipment bound for an address in the US.The museum said dozens of gold-plated rifles were found in royal palaces during the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and were used as a form of gifting for influence, known in Arab countries as Wasta.The rare "art guns" collection includes highly-decorated weapons belonging to kings and tsarinas, high-profile diplomatic gifts to governments and generals and status symbols of the ultra-wealthy, the museum said.They include a diamond-encrusted Smith & Wesson revolver.Director general and master of the armouries Nat Edwards said: "This is a limited-time opportunity to get a rare viewing of some of our most highly-decorated, stunning and rare pieces."This is not about the glorification of guns, but the power they hold, not just literally, but in a cultural sense too."Re:Loaded also features two decommissioned AK-47 rifles loaned by Bran Symondson-Baxter, a special forces veteran, photojournalist, artist and peace campaigner."It's a personal honour to have two of my artworks featured in the Re:Loaded exhibition at the Royal Armouries," Mr Symondson-Baxter said. "One is embellished with butterflies and the other is covered with Love Heart sweets with the messaging on the sweets changed to match the narrative of the artwork."The juxtaposition of the objects comes from my own experiences in a conflict zone. "I wanted to flip the meaning of the instantly recognisable AK-47 weapon, and turn it from a thing of brutality into a thing of beauty," Mr Symondson-Baxter explained. 	
14/12/2023 15:02:00	Gaza doctor says lack of medicine is 'catastrophic' as diseases spread - BBC News	"The situation in the Gaza Strip and especially in Rafah is deadly."Dr Marwan al-Hams is the director of Rafah's Martyr Mohammed Yusuf al-Najjar Hospital, which has 63 beds but is currently caring for 145 patients.The hospital is operating at more than twice its capacity because Rafah, which lies on the border with Egypt, is now home to about one million displaced Palestinians, on top of the pre-war population of 300,000."The lack of medicine is catastrophic and there is no space in hospitals," Dr Hams told the BBC.After nine weeks of war between Israel and Hamas, only 11 out of Gaza's 36 hospitals are partially functional and able to admit new patients, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Only one of them is in the north.The hospitals have been overwhelmed by casualties, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting that at least 18,600 people have been killed and 50,500 wounded. Communicable diseases are also spreading in overcrowded shelters, schools and houses, and hospitals are receiving patients with severe diarrhoea, fatigue and a high temperature. Such infections are spread through contaminated water and food, as well as close contact with other people. The WHO says there is on average one shower per 700 people and one toilet per 150 people in Gaza.People trying to survive the Israeli bombardment. It is almost impossible for them to find soap or detergent, and everything else is secondary."The number of people coming to hospitals and health centres with chickenpox was around 4,593... five days ago," said Dr Hams. Measles is also an issue, with five cases so far recorded. Dr Hams said meningitis was another serious disease and that 115 cases had been recorded across the Gaza Strip.Skin diseases and rashes have also been spreading, with 35,300 cases at the territory's hospitals last Friday."We've also seen 17,511 cases of people coming to hospitals and clinics with parasites," he said. "We can't find the medication for them."In addition, there have been 19,350 cases of scabies - an itchy rash caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin - which is spread through close contact.Health authorities in Gaza have registered 350 cases of dysentery, an infection of the intestines which causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus, as well as vomiting and painful stomach cramps. It is highly infectious."This is all in addition to food poisoning," said Dr Hams. "Due to the shortage of food, people are resorting to eating old bread. They wash it, dry it in front of a fire or over a heater and then eat it."People are also presenting with jaundice, when your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow. It can be a sign of liver disease.More than 4,100 cases of hepatitis, a term used to describe inflammation of the liver, have been registered. There are five main types of hepatitis caused by specific viruses, with Hepatitis A usually caught by consuming food and drink contaminated with the faeces of an infected person.Dr Hams called for all wells to be opened so that displaced people could get clean water."Still water sources or swamps, which spread disease through mosquitoes and parasites, should be shut," he added. He was also sure that all the medical supplies that had entered the Gaza Strip have been used up."We are also now at the start of the cold weather. If flu or respiratory diseases spread, we will not be able to cope as a health ministry, especially in Rafah city," he warned."We used to get 1,500 daily cases every day at the reception area only. Now, we are already getting over 2,000 people coming in.""If it spreads more and becomes an epidemic, it will really be catastrophic."   Dr Hams ended with a plea for more fuel, which hospitals need for their generators. Fuel deliveries have been heavily restricted by the Israelis, who say Hamas could use it for military purposes."We are calling on officials to open the Rafah crossing to let fuel in, which is our life blood," he said. "All hospitals from north to south should get access."	
15/12/2023 22:00:00	Israel says it mistakenly killed three hostages in Gaza campaign - BBC News		
14/12/2023 06:01:00	Israel-Gaza war: What is the price of peace? - BBC News	Just getting to the end of the day and surviving the night must feel like a miracle in the Gaza Strip. Palestinians "plead for safety", wrote Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, the main UN relief agency in Gaza, in an "endless, deepening tragedy… hell on earth".It must be just as hellish for the hostages taken by Hamas and for the families of their victims. War is a cruel furnace that puts humans through terrible agonies. But its heat can produce changes that seemed impossible. It happened in western Europe after World War Two. Old enemies who had killed each other for centuries chose peace. Will the war in Gaza shock Israelis and Palestinians into ending their century of conflict over the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan river? I've been watching a video of a woman wracked by grief, sitting next to the body of her husband, Muhammad Abu Shaar. As Israel and Egypt are not allowing journalists to enter Gaza, I have not met her. I haven't been able to find out her name, which was not posted alongside those of her dead husband and children. In the video, it is as if she hopes, somehow, that the power of her grief will bring him back. "I swear, we promised to die together. You died and left me. What are we supposed to do, God? Muhammad, get up! For God's sake my beloved, I swear to God, I love you. For God's sake get up. Our children Nour and Aboud are here with you. Get up." The two children were with their father because all three of them had just been killed by Israel. An air strike destroyed the house they were hoping would shelter them in Rafah. I visited Yonatan Zeigen at his flat in Tel Aviv. It was a comfortable home, full of his children's toys. Among the family photos I recognised his mother, Vivian Silver, who was one of Israel's leading campaigners for peace with the Palestinians. Vivian was in the family home in kibbutz Be'eri, on the border with Gaza, when Hamas attacked on 7 October.The first time I met Yonatan, in the days after their kibbutz was attacked, he was hoping his mother had been taken into Gaza as a hostage. When he heard the air raid sirens in Tel Aviv, he rang Vivian. They switched to WhatsApp as they heard gunfire and explosions in the kibbutz, hoping that if she made no noise, Hamas would bypass the house. He read out the texts they exchanged, first some black humour and suddenly serious and full of love as she realised a massacre was happening."She wrote me, they're inside the house, it's time to stop joking and say goodbye," he tells me."And I wrote back that 'I love you, Mum. I have no words, I'm with you'. Then she writes, 'I feel you'. And then that was it, that's the last message."The next day, I visited her house in the kibbutz and saw it was burnt out. It took weeks for investigators to find Vivian Silver's remains in the ash left behind in the safe room. Yonatan has given up his career as a social worker to campaign for peace."They came into my country and killed my mother because we didn't have peace. So, to me, this just proves the point that we need it," he says."It could go either way. Catastrophes like this create changes in societies in the world. And I believe that it can lead to a better future."Issa Amro is a Palestinian activist in Hebron in the West Bank. The city is holy to Muslims and Jews, who revere it as the burial place of the prophet Abraham. It has been a flashpoint for decades. Issa is well known in Hebron and considered a troublemaker by Israeli soldiers who have enforced a curfew on Palestinians who live near the Jewish settlement in the heart of the city. He told me he was detained and beaten after the 7 October attacks. Like Yonatan Zeigen in Tel Aviv, Issa Amro believes that the war could produce a chance for Israelis and Palestinians to lead better and safer lives. "I think it's two opportunities. Either we choose to make it deeper and worse, or we make it as an opportunity to solve the conflict and to solve the occupation, to solve the apartheid and make living together possible because the security solution failed… only peace is the solution." It might seem a long way off now, and many more people are going to be killed before it happens, but like every war this one will stop. All the wars in and around Gaza since Hamas seized control there in 2007 have ended the same way, with a ceasefire deal. The ceasefires all came with a fatal flaw that guaranteed the next war between Israel and Hamas. That was because no attempt was made to end a century of conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. The killing and destruction in this war are of such a different order that no one can pretend there is any kind of normality to restore. This time it must be different. That much is accepted by Palestinians and Israelis and the outside powers that matter the most. The problem is agreeing which future to try to create. The Israeli government is heading for a diplomatic row with the United States, its most important ally, about what happens after the ceasefire. President Joe Biden is exasperated by what he called Israel's "indiscriminate bombing" of Gaza. Even so, he continues to back Israel, as he has since the start of the war, by deploying aircraft carriers, sending planeloads of weapons and vetoing ceasefire resolutions at the UN Security Council.In return, Joe Biden wants Israel to agree that the only way forward is revive talks to establish an independent Palestinian state. That was the objective of the Oslo peace process, which failed after years of negotiations. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not said much about how Gaza would be governed if and when he declares victory over Hamas. But he has rejected Joe Biden's plan. One constant in Netanyahu's long political career has been opposition to the independent Palestinian state that Oslo tried and failed to produce. Total victory and the unconditional surrender of anyone left alive in Hamas remain Israel's objectives. Annihilating Hamas, Mr Netanyahu believes, is the only way to rescue the hostages. A few hours before Mr Biden said Israel's bombing was indiscriminate, Mr Netanyahu made his own speech. "I will not allow Israel to repeat the mistake of Oslo," he said. "After the great sacrifice of our civilians and our soldiers, I will not allow the entry into Gaza of those who educate for terrorism, support terrorism and finance terrorism. Gaza will be neither Hamastan nor Fatahstan."Fatahstan is a derogatory reference to the Palestinian Authority, the rival to Hamas, which recognises Israel and co-operates with it on security. Israeli domestic politics feed into Mr Netanyahu's calculations. Opinion polls indicate that many Israelis blame him for the intelligence and security failures that allowed Hamas to break into Israel with such force. By doubling down on his opposition to Palestinian self-determination, Mr Netanyahu is trying to regain the trust of the right-wing Jewish nationalists who support his government.Yonatan Zeigen, the son of the slain peace campaigner Vivian Silver, says his mother would have been heartbroken to see the war, believing that wars cause more wars. "I think she would have said 'not in my name'… a war, if we're not too naïve, should be a means, right? But it feels like this war is a cause in itself, of revenge." Yonatan senses a new opportunity, to put peace back on Israel's political agenda. Peace campaigners were prominent in Israel until they were discredited as an armed Palestinian uprising erupted after the Oslo process collapsed in 2000. The idea of peace with the Palestinians vanished from mainstream Israeli politics. Now, Yonatan hopes, it is inching its way back. "Absolutely. You couldn't even say the word. And now people are talking about it."Issa Amro, the Palestinian activist in Hebron, told me life there is much harder for Palestinians since 7 October. "It got much worse. Ten times worse. More restrictions. More violence. More intimidation. People don't feel safe at all. People don't have enough food to eat. People don't get any access to a social life. No schools, no kindergartens, no work. It's a collective punishment inside an area which is very restricted." Issa got into a verbal spat with a group of Israeli soldiers while we were walking with him through the centre of Hebron. One of them, in combat gear, with an assault rifle and large pistol in a holster, wearing a black mask that only exposed his eyes, listened closely as Issa told me that peace was the only way ahead as there was no military solution to the conflict. The soldier wouldn't give his name when he butted into the conversation. "You don't know what it's like to grow up in Israel with neighbours like this," he said. "Gay rights, they beat the women, I saw this with my eyes. Yes. They kill their daughters if they have an affair with someone they don't like. They [Palestinians] are violent. I know them, I live with them. They don't want peace… They hate me. You know I can feel it. I know all the stuff they are telling. I don't talk to them."A chance for a peaceful future, for an independent Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel that the Americans, the British and many other countries say they want, will not emerge without sustained diplomatic and political will and determination. The old Oslo format, of negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis brokered by the Americans, ended in failure. If there is a next time, one idea mentioned by senior Western diplomats is to make Palestinian independence a crucial part of a broader package of change in the Middle East. Israel would be offered the prize of mutual recognition with Saudi Arabia, if they made the concessions necessary for Palestinian independence. Jordan and Egypt would be crucial players, as countries who have made lasting peace with Israel. Also vital would be Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, immensely wealthy Gulf states. Like the Saudis, they need peace in the Middle East as they spend hundreds of billions establishing themselves as global players. A blueprint already exists. Twenty years ago, the Saudi peace plan offered Israel full recognition and peace with Arab states, in return for a viable and sovereign Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank, with a capital in East Jerusalem. It could be relaunched by extending the existing Abraham Accords between Israel and some Arab countries, but adding to it the price tag of a Palestinian state. It is an ambitious idea, that would not happen without new Israeli and Palestinian leaders who believed in the project. The Americans could mediate, though they would have to be even-handed, something they have never managed before. Both sides would have to be prepared to make painful compromises on cherished beliefs, especially concerning territory. Political storms would break over leaders prepared to take risks for peace. Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist in 1995 when he tried to make peace with the Palestinians. An Islamist extremist killed Egypt's President Anwar Sadat because he made peace with Israel. And the war in Gaza would have to end as soon as possible. If it spreads, nightmare scenarios include desperate Palestinians breaching the Egyptian border as Israeli tanks close in and the escalation into full-scale war of the current cross-border exchanges between Israel and the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah. So much needs to go right for peace to have a chance. So much has already gone wrong that peace might just be impossible.	
13/12/2023 21:14:00	Israel to continue Gaza war with or without international support, FM says - BBC News	Israel's foreign minister has said it will continue the war in Gaza "with or without international support".A ceasefire at this stage of the conflict would be "a gift" to Hamas and allow it to return, Eli Cohen warned.Israel is facing mounting pressure over the number of Palestinian civilians killed by its military in Gaza and the worsening humanitarian crisis there.On Tuesday, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire.And in his strongest comments yet, US President Joe Biden said Israel was losing support worldwide because of its "indiscriminate bombing" of Gaza.Intense fighting continued in both the north and south of Gaza on Wednesday, while heavy rains worsened conditions for the hundreds of thousands of displaced people who are living in makeshift tents or out in the open.A senior UN aid official also warned that the Palestinian territory faced a "public health disaster" because of the collapse of its medical system and the spread of infectious diseases in overcrowded shelters.The war was triggered by an unprecedented attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people - including many women and children - were killed and about 240 taken hostage.Since then, more than 18,600 people have been killed in Gaza, about 70% of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.At Tuesday's emergency session of the UN General Assembly, 153 member states voted in favour of a non-binding resolution demanding an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire" in Gaza, and "the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, as well as ensuring humanitarian access".Eight states joined Israel and the US in voting against the resolution, including Austria and the Czech Republic, while the UK and Germany were among the 23 states which abstained. It was put forward by Arab and Muslim states after the US vetoed a binding resolution at the UN Security Council last Friday, saying an immediate ceasefire would allow Hamas to regroup. The day after the General Assembly vote and President Biden's warning, Eli Cohen told a visiting diplomat: "Israel will continue the war against Hamas, with or without international support.""A ceasefire at the current stage is a gift to the terrorist organisation Hamas, and will allow it to return and threaten the residents of Israel," he added, according to a statement from his office.So far, the US has supported Israel's opposition to a pause in hostilities.But senior American officials are increasingly demonstrating discontent with the way Israel is conducting its offensive. On 2 December, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin warned that Israel risked replacing a "tactical victory with a strategic defeat" if it did not sufficiently protect civilians in Gaza.Disagreements are also emerging about what a post-war Gaza will look like. On Thursday, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will arrive in Israel for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli media report that their discussions will include a timetable for the end of the war - and some suggest that Mr Netanyahu, by openly disagreeing with the Biden administration, is trying to appeal to his right-wing base.Speaking with Israeli military commanders serving in Gaza on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Netanyahu said the war would "continue until the end, until the victory, until the elimination of Hamas". And, reflecting "international pressures", he added that "nothing will stop us". However, as previous Israeli wars show, calls for a ceasefire will soon become too loud to be ignored.Israel is continuing to pound Gaza in the meantime, but Hamas and its allies are fighting back.Tuesday was the deadliest day for the Israeli military since its ground offensive began on 27 October.The military said 10 soldiers were killed, almost all of them in a co-ordinated ambush in the Shejaiya district of Gaza City, where there has been a focus of the ground operation in recent days.Hamas fighters "threw explosives at the soldiers and shot at them from inside a residential building in which underground terror infrastructure was also located", according to a statement.Hamas said the announcement confirmed the "failure" of Israel's leaders and military in the face of "strong resistance" from the group's armed wing.The UN's local humanitarian co-ordinator, Lynn Hastings, told reporters: "What is happening on the ground is not going to bring peace and security to either the Palestinians or Israelis for many, many years, if not generations to come. So a ceasefire is in the interest of everybody at the moment."She warned that the number of Palestinians being killed and injured was going up significantly every day and that almost half of Gaza's 2.3 million population had fled to the southern Rafah area, on the border with Egypt, in an attempt to avoid the Israeli bombardment.The collapse of the healthcare system, with only one-third of hospitals partially functioning, combined with the unsanitary conditions at overcrowded shelters, also meant there was "a textbook formula for epidemics and a public health disaster", she added.The UN estimates there have so far been 360,000 cases of infectious diseases, including meningitis, respiratory infections and diarrhoea, which is a leading cause of death among children under the age of five worldwide.	
13/12/2023 16:07:00	Support for Hamas grows among Palestinians in West Bank - BBC News	Since the war in Gaza began, Israel's military operations in the occupied West Bank have become more frequent, and more forceful.The northern city of Jenin - the epicentre of these raids before the Hamas attacks - is now a weekly battleground.The Palestinian teenagers I met who were running from the army there on Tuesday had the sceptical dismissive attitudes of much older men - mocking the Palestinian president and his appeals to the world for protection against Israel's occupation.Behind them, Israel's armoured bulldozers and military jeeps moved around the entrance to Jenin refugee camp, explosions and gunfire from across the city echoing along the deserted, shuttered streets.  The walls of this city are covered with the pictures of young men killed by Israeli forces - some of them members of armed groups like Hamas, proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and others. The posters and the faces are refreshed, year after year. Six men were killed in the operation here on Tuesday; four of them in a drone strike, witnesses said.  Israel says its operations in the West Bank are targeting members of armed groups, often those with Israeli blood on their hands.But the director of Jenin's hospital, Wissam Bakr, said a chronically ill 13-year-old child also died after being blocked from reaching medical care."The persistence of the incursions into Jenin, and the killing of young people - this will make the people more and more angry, because every day we lose one of our friends," he said. "This will not bring peace for Israel - this will bring more and more resistance."On 7 October, Hamas gunmen from Gaza attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 others hostage. More than 18,400 people are said to have been killed in Gaza during the war that followed.Here in the West Bank, 271 Palestinians, including 69 children, have been killed since the attacks - more than half the total number for the year. Almost all of them have been killed by Israeli forces, according to the United Nations.Since the Hamas attacks, support for armed resistance has risen in many parts of the West Bank - in places like Nablus and Jenin."I see it in the voices of people, in the music they play in their cars, from Facebook or social media posts, from my debates with my students," said Raed Debiy, a political scientist and youth leader for the West Bank's ruling party, Fatah, which dominates the Palestinian Authority (PA).He told me the attacks were "a turning point" for Palestinians, just as they were a shocking turning point for Israelis. "The people, especially the new generation, are backing Hamas now, more than at any other moment," he told me. "In the previous 30 years, there were no models, no idols for the new generation; now they see there is something different, a different story is being created." Even his 11-year-old nephew, he said, had little respect for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, but idolises Hamas military spokesman Abu Obeida - "because he protects us"."Palestinian youth had priorities and wish lists about owning a house, or getting a degree," explained West Bank political scientist Amjad Bushkar.  "But after 7 October, I think these priorities have totally changed. There are rising voices for full liberation of the homeland through resistance - whether that resistance is peaceful or armed."Dr Bushkar told me that he had spent a total of nine years in Israeli jails, and had been a member of Hamas's student wing in the past. Seven members of his family had been arrested since the 7 October attacks, he added.Hamas members in the West Bank have regularly been targeted by Palestinian security forces - not just Israeli ones - since the group took control of Gaza by force in 2007, a year after it won parliamentary elections. But now, Dr Bushkar said, something had changed."Both Fatah and Hamas are well aware that they are complementary to each other, and I think we'll see real integration between the two movements.""The Palestinian Authority realised that targeting Hamas would not eradicate it because it's an ideological movement rooted within the Palestinian people; and Hamas is fully aware that it cannot establish an independent [Palestinian] state without the help of Fatah."Some senior figures in the Palestinian administration - though not President Abbas - are now openly talking about the benefits of a united political front. Earlier this month, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said in an interview with Bloomberg that the Palestinian Authority's preferred outcome of the war in Gaza would be for Hamas to join a unity government led by the PA.Qossay Hamed, an expert in Hamas at Al-Quds Open University in Ramallah, says the crisis in Gaza could end up strengthening the movement's political wing, at the expense of its military one."In any revolutionary movement, there should be a political harvest to [military] actions," he said.  "There are so many trends within Hamas. And there are internal clashes. I think there will be more room for the political trend within Hamas, especially after this war, when the whole world will not be tolerant towards them."Israel says its goal in Gaza is to destroy Hamas, and has ruled out a role for either it or Fatah in Gaza's future government."I will not allow the entry into Gaza of those who teach terrorism, support terrorism and finance terrorism," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday. "Gaza will be neither Hamas-stan nor Fatah-stan."Some Palestinians privately say the price paid by Gaza for the Hamas attacks is too high.But others say the group's brutal tactics worked in forcing Israel to release Palestinian prisoners - and contrast its impact sharply with that of the Palestinian Authority, set up 30 years ago after the Oslo Accords to work with Israel on a future Palestinian State.An opinion poll carried out between 22 November and 2 December by a respected Palestinian think-tank, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PSR), found that support for Hamas had more than tripled in the West Bank compared to three months ago. Supporters of Hamas were still in a minority, but 70% of the respondents said armed struggle was the best means of ending the Israeli occupation.  By contrast, support for President Abbas had dropped sharply following the Hamas attacks, the survey found, with more than 90% of Palestinians in the West Bank calling for his resignation.Since the Hamas attacks, said Amjad Bushkar, "the world and the international community have put the Palestinian cause on its list of priorities."Widely seen as corrupt and ineffective, the PA has also been unable to pay its civil servants or police since the Hamas attacks, because the war in Gaza caused a rift over the tax revenues transferred by Israel each month.While Hamas flags and slogans multiplied here in the wake of each busload of Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza, the PA's president and security forces were conspicuously absent. Israel may be determined to deny Hamas power in Gaza, but here in the West Bank its influence is already spreading.	
13/12/2023 15:04:00	What was agreed on climate change at COP28 in Dubai? - BBC News	World leaders have reached a new agreement to tackle climate change at a big UN meeting in Dubai.The summit followed a year of extreme weather events in which many climate records were broken. COP28 was the 28th annual United Nations (UN) climate meeting, where governments discuss how to limit and prepare for future climate change.The summit took place in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It was scheduled to last from 30 November to 12 December 2023, but overran by a day.COP stands for "Conference of the Parties", where the "parties" are the countries that signed up to the original UN climate agreement in 1992. The UAE is one of the world's top 10 oil-producing nations. It appointed Sultan al-Jaber, chief executive of the state-owned oil company, as COP28 president.Oil - like gas and coal - is a fossil fuel. These are the main causes of climate change because they release planet-warming greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when burned for energy.Mr Jaber's oil company is expected to rapidly expand production this decade.Documents leaked to the BBC also suggested the UAE planned to use its role as COP28 host to strike new oil and gas deals. Mr Jaber previously argued that he was uniquely well-placed to push for action from the oil and gas industry. He said that as chairman of renewable energy firm Masdar, he had overseen the expansion of clean technologies like wind and solar power.For the first time, countries agreed on the need to "transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems".The text calls for this to be done "in a just, orderly and equitable manner". This is seen as an important recognition that richer countries are expected to move away from coal, oil and gas more quickly.However, the deal doesn't compel countries to take action, and no timescale is specified.Many groups - including the US, UK, EU and some of the nations which are most vulnerable to climate change - had wanted a more ambitious commitment to "phase out" fossil fuels. The agreement includes global targets to triple the capacity of renewable energy like wind and solar power, and to double the rate of energy efficiency improvements, both by 2030.It also calls on countries to accelerate low- and zero-emission technologies like carbon capture and storage. COP28 came at a crucial time for the key target to limit long-term global temperature rises to 1.5C.This was agreed by nearly 200 countries at COP21, which was held in Paris in 2015. The Paris commitment is crucial to avoid the most damaging impacts of climate change, according to the UN's climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).However, before the final deal was agreed at COP28, there were warnings that the world is actually on track for around 2.7C of warming by 2100.Recent progress had not been in line with what was required, the UN said, leaving a "rapidly narrowing" window for action to keep the 1.5C limit in reach. Around 200 nations were represented in the talks.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi were among the world leaders to attend the beginning of the summit.US President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping did not go, but both countries were heavily represented. King Charles gave the opening address, warning that humans were carrying out a "vast, frightening experiment" on the planet. Nearly 100,000 politicians, diplomats, journalists and campaigners registered for the meeting, making it the biggest climate conference ever held.This included around 2,400 people connected to the coal, oil and gas industries, which underlined concern about the influence of fossil fuel groups.As COP28 got under way, it was announced that the "loss and damage" fund could start handing out money.The fund was agreed at COP27. The idea is that richer countries - historically the main contributors to warming - pay poorer countries already facing the effects of climate change.But the details had remained deeply contested, with wealthy countries like the US reluctant to accept liability for past emissions.A relatively small amount of money has been pledged so far, but getting the fund up and running is seen as a crucial step in building trust between richer and poorer countries.Separately, in 2009, developed countries pledged to give $100bn (£80bn) a year to developing countries by 2020, to help them reduce emissions and prepare for climate change.The target was missed in 2020, but is "likely" to have been met in 2022, according to preliminary data. The COP28 agreement highlights "the growing gap" between the needs of developing countries and the money provided to cut emissions - but there is no requirement for developed countries to provide more support.Critics of previous COPs, including campaigner Greta Thunberg, accuse the summits of "greenwashing" - that is, letting countries and businesses promote their climate credentials without actually making the changes needed.But the summits do offer the potential for global agreements that go beyond national measures.For example, the 1.5C warming limit, agreed at COP21, has driven "near-universal climate action", according to the UN.This has helped bring down the level of warming the world can expect - even though the world is still not acting at anywhere near the pace needed to achieve the Paris goals.Ultimately, the success of COP28 will be determined by the changes the world puts into practice in the years ahead.

13/12/2023 14:36:00	A world of difference from Glasgow to COP28 in Dubai - BBC News	After two weeks of wrangling, a deal has finally been struck at the UN climate conference COP28 in the United Arab Emirates.The road to Dubai has been a long and winding one, which two years ago ran straight through the centre of Glasgow.For weeks, COP26's blue and green logo with its swirling globe was emblazoned on every lamp post as tens of thousands of delegates took over local hotels.Both events produced agreements described as "historic" but how will the two be compared in history?In the vast Expo 2020 conference centre on the outskirts of Dubai, the former US vice president and now prominent climate campaigner Al Gore told me Glasgow was "a very significant COP."He remembers the COP26 president Alok Sharma holding back tears as the language around "phasing out" coal was weakened at the last minute.It came through a surprise intervention from the floor by India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav.But Mr Gore adds: "That was the first time when any of the fossil fuels, in this case coal, was singled out."In the dying hours of Glasgow, I remember being in the vast plenary hall watching ministers and country negotiators in tight huddles discussing individual sentences and words.It seemed like it was never going to end until, at around 19:40, the final text of the Glasgow Climate Pact was agreed.Contrast that with Dubai at 11:00 local time as delegates were still getting comfortable at their desks.Just a few minutes after opening the final meeting and without any interventions from the floor, the UAE Consensus was agreed.The eyes looked bleary, as they did in Glasgow.It's no holiday for negotiators who end up locked in rooms through the day and night trying to find the common ground.The backdrop for both conferences was worlds apart.I don't mean the contrast between the 30 degree dry heat of the desert and the biblical rains which drenched everyone on the opening days of COP26.Covid-19 had postponed Glasgow by a year. It was meant to have been staged in 2020.But that shared experience of a pandemic had created a unity among nations to come up with a significant agreement.Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the war between Israel and Gaza have again divided the planet.Countries had even been struggling to agree where to hold next year's conference.But both Glasgow and Dubai are equally weighty stepping stones in the slow journey towards a decarbonised planet.Without Glasgow, Dubai's historic agreement to transition away from fossil would have struggled to be passed.Most agree that the UAE Consensus must also be a stepping stone to whatever comes next.Next year's venue has finally been agreed.It will be in Baku, Azerbaijan, and will be my sixth COP. But it's unlikely to be as significant as my latest or my home one.	
13/12/2023 14:19:00	Martin Lewis: 'I have dark days mental health wise' - BBC News	Martin Lewis has opened up about the "horrendous" pressure he feels giving advice on personal finance. The financial journalist and "Money Saving Expert" told BBC Radio 4's the Media Show he finds the stress "very difficult to manage"."If somebody applies for this [benefit] and it stops another benefit, I wouldn't sleep at night," he revealed. Mr Lewis's MoneySavingExpert website was sold for £87m in 2012 and he hosts "The Martin Lewis Money Show" on ITV. The personal finance expert, who received a CBE last year for services to broadcasting and consumer rights, said being seen as a trusted voice was "an incredible compliment". But speaking about that pressure and the toll it had taken on his mental health, Mr Lewis said he had "dark days"."One of the greatest difficulties is you think, 'Have I got it right? Have I got it right?" he explained. "People think I'm incredibly robust because of the way I talk and I come across. Actually, I'm quite a brittle person," he said. "I'm tired." Speaking about managing the stress of his job, Mr Lewis said he takes regular breaks and does breathing exercises and "huge amounts of exercise".But despite this, the 51-year-old said he was not a good example of how to deal with stress, and mentioned "periods where I find it very, very difficult to deal with".The financial journalist, who also hosts the "The Martin Lewis Podcast" on BBC Radio 5 Live, opened up about the pressure he felt to speak publicly about the war in Gaza. Mr Lewis, who is Jewish, said calls for him to do so were "bordering anti-Semitic"."I have never been asked about political situations in China, or Saudi Arabia, or South America," he explained. "I'm British. I'm a British Jew. My parents were born in Britain. All my grandparents were born in Britain. All my great grandparents were born in Britain. "And yet people somehow felt they could demand that, as a British Jew, I should be talking on a conflict in the Middle East, when I never talk about international affairs." In the end Mr Lewis did speak publicly about the conflict, saying he felt obliged to do so "to stop people asking".Addressing his silence on the issue on X, formerly Twitter, in early October he said: "Frankly I've struggled to process it, and felt the combined guttural fear for relations in Israel, anxiety about possible anti-Semitic backlash here, and grief over the loss of life of beautiful children both Israeli and Palestinian were things I didn't want to be public about."He said that Israel had the right to defend itself, but his heart went out to "innocent civilians in Gaza who will bear a brunt for the actions of Hamas".Have you been affected by issues covered in this story?

13/12/2023 03:32:00	Israel Gaza: UN General Assembly demands immediate ceasefire - BBC News	The UN General Assembly has overwhelmingly adopted a non-binding resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.On Tuesday, 153 member states in the 193-strong assembly voted in favour and 10 including the US and Israel against, with 23 abstentions.Palestinian representative Riyad Mansour said it was a "historic day".Israel's envoy Gilad Erdan said before the vote that a "ceasefire only serves to prolong Hamas's reign of terror".Senior Hamas official Bassem Naeem told the BBC that the passing of the resolution confirmed that "the prevailing international will is in favour of stopping the aggression against the Palestinian people".Although the US voted against the resolution, US President Joe Biden had earlier warned that Israel was losing international support because of "indiscriminate bombing" of Palestinians. He also expressed disagreement over plans for the future of the Gaza Strip, saying the Israeli government appeared opposed a two-state solution with the Palestinians.Tuesday's vote was the second attempt by the General Assembly to stop hostilities. In October, it had called for "a humanitarian truce" in a resolution adopted with 121 votes in favour, 14 against and 44 abstentions.Although non-binding, such resolutions are seen as a powerful measure of international opinion, analysts say.UN Secretary General António Guterres has long been pushing for a humanitarian ceasefire to prevent a "complete breakdown of public order" in Gaza.Last Friday, the UN Security Council - the body tasked with global peace and security issues - failed to adopt a draft resolution calling for a truce in Gaza. The US - one of the council's five veto-wielding council members - blocked the move. Israel has been carrying out air strikes and a ground offensive in the Gaza Strip after a Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October in which Israeli officials say 1,200 were killed and another 240 taken hostage. Some of the abductees were later released during a brief truce. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says Israel has killed more than 18,200 people and injured at least 50,000, including many women and children, during its ongoing military operation.	
12/12/2023 23:51:00	Israel losing global support over Gaza bombing, Biden says - BBC News	US President Joe Biden has said Israel is starting to lose global support over its "indiscriminate bombing" of Gaza.His comments, made to donors at a fundraising event on Tuesday, marked his strongest criticism yet of Israel's leadership. Mr Biden has offered unwavering public support to the country since Hamas launched its attacks on 7 October.And while he reiterated that Israel could count on US backing, he issued a direct warning to its government."Israel's security can rest on the United States, but right now it has more than the United States. It has the European Union, it has Europe, it has most of the world," he told donors to his 2024 re-election campaign in Washington."But they're starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place," he said.Mr Biden, however, added that there was "no question about the need to take on Hamas" and Israel had "every right" to do so.The US leader has faced growing pressure, including from within his own Democratic Party, to rein in Israel's military campaign. His remarks align with his administration's recent approach to the war, with officials urging Israel to "put a premium on human life" and give clearer instructions to allow people to avoid the conflict.Senior US officials have also displayed increasing discontent at Israel's military response.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 18,400 people have been killed by Israeli bombing since 7 October, when Hamas broke through Israel's heavily guarded perimeter and killed 1,200 people.In a statement later on Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had received the "full backing" of the US for its ground war as well as its goal of destroying Hamas and recovering hostages.He added that Washington had blocked "international pressure to stop the war"."Yes, there is disagreement about 'the day after Hamas' and I hope that we will reach [an] agreement here as well," he said.Mr Biden alluded to the pair's disagreement in his comments on Tuesday and said Mr Netanyahu had to "change" his government as well as his stance on a two-state solution, which top US officials have been promoting as the post-war path.That proposal is favoured by the international community to end the decades-long conflict, and would lead to the creation of an independent Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank existing alongside Israel."This is the most conservative government in Israel's history," Mr Biden said. "This government in Israel is making it very difficult for him. They don't want a two-state solution."His comments reflect the emerging disagreements about what direction to take after the war. Mr Netanyahu has said he opposes US calls to have the Palestinian Authority, which currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, take over control of Gaza.While Mr Biden's words were his bluntest yet, senior American officials have increasingly expressed discontent with Israel's military campaign.Secretary of State Antony Blinken said just days ago that there was a "gap" between pledges by Israeli authorities to spare civilians in Gaza and the reality on the ground.	
12/12/2023 13:04:00	Israel determined to finish Gaza operation despite civilian suffering - BBC News	Israel is on holiday. Schools are out, and away from the frontline areas the shopping centres are full. Cake shops are bursting with the doughnuts that Jews like to eat during Hanukkah, the current religious festival.It is different the closer you get to the fighting. Along the Gaza border, the area known by Israelis as the "envelope", tanks and troops are moving, civilians are mostly elsewhere and it looks like a war zone. In the north, along the border with Lebanon, communities have also been evacuated and the military continues to exchange fire with Iran's strongest ally, Hezbollah. But casual visitors might be able to deceive themselves that life has somehow returned to "normal" in central Israel, the broad swathe of land between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. A sharp reminder of how wrong that impression would be came as I drove down to Tel Aviv. The air raid sirens started, and the red alert app Israelis have on their phones sent out warnings as cars swerved onto the hard shoulder so the people inside could stop to take cover. Other drivers accelerated to speed out of the area. In the confusion, three cars managed to crash into each other. We pulled over as a group of women left their car and held each other in a tight, terrified embrace. Overhead, vapour trails from the Iron Dome anti-missile system arched towards the rockets coming from Gaza, loud explosions cracking across a deep blue sky as they downed most of the projectiles. One man was injured, in Holon, just off the highway. The fact that Hamas can still attack Israel is more proof that it is not beaten. The response of the motorists shows the depth of the trauma Hamas has inflicted on Israel, which is without doubt good news for the leaders of Hamas. Israel believes they are somewhere under Gaza, in some part of the tunnel system. "First of all, forget everything you thought you knew about Israel before 7 October. It's all changed," Amos Yadlin, a retired major-general said as we set up for an interview in his office in Tel Aviv, overlooking Israel's defence ministry. Mr Yadlin was a veteran fighter pilot who retired as head of Israeli military intelligence. We decided to interview him to get an idea of Israel's war strategy. In the end everything he said was just as interesting for what it said about mood in Israel. Mr Yadlin repeatedly compared Israel's fight against Hamas to World War Two. He was defending the huge number of killings by Israel of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip, and making the point that eliminating Hamas was vital for Israel's future. In a reference to the destruction of Dresden in Germany by the RAF in 1945, Mr Yadlin said: "You bombed Dresden with 120,000 people, killed women, children. We are trying to avoid this collateral damage. We ask them to leave. We ask them to go to the southern part of Gaza." I reminded him that Israel was also bombing the areas they had told Palestinians would be safe. Mr Yadlin insisted Israel was bombing Hamas, not civilians. "No, we didn't bomb them. We bombed the Hamas targets. Only Hamas targets and Hamas uses them as a human shield."He dismissed criticisms by the Biden administration in the US that Israel was killing too many Palestinian civilians. He said Israel was more careful about avoiding civilian casualties than the US and UK had been when they were bombing jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq. His interpretation is not shared by former generals involved in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. A senior British officer told me he was appalled by Israel's disdain for the laws of war that mandate the protection of civilians. He said it would not be allowed in the British army. Amos Yadlin, who still advises his successors in the Israeli military, believes Israel needs more time to reach its ambitious objectives in Gaza. It wants to rescue its hostages, kill the leaders of Hamas, annihilate it as a military formation that can threaten Israelis and destroy its capacity to govern. I pointed out that even though the US had vetoed the latest ceasefire resolution it was signalling that Israel had weeks not months to finish what it wanted to do. "It is not enough to achieve the goal," said Mr Yadlin. "If there is a ceasefire without returning the rest of the hostages, there will be no ceasefire." Israel has an immensely powerful army and the backing of the US. But it is discovering that for all its deep conviction that it has no choice other than to destroy Gaza to eradicate Hamas, allies as well as critics are appalled by the way it has killed more than 18,000 Palestinians, of which perhaps half were children. Israel has also discovered, as the Americans and others warned, that fighting a determined and prepared enemy in a built-up area is one of the hardest military jobs. As Amos Yadlin indicated, though, the Israelis look determined to push through the criticism to reach their objectives. After that comes the thorny issue about the governance and reconstruction of Gaza. Mr Yadlin said there would be no long Israeli occupation of Gaza, but if the current leadership's determination to control the strip for the foreseeable future does not change, occupation looks certain. 	
12/12/2023 11:39:00	MK Strinda: Yemen's rebel Houthis hit Norwegian tanker with missile - BBC News	Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have hit a Norwegian tanker with at least one missile, causing a fire.There were no casualties in the attack.A Houthi spokesman said the MT Strinda was delivering oil to Israel, but the ship's owners said it was headed to Italy with feedstock for biofuel.The group has vowed to block ships of any nation heading to Israel until Israel stops its offensive on Gaza, in what the Houthis say is a show of support for the Palestinians.The United States has said it will consider "appropriate responses" to any such attacks, which it describes as "fully enabled by Iran".Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said in a televised statement that the ship was targeted on Monday after its crew refused to respond to warnings.He said the group had prevented several ships from passing through Yemeni waters in recent days.The MT Strinda was attacked in the Bab El Mandeb strait at the entrance to the Red Sea.The missile caused a fire on board the ship but it was extinguished and the ship was able to make its way on to a safe port, ship owners J Ludwig Mowinckels Rederi said in a statement.They added that the 30-member crew, who are all Indian citizens, were unharmed.A US Navy destroyer provided assistance to the MT Strinda after receiving a mayday call, US officials said.The Bab El Mandeb Strait is a 20-mile wide channel that separates Eritrea and Djibouti on the African side from Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula.About 17,000 ships and 10% of global trade pass through it every year. Any ship passing through the Suez Canal to or from the Indian Ocean has to come this way.The Houthis - who are fighting Yemen's Saudi-backed government - have declared themselves part of an "axis of resistance" of Iran-affiliated groups opposing Israel, the US, and the wider West.They have already attacked several commercial ships this month, prompting a US destroyer to intervene, and in November they seized the cargo ship Galaxy Leader.	
12/12/2023 06:21:00	Son's 'sheer happiness' at hugging mother after Hamas release - BBC News	A British-Israeli man has told BBC London of his "sheer happiness" at hugging his mother after she was released by Hamas.Ada Sagi, who turned 75 when being held captive, was freed on 28 November, the fifth day of the Israel-Hamas truce.Her son Noam Sagi, who lives in north London, said: "For 53 days I was visualising that moment. Everything came into it."It was just squeezing and squeezing and squeezing and pinching myself."Mr Sagi said waiting to discover whether his mother was on the daily list of captives Hamas planned to free was "the most difficult part" of the ordeal."We knew how many people are there - and everybody's doing the maths. Chances are getting slimmer and slimmer, but I kept myself going. "I knew that it will come and it doesn't matter if it's day one or day five. She will be out. I'm absolutely convinced. So when it happened it was just sheer happiness." Mr Sagi said his mother was recovering well from her experience: "Of course she went through a huge, huge ordeal. Physically, she is generally OK."I always said if she's physically fine, her brain and her positive mindset will always be her strength."She will have to go through a lot. "But right now, I'm sitting here in London and I'm relaxed."Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

12/12/2023 06:00:00	Eyal Waldman: Israeli tech billionaire hopes for peace despite daughter's killing - BBC News	Danielle Waldman danced the last dance of her young life some time before dawn on 7 October. Soon afterwards she and her friends had to run for their lives, but they never made it home. There is a record of her final moments - a brief video, recorded on a phone. It gives only a hint of the horrors to come.The 24-year-old sits in the back seat of a car with two friends - strands of her long curly hair escaping from her grey hoodie. All three are casually dressed. There are fleeting smiles and overlapping voices, and a glimpse of blue wrist bands from the Supernova trance music festival they have just attended.They are trying to remain calm, but they are being hunted.Danielle's boyfriend Noam Shai is in front, behind the wheel. "Want me to drive very, very fast?" he asks. "I know how to do that." "Correct," replies a female passenger. A bearded young man sitting beside Danielle tries to provide reassurance. "We will be all right," he says. "Everything is ok, right?"Next, from the front, an urgent demand - "left, or right?"Then the video ends.  Minutes later Hamas gunmen riddled the car with bullets. Noam, Danielle, and their friends in the back seat were killed - as were nearly 360 other Israelis who went to dance at the festival in the Negev desert near the Gaza border. The front seat passenger was taken hostage.When the sun set on that day, 1,200 Israelis had been slaughtered - either at the festival or in their homes in kibbutzim close to the border. It was the worst loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust. The vast majority were civilians.Since then, Israel has gone to war in Gaza "to eradicate Hamas", and Palestinians in turn have been slaughtered. Almost 18,000 people have been killed at last count - according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza - 7,300 of them children. In Gaza now, as in Israel after 7 October, parents are burying their children. And for every parent, Palestinian or Israeli, the loss is incomparable.We meet Danielle's father Eyal in his art-filled office, high above Tel Aviv. He has long been a tech giant - who founded the Israeli chip maker Mellanox Technologies, and sold it for $6.8bn in 2019. But now he is simply a father, raw with grief, robbed of his youngest daughter. "She was an amazing girl," he says in a voice laden with love and grief. "She loved to dance. She loved animals. She loved people. She had many, many friends. She loved to snowboard, to scuba dive, to go on a motorcycle with Noam."When he got word that Danielle was missing, he raced back from a trip to Indonesia - getting permission to land in Israel, even though the airspace was closed. Three hours later he went looking for her, tracking her apple watch. It was a journey into a battlefield. "We were close to an engagement with seven terrorists, creatures, call them what you want," he says. "They had killed three or four soldiers. After that we took three officers in a jeep and went down south."  He found the bullet-riddled car, but there was no sign of Danielle."There was a lot of blood inside the car," he says. "I was hoping she wasn't in the car, or that she was wounded but was able to escape, or was taken hostage." Two days later her body was found."Everything she touched was with a smile. She never did anything wrong to anyone," he says, choking back tears. "She just loved doing good things. And they [Hamas] just murdered her for no reason."Despite the brutal killing of his youngest daughter, Eyal Waldman still believes that the Palestinians should have a state - and soon. "We need to change leadership on both sides. And then I hope in two to four years we'll be able to do peace and build two states for the two people and be able to live together next to each other," he says.But before that, he wants something else."Anyone that was responsible, anyone that was associated with what happened on 7 October 2023, will be eliminated. And we will take care of that," he says firmly. "We know exactly who came, who raped, who butchered.  We have videos, we have their cell phone numbers. We know who they are. We can eliminate them. And I think we can eliminate Hamas."The former Israeli army officer knows about waging war. He served in an elite unit - the Golani Brigade. He also knows about building bridges. In the past he opened a design centre in Gaza, donated $360,000 (£286,200) to a hospital there, and created jobs for Palestinians both in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank. Does he regret that now? "No, I don't," he replies without hesitation. "I think we need to do everything we can to make this place the best place to live in."And we need to stop killing each other and find a way to live together. I have been working for two-and-half decades trying to make peace."Just 10 days before Danielle was killed, she was chatting with her father about the future."She said 'you know Dad, I decided I am going to marry Noam,'" he recalls. "They were together for six years, and it was an amazing friendship and partnership. They were going to live in the country, raising kids. She wanted many kids and a lot of dogs and horses."The devoted young couple - who never got the chance to marry - were buried together instead.

Instead, I take a deep breath and try to avoid the question in a childlike way by changing the subject."Moein Abu Rezk is the only surviving relative of his four-year-old nephew, Omar, who is in a critical condition at Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip.Omar had to have his left hand amputated and was left with a large, open wound on his right leg, smaller wounds on his chest and face, and a dislocated jaw following an Israeli air strike that Moein says killed 35 members of his family, including his mother, father and grandmother.So far, Moein has decided to not tell Omar about their deaths, in case it causes his condition to deteriorate before he can be medically evacuated from Gaza via Egypt, hopefully as part of an initiative by the United Arab Emirates government and the Emirates Red Crescent."He needs to be told the information in a specific way so that he doesn't go into shock or go into a state that I can't control," Moein told BBC Arabic in a series of voice notes on Sunday night. "He knows that he hasn't seen any of them, and yet he feels the need to ask: 'Where is mum? Where is grandma? Where did they go?'"However, it is not guaranteed that an ambulance will transport Omar to the Egyptian border because of the intense fighting and heavy bombardment around what is known as Gaza's Middle Area.Israeli ground forces have already divided Gaza in two, fully encircling Gaza City in the first two months of the war with Hamas - which Israel, the UK and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation. Tanks and troops are now pushing deep into the southern city of Khan Younis. The main highway from Deir al-Balah has been declared a "battlefield", leaving people in the Middle Area with only one supposedly safe evacuation route along the Mediterranean coast.Many Palestinians living in the north of Gaza sought refuge in the Middle Area after the Israeli military ordered them to evacuate their homes and move south of the Wadi Gaza river two months ago. That order came at the start of the war triggered by a cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others were taken hostage.Since then, more than18,200 people have been killed in Gaza according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Omar is among the more than 49,000 other people so far reported injured.The Israeli military says its forces are operating to eliminate terrorists, locate weaponry and destroy terrorist infrastructure, and that more than 22,000 targets have been struck since the start of the war.Moein told BBC Arabic that Omar and his family had been visiting his grandmother's house in Nuseirat camp, just to the north of Deir al-Balah, when it was bombed without any prior warning from the Israeli military. "We have never seen missiles like that before. The missile falls and destroys the whole residential area around it," he recalled."Luckily, the house had an opening through which [Omar] fell. But his left arm was [so badly] injured that it had to be amputated immediately. "[On Saturday], he lost about three units of blood and his haemoglobin [concentration] fell from 9.5 to 7.4, so he had to be transferred to surgery for a blood transfer." Moein said the situation at the hospital was so bad that doctors could not find a bed for Omar despite the severity of his injuries, forcing him to wait in a corridor while doctors and nurses treated him as best as they could."All medical equipment and tools are so limited to the extent that the we have to deal with the situation in a more practical rather than a healthy way."There are no painkillers so we have to joke around and try to make him laugh in order to calm him."Moein conceded that this method only worked some of the time but added: "We don't have any other option."He said he hoped that Omar would be transported next Thursday to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and then taken to a hospital for specialist treatment. Lena Shakora, her husband and three young sons have so far survived the Israeli bombardment, but she said they were still living a "nightmare".They fled their home in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City and are currently sheltering in a house in an agricultural area outside Deir al-Balah with their relatives."I wake up every day remembering that we are at war [and] people are starving. Its torture to be displaced from your house and find no food," Lena told BBC Arabic on Sunday night. "My family and I are sitting with 40 individuals in one room and all the windows are [blown out] because of the bombing. We are basically sitting outdoors... and it is very cold and people are humiliated."Lena said her sons had hurt their backs because they were having to carry containers of water. And to make matters worse, the water is not clean because treatment plants and pumps are not working because of a lack of fuel.The family was also being forced to eat contaminated food because shops were empty and they had not received any aid, she added. "Our greatest hope is to have flour so that we can bake, and even that we can bake it on [clean] wood." "People go around collecting whatever wood they can find. But the bread comes out contaminated because it is cooked on wood from the scene of a bombing," she explained.The UN said on Sunday that it had been unable to distribute outside the southern city of Rafah, on the border with Egypt, in recent days because of the intensity of hostilities and restrictions on movement.Additional reporting by BBC Arabic's Marwa Gamal and Doaa Fared

11/12/2023 08:17:00	Teenage children of jailed Narges Mohammadi accept her Nobel Peace Prize - BBC News	The teenage twins of jailed Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi have accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf.Ms Mohammadi - who is serving a 10-year jail term in Tehran - won this year's prize for her work fighting against the oppression of women in Iran.In a speech smuggled from prison and read out by her children, she denounced Iran's "tyrannical" government."The Iranian people, with perseverance, will overcome repression and authoritarianism," she said."Have no doubt, this is certain."The prestigious peace prize was handed out in Oslo on Sunday, along with the other Nobel prizes for literature, science and economics.Ms Mohammadi has for years been a prominent human rights figure in Iran. The 51-year-old has been in jail almost continuously since 2010 - and in total has been arrested 13 times, convicted five times, and sentenced to a total of 31 years in prison. She is currently in jail for "spreading propaganda".Her husband, political activist Taghi Rahmani, lives in exile in Paris with their two children and they have not seen one another for years.In a speech smuggled out of Iran and delivered by her 17-year-old children Kiana and Ali Rahmani in French, Ms Mohammadi said: "I write this message from behind the high, cold walls of a prison."She praised young Iranians who she said have "transformed the streets and public spaces into a place of widespread civil resistance" - referring to the protests that began last year following the death of Mahsa Amini. "The resistance is alive and the struggle is not weakening. Resistance and non-violence are our best strategies - it is the same difficult path that Iranians have walked until today, thanks to their historical consciousness and their collective will."The twins collected the prize - which includes a cheque for 11 million Swedish crowns (about £837,000, or $1m) - at a ceremony in Oslo's City Hall attended by several hundred guests. There was an empty chair on the podium between her children, to mark her absence.On Saturday, Ms Mohammadi's husband, Mr Rahmani, told BBC Hardtalk that his wife had once written a letter to their children expressing the hope "they would forgive her" for not being able to "be a mother to them". He said she was among a group of imprisoned human rights activists "standing up against the tyranny of the Islamic Republic".A month ago, Ms Mohammadi began a hunger strike in the notorious Evin prison where she is being held.Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - the British-Iranian national who spent six years in an Iranian jail accused of spying and who attended the ceremony in Oslo on Sunday - said Ms Mohammadi was an individual everyone relied on.Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who met Ms Mohammadi while in prison, said: "What she gave others was the support and the love and the peace of mind that you are going to be looked after the moment you enter this space."She said Ms Mohammadi was known for her kindness and how much she cared for people. "But I think more than that, one thing that if you have lived with Narges, you would know is, that Narges would live life to its fullest, with all its beauty, and at the same time she would choose to fight if she would want to... I think that's remarkable."Iran's foreign ministry previously said the Nobel award was "biased" and in line with "the interventionist and anti-Iran policies of some European countries".Also on Sunday, Norwegian author Jon Fosse is being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, while three scientists are receiving the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for their work in developing what are called quantum dots. This year's Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L'Huillier, whose work demonstrated a way to create extremely short pulses of light that can be used to capture and study rapid processes inside atoms.              	
10/12/2023 18:10:00	Israel-Hamas war: Ceasefire in Gaza chances shrinking, Qatar says - BBC News	Israel's bombardment of Gaza is "narrowing the window" for a new truce, the Qatari prime minister has said. Speaking at the Doha Forum, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said Qatar would continue its efforts to pressure both sides into a ceasefire. The Gulf state played a key role negotiating the week-long pause in violence at the end of November, which allowed the release of hostages. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday "the war is in full swing".He said in recent days "dozens of Hamas terrorists" had surrendered, and were "laying down their weapons and handing themselves over to our heroic fighters"."This is the beginning of the end for Hamas," he said.The comments come as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen.On Sunday afternoon, the Hamas-run health agency in Gaza said almost 18,000 Palestinians had now been killed. In an audio message to Al Jazeera, Hamas's armed wing said the temporary ceasefire had "proved its credibility" and that no more hostages would be freed until Israel engaged in talks. In the message, spokesman Abu Ubaida also said Hamas fighters had fully or partially destroyed 180 military vehicles and killed "a large number" of Israeli soldiers, and that it is still inflicting blows on Israel, and "what is coming is greater".At the conference in Doha, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said the area had become "hell on earth" and was "definitely the worst situation I have ever seen". Also speaking at the conference, Palestinian PM Mohammad Shtayyeh said Israel "should not be allowed to keep violating international humanitarian law", and called for international sanctions. Mr Shtayyeh represents the Palestinian Authority, the organisation which operates in the West Bank and which is separate to the Hamas government operating in Gaza. As the meeting took place in Doha, in the south of Gaza fighting continued to rage. The city of Khan Younis, the place people were told to head to to escape the fighting in the north, is now under heavy bombardments - with Israel asking civilians to leave its centre. Speaking to BBC News, senior Israeli adviser Mark Regev said there was going to be "difficult fighting" in Khan Younis, and urged civilians to "move to safe zones" - with Israeli tanks reaching the centre of the city on Sunday evening.  Civilians in the city have been pictured collecting bodies and mourning family members killed in fighting.When asked about the situation in what Israel calls safe areas, Mr Regev said his country has made a maximum effort to try to safeguard civilian lives.Civilians in Gaza have formerly been advised to make their way to a "safe zone" at al-Mawasi. Measuring just 8.5 sq km (3.3 sq miles), the area is smaller than London's Heathrow Airport, has few buildings and largely consists of sandy dunes and agricultural land.Meanwhile, Israel has also been engaging in international diplomacy - calling out its allies for an inconsistent approach. "You cannot on the one hand support the elimination of Hamas and on other pressure us to end the war, which would prevent the elimination of Hamas," said Mr Netanyahu while briefing his cabinet.He was speaking two days after 13 members of the UN Security Council supported a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire, with the US vetoing the move and the UK abstaining. Israel also denied a claim by UNRWA chief Mr Lazzarini that it was trying to force Gazans out of the region and into Egypt - something previously reported in Israeli media.  The World Health Organization has also taken the unusual step of passing a resolution calling for immediate medical access to Gaza, with its director-general earlier calling the situation in the area "catastrophic". 	
10/12/2023 17:59:00	Israel-Gaza war: Video shows Gaza detainees allegedly 'surrendering guns' - what we know - BBC News	Images of detained and stripped Palestinians apparently surrendering some weapons to Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip have prompted speculation about the circumstances of the events and the filming.Initially, two videos of what appeared to be the same scene - a man in his underwear obeying instructions to lay down a weapon - but with slight differences, sparked speculation it may have been filmed repeatedly for separate "takes".BBC Verify has examined the footage and established that both clips came from a continuous sequence in which three guns in total appear to be handed over. But questions remain about the exact circumstances and the release of the videos.Two separate clips depicting the same scene but with minor discrepancies circulated on social media on Saturday 9 December. This led to accusations that different "takes" had been filmed. Some pointed to how the man in the video was holding the gun in a different hand in the two scenes.BBC Verify has found that in fact these videos are different sections of a continuous sequence, not separate takes, and the same man is going to and fro bringing different guns to the pavement with their detached ammunition.In the footage, dozens of other men are seen standing across the road watching, also in their underwear, many of them with their arms aloft and holding identity cards. BBC Verify has established they are in front of a UN school in Beit Lahia, north of the Jabalia refugee camp.One video, which we know was shot first because of the position of the sun, shows the man placing a gun from his right hand on top of another on the pavement. In the next video, with the sun lower, the man places a different gun on top of those from his left hand. Still images corroborate and bookend this sequence, with one showing the very first gun being placed, and another showing the resulting three guns and magazines on the pavement. There are still some questions raised by the footage. Notably, the man is being held at gunpoint and issued directions from off-screen, so it's unclear whether he is "surrendering" the weapons or just moving them as instructed. Given he is already in his underwear and he cannot have been concealing them on his person, it's unlikely Israeli troops did not know about these weapons, suggesting this may be performed for the camera, rather than as an act of authentic surrender. We also don't know if he, or any of the other individuals in the video, have any involvement with Hamas or the 7 October attack.In one of the videos, the end of what seems to be a DSLR zoom lens is briefly visible. There were also photographs circulating alongside the videos which were captured from a slightly different angle. This suggests the events were filmed or photographed by more than one person or camera.Over the past week, emotive images of Palestinians being detained in Gaza have provoked strong reactions - with some expressing concern over the treatment of the prisoners, and the Red Cross saying all detainees must be treated in accordance with international law.But Israel has been keen to show evidence it's making progress against Hamas in Gaza. On Sunday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: "In recent days, dozens of Hamas terrorists have surrendered to our forces. They are laying down their weapons and handing themselves over to our heroic fighters."It will take more time, the war is in full swing, but this is the beginning of the end for Hamas."The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not respond directly to questions about the circumstances of these videos but a spokesperson told the BBC that detained individuals "are treated in accordance with international law"."It is often necessary for terror suspects to hand over their clothes such that their clothes can be searched and to ensure that they are not concealing explosive vests or other weaponry."Additional reporting by Paul BrownSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.	
10/12/2023 14:50:00	Met Police underfunded for unique demands of London, mayor writes - BBC News	The Metropolitan Police lacks the funding it needs to meet London's “unique demands”, Sadiq Khan has said.The mayor has written to Home Secretary James Cleverley to call for an increase in the National and International Capital City (NICC) grant. NICC is a mechanism provided to the Met to support the additional costs of policing a capital city – including protests, sporting events and diplomatic protection. The Home Office said the force will receive up to £102.3m more in 2023/24 than the previous year.In his letter, Mr Khan wrote: “The Home Office’s independent expert review in 2015 identified a £159m annual gap in funding (at 2015 prices) and recent estimates from the [Metropolitan Police Service] suggest it could now be £240m.”The mayor highlighted the policing of protests and vigils connected to the Israel-Gaza war since October as a strain on police resources. He said 28,000 shifts have been completed in connection with the events. “These additional costs result in reduced resource available for frontline and neighbourhood teams,” he said.Officer welfare is also taking a hit, the mayor wrote, with 4,000 rest days being cancelled. “Many officers have worked every weekend since 7 October and sickness rates are rising, a trend which is likely to continue,” he added.Mr Khan singled out Just Stop Oil protests as a particular repeated issue for police.Figures released by the Met this week show 657 arrests were made over the last five weeks at the climate protests, at a cost of £3.5m.A Met spokesperson said it also resulted in “10,500 officer shifts being taken away from communities”.“The return of a fully funded NICC would not only benefit our officers but all those who live, work or visit London,” Mr Khan said.Susan Hall, Conservative assembly member at City Hall and party candidate for mayor of London, said it is "vital" the force has the resources it needs."Sadiq Khan has been given millions by the government to get more boots on the ground," she added. "He failed to hit that target and had to give much of that cash back."A spokesperson for the Home Office said it was "giving the police the resources they need to tackle crime".“The Metropolitan Police will receive up to £3.3bn in 2023/24, an increase of up to £102.3m on the previous year," they said."This includes £185.3m in recognition of the increased demands the force faces from policing the capital city.“We have also provided an additional £75.3m of in-year funding to support the force in managing the costs associated with the 2023/24 pay award.”

10/12/2023 03:33:00	Egypt election: Discontent grows as Sisi seeks third term - BBC News	Once hailed by many people as a saviour, Egypt's strongman leader Abdul Fattah al-Sisi is now seen in a very different light. Egyptians who took to the streets to cheer for the general-turned-president a decade ago are not as happy as they hoped they would be. As Mr Sisi runs for his third consecutive term as president next week, a crumbling economy is top of most people's list of complaints.  Nadia is one of those struggling to make ends meet as Mr Sisi's government continues to implement what it calls "economic reforms".The 57-year-old widow and mother of six can barely make a living selling newspapers at a street-side kiosk. In her small flat in one of Cairo's crowded slums, Nadia tells me that she last bought meat three years ago. To her, life is becoming more unaffordable by the day."I am too scared to go to sleep sometimes, because I know the next morning prices will have gone up," she says with a faint smile and eyes full of pain.The latest official figures show that Egypt's inflation rate in October was 38.5%, a slight fall from the record 40.3% reported the previous month.  These numbers are unheard of in the Arab world's most populous country, and the real inflation rate experienced by ordinary people is often much worse than the government's figure. But as prices have risen, Nadia's income has dropped. More than a decade ago, she used to sell nearly 200 newspapers a day, but today it is barely 20. Nadia says today cooking a meal costs between 300 and 500 Egyptian pounds (£7.70-£13; $9.70-16.20), but a few years ago it was about a sixth of the price."Even fruit is too expensive," she tells me. In the past nine months, the Egyptian pound has lost more than 50% of its value against the US dollar. With the Egyptian economy heavily dependent on imports, the prices of basic commodities have skyrocketed beyond the reach of many households and a black market for foreign currency has flourished.Nadia does not have much hope and is obviously apprehensive. "No-one thinks of the poor. It's as if we are invisible," she says, adding with a sigh: "We are forgotten."Since Mr Sisi became president in 2014 - a year after he led the military's overthrow of his Islamist predecessor, Mohammed Morsi - huge sums of money have been spent on huge infrastructure projects.Roads have been expanded and flyovers built, and a new capital costing billions of dollars has been constructed near Cairo that is barely inhabited.Critics say this "financial imprudence" has drained much of the country's economic resources and created unprecedented levels of debt that have crippled the economy. The president's supporters believe the urban expansion has made people's lives easier and will help attract much needed foreign investment, eventually ushering in more prosperous times.Walid Gaballah, an economist and a member of Egyptian Society for Political Economy, Statistics and Legislation, believes these projects have created jobs and succeeded in making a significant impact in addressing Egypt's unemployment problem.He also believes part of the blame for the current economic meltdown lies with global forces. "All the savings created by the government's reform programmes were eaten up by the coronavirus pandemic. Then came the Ukraine war that drove many foreign investors to withdraw their money from Egyptian banks," he says.The government has repeatedly drawn attention to its investment in social welfare programmes that provide a safety net for the poorest and most vulnerable Egyptians. But people still complain about their living conditions going from bad to worse.Official figures show that nearly 30% of Egypt's 100 million population lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the government has borrowed more than $20bn from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to support its budget.At the same time, government austerity measures, deemed necessary for "an economic overhaul" of the country, have been imposed. Subsidies have been removed from many key goods, like fuel, pushing prices up. Despite the widespread discontent, Egyptians have not got much choice in this election, seen by many as a one-horse race. Opposition groups complain that they cannot operate effectively due to a constant crackdown on dissent.Although three low-profile politicians are running against the president, many people believe the outcome of the vote is not in question - Mr Sisi will easily win a new six-year term in office.One potential frontrunner in the election was former MP Ahmed Tantawy, but he dropped out of the race after failing to gather the required number of endorsements from members of the public. In October, he accused the authorities of arresting nearly 100 members of his campaign, to discourage him from running.Mr Tantawy is now on trial, facing charges of printing and circulating election papers without an authorisation.Like opposition politicians, human rights campaigners are also complaining about tight security restrictions. They say it is increasingly difficult to document alleged abuses.  "Human rights is a dangerous business in Egypt," says Mina Thabet, an activist who has been living in a self-imposed exile in the UK for nearly six years, tells me via Zoom.He still recalls the painful memories of the month he spent detained in Egypt in 2016 after he was accused of a range of charges, including belonging to a banned group and spreading false news, which are often levelled at opponents of the government."I have been blindfolded and handcuffed. An officer has physically assaulted me and threatened to strip me naked and torture me."Mr Thabet went to the UK to study a year after his release. He decided not to go back home as he was worried he might be sent back to jail at any moment. "The first night I had a good sleep was after I left Egypt," he says.He sees the election as nothing but an extension of Mr Sisi's heavy-handed policies, which he says have no tolerance for opposition."Many of my fellow human rights defenders in Egypt are either having their assets frozen, or their names put on a travel ban list. You can't do your job, without the fear of getting prosecuted or persecuted."Mr Thabet tells me he will only go back to Egypt when he feels safe to work and express his views without any potential government retaliation.The authorities have long dismissed such criticism as politicised. They have set up a committee that has granted presidential pardons to dozens of political detainees, and have promised to do more to improve the country's human rights record.But local and international human rights groups speak of tens of thousands of political prisoners locked up behind bars - a figure the government disputes. Banners bearing photos of Mr Sisi hang on every street corner in Cairo.His campaign is trying to convince voters that better days lie ahead. But many people here wonder if his re-election would really change anything. 	
10/12/2023 01:56:00	Israel-Gaza war: Half of Gaza's population is starving, warns UN - BBC News	A senior UN aid official has warned that half of Gaza's population is starving, as fighting there continues.Carl Skau, deputy director of the UN World Food Programme, said only a fraction of supplies needed have been able to enter the Strip - and nine out of 10 people cannot eat every day.Conditions in Gaza have made deliveries "almost impossible", Mr Skau said. Israel says it must continue air strikes on Gaza to eliminate Hamas and bring Israeli hostages home.Israel Defence Forces spokesman Lt Col Richard Hecht told the BBC on Saturday that "any death and pain to a civilian is painful, but we don't have an alternative"."We are doing everything we can to get as much as possible inside the Gaza Strip," he said.Herzi Halevi, chief of staff of the IDF, was filmed telling soldiers the army has to "press harder" because "we're seeing terrorists surrendering... a sign their network is collapsing".Meanwhile, the Biden administration has used an emergency law to bypass Congress and authorise the sale of some 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth more than $106m (£85m) to Israel.Movement in and out of Gaza has been heavily restricted since 7 October, when Hamas fighters broke through Israel's heavily-guarded perimeter fence - killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages. In response, Israel closed its borders with Gaza and began launching air strikes on the territory, restricting aid deliveries which Gazans heavily relied on.The Hamas-run health ministry says Israel has killed more than 17,700 Gazans in its retaliatory campaign, including more than 7,000 children.Only the Rafah crossing bordering Egypt has been open, allowing limited quantities of aid to reach Gaza. This week Israel agreed to open the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel into Gaza in the next few days - but only for the inspection of aid lorries. The trucks would then go to Rafah to cross into Gaza.Mr Skau said nothing had prepared him for the "fear, the chaos, and the despair" he and his WFP team encountered during their trip to Gaza this week. They witnessed "confusion at warehouses, distribution points with thousands of desperate hungry people, supermarkets with bare shelves, and overcrowded shelters with bursting bathrooms," he said. International pressure and a temporary seven-day ceasefire last month had allowed some badly-needed aid to enter the Gaza Strip, but the WFP insists a second border crossing is now needed to meet demand.Nine out of 10 families in some areas are spending "a full day and night without any food at all", according to Mr Skau. People in Khan Younis in the south of Gaza, a city now surrounded on two fronts by Israeli tanks, say the situation there is dire. Dr Ahmed Moghrabi, head of the plastic surgery and burns unit in the city's only remaining health facility, Nasser hospital, fought back tears as he spoke to the BBC about the lack of food. "I have a daughter, three years old, always she ask me (for) some sweets, some apple, some fruits. I can't provide. I feel helpless," he said."There is not enough food, there is not enough food, only rice, only rice can you believe? We eat once, once a day, only."Khan Younis has been the focus of heavy air strikes in recent days and the boss of Nasser hospital there said his team had "lost control" over the numbers of dead and wounded arriving at the facility.Israel says Hamas leaders are hiding in Khan Younis, possibly in an underground network of tunnels, and that it is fighting house to house and "shaft to shaft" to destroy the group's military capabilities. Speaking on Saturday, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, accused the United States of being complicit in war crimes, after it vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.  Out of 15 of the Security Council members, 13 countries voted in favour of the resolution calling for a ceasefire. The UK abstained from the vote and the US was the only country to vote against the resolution.Mr Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, said he held Washington responsible for "the bloodshed of Palestinian children, women, and elderly in Gaza at the hands of [Israeli] occupation forces". The US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, defended the veto, and said the resolution was calling for an "unsustainable ceasefire" which "would leave Hamas in place able to repeat what it did on October 7".Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Saturday he appreciated the "correct stance" the US had taken at the security council. A seven-day temporary ceasefire ended just over a week ago. Under the truce, 78 hostages were released by Hamas in exchange for 180 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. There are still more than 100 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. On Saturday, it was confirmed that Israeli hostage Sahar Baruch, 25, had been killed, his kibbutz and a hostages' group said in a statement.It comes after the armed wing of Hamas released a video on Friday which it said showed the bloody aftermath of a failed IDF operation to free an Israeli hostage.	
09/12/2023 18:37:00	Iran: Mahsa Amini's family stopped at airport on way to collect award - BBC News	The family of Mahsa Amini have been banned from flying to France to collect a top human rights prize in her honour.Ms Amini's parents and brother were stopped from boarding their flight and had their passports confiscated, their lawyer said.They were travelling to Strasbourg to be presented with the EU's Sakharov Prize - which has been awarded posthumously to Ms Amini.Their lawyer said they were banned from leaving despite having valid visas. Ms Amini's death last year sparked protests unlike any the country had seen before.She died in hospital in Tehran on 16 September 2022, three days after she was detained by morality police in the capital for allegedly violating Iran's strict rules requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf.Witnesses said the 22-year-old Kurd was beaten while in custody, but authorities denied she was mistreated and instead blamed "sudden heart failure" for her death.In October, the European Union announced it was posthumously awarding its top rights prize to Ms Amini and the global "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement that her death triggered.Speaking to the AFP news agency, the family's lawyer, Chirinne Ardakani, said Ms Amini's mother, father and brother had been "prohibited from boarding the flight that was to take them to France for the presentation of the Sakharov Prize".She said the Iranian authorities "have never been so mobilised to prevent the families of the victims from speaking to the international community".  The president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, called on Iran to "retract the decision" to ban the family from travelling."Their place next Tuesday is at the European Parliament in Strasbourg to receive the Sakharov Prize, with the brave women of Iran," she said on social media. "The truth cannot be silenced."In September, on the anniversary of his daughter's death, Ms Amini's father Amjad was detained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and warned against marking the anniversary of his daughter's death, according to human rights groups. Thousands of people around the world did mark the anniversary, taking to the streets in mass protests. Mr Amini was later released.	
09/12/2023 12:19:00	Palestinian recounts being stripped and driven away by Israeli army - BBC News	A 22-year-old Palestinian has told the BBC how he was detained with dozens of others by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in northern Gaza on Thursday.Footage verified by the BBC shows a group of men stripped to their underwear, kneeling on the ground and being guarded by Israeli soldiers.The man says he was forced to sit in the street for hours, handcuffed and blindfolded, before being driven away.An Israeli official said the soldiers were searching for Hamas members.Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told the BBC they were looking for those "responsible for the massacre of October 7".The detainees were taken by truck from Beit Lahia in northern Gaza to an unknown place, according to the young man - who asked to remain anonymous for his safety. Once they arrived, they were randomly selected for questioning and interrogated about their relationship with Hamas, he adds.One image - which has not yet been verified by the BBC - shows men blindfolded, kneeling in what appears to be a large pit of bulldozed sand.The 22-year-old says the place that he, his father, brother and five cousins were taken to was sandy - and they were left there almost naked but given a blanket at night. After questioning, he says he was taken to another location before being told to go home, arriving at around 01:40 in the morning."They released all of us, except my father and eldest cousin. My father works for UNRWA. I don't know why they took him," he said."We walked barefoot down the street in the dark, with the roads full of rocks and glass."UNRWA is the UN agency that supports Palestinian refugees.Mr Regev said IDF troops had been gathering people to find out who was responsible for the Hamas attacks in Israel. They were trying to determine "whose name and face fits with the photographs of people beheading people, or raping women and so forth", he said.Mr Regev claimed it was possible that some were UN workers, but suggested that did not "automatically" mean they were not also Hamas members.He said Hamas controlled the workers' union of UNRWA and that the group had "activists in all sorts of organisations, that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone".Juliette Touma, UNRWA director of communications, told the BBC that the agency "has a scrutiny and screening process for all its staff" which it shares "with the host governments where we work"."For Gaza and the West Bank, UNRWA also shares these lists with the government of Israel as the occupying power," she said.  UNRWA has never received a response from Israel to these lists, she added.A second Palestinian, Mohammed Lubbad, who lives in Belgium, said on Instagram that his brother Ibrahim was detained along with 10 other family members.Mr Lubbad told the BBC he had video-called his brother on WhatsApp two hours before he was taken away."He told me that our house and the entire village in Beit Lahia were surrounded by Israeli forces," he said. "Later, I saw the video posted on social media [of the truck]. I immediately recognised my brother and also identified some of our neighbours."Mr Lubbad said all his relatives were eventually released except for two cousins - Ahmed Lubbad, 35, a teacher and father-of-four, and Ayman Lubbad, a human rights activist and father-of-three.He said his family were "innocent civilians with no military affiliation". One of the detained men, Diaa al-Kahlout - who has not been released yet, according to a colleague - is a correspondent for The New Arab, or Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, a London-based pan-Arab outlet.Some of those later released told al-Kahlout's family that the journalist had been transferred to Zikim military base in Israel, according to Lamis Andoni of The New Arab."We have no idea about his fate," she told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. "The photos and videos of these men are horrifying. I'm shocked."Describing Mr al-Kahlout as very ambitious, she said he "always had a smile on his face, but like many Gazans, felt suffocated".Ms Andoni said her outlet was speaking to Israeli forces through the UN. She said the IDF's suggestion the men were just suspects and that forces needed to investigate them was "not a good answer".	
09/12/2023 09:48:00	Israel-Gaza: The status quo is smashed. The future is messy and dangerous - BBC News	At the end of the war that started on 7 October lies a big, unknown place called the future. The old status quo was dangerous and painful, especially for Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. But it was familiar. Then after 7 October it was smashed by the Hamas attacks, and Israel's response. The shock of war can speed up change, when it sweeps away old thinking, forcing difficult choices for a better future. Or it drives leaders and their citizens deeper into their bunkers, as they prepare for the next round. For more than a century, Jews and Arabs have been confronting each other, and sometimes going to war, over control of the small, highly coveted piece of land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. Perhaps the safest, saddest bet is to assume that the conflict, reshaped, will go on. After all, that is what has happened after every other Middle East war since 1948, when Israel won its independence. But there are other options. Here are some of the arguments made by individuals at the centre of events. Israel's prime minister has not spelt out his plan for the day after, if he has one. His opponents in Israel, who blame him for security and intelligence failures that made the Hamas attacks on 7 October possible, say Netanyahu's only real plan is to stay in power and avoid conviction on the serious corruption charges he faces. Netanyahu built his career on the message he was Mr Security, the only man who could keep Israel safe. Hamas shattered his brand, which was already badly damaged by political strife inside Israel. The prime minister's broad statements about what happens after the war, assuming Israel can declare victory, all point to continued occupation of Gaza. Israeli officials have reportedly talked about setting up buffer zones along the border, without offering any details. Netanyahu has rejected a role for foreign peacekeepers, assuming they can be found. Jordan's foreign minister Ayman Safadi has already said that Arab states would not "clean the mess" left by Israel. "There will be no Arab troops going to Gaza. None. We are not going to be seen as the enemy." Netanyahu has also dismissed US President Joe Biden's plan to replace Hamas with the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas. Netanyahu claims the PA cannot be trusted and supports terrorism, even though it recognises Israel and cooperates with it on security. President Biden's vision of the future is very different to Benjamin Netanyahu's. Biden continues to give considerable military, diplomatic and emotional support to Israelis. He visited, embraced the families of hostages and has ordered his diplomats at the United Nations Security Council to use the US veto to block ceasefire resolutions. Biden ordered two aircraft carrier strike groups to the region and has sent Israel vast amounts of weaponry. In return, the US president wants Israel to return to some kind of revitalised peace process. He wants the Palestinian Authority (PA) eventually to run Gaza while Israel agrees arrangements for an independent Palestine alongside Israel. The Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas agrees. He has largely been a bystander since 7 October. In a rare interview this week, with Reuters, he said there should be a peace conference after the war to work out a political solution that would lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state. The "two state solution" has been the official objective of America and its western allies since the early 1990s. Years of negotiations to make it happen failed. For almost a quarter of a century, since the peace process collapsed, the phrase has been an empty slogan. Biden wants to revive it, arguing correctly that only a political solution will end the conflict. Biden sent his vice president, Kamala Harris, to Dubai last week to make a speech laying out America's red lines for Gaza on the day after. She laid out five principles. "No forcible displacement, no re-occupation, no siege or blockade, no reduction in territory, and no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism." "We want to see a unified Gaza and West Bank under the Palestinian Authority, and Palestinian voices and aspirations must be at the centre of this work."In and out of office, Benjamin Netanyahu has worked consistently hard to thwart Palestinian independence. It is safe to say he is not about to change his mind. If the two-state solution can be revived, it won't happen while he is prime minister. I went to see Simcha Rotman at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, where he is a prominent MP for the far-right Religious Zionist Party. The government of Benjamin Netanyahu depends on the support of Rotman's party and other hard-line Jewish nationalists. Their power comes from the dynamism of the movement to settle Jews on the land captured in 1967. From that moment of victory, some Israelis were set on extending the Zionist enterprise into the newly occupied Palestinian territories: the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Since 1967 they have been highly successful, despite being forced to leave Gaza when Israel pulled out in 2005. Around 700,000 Israeli Jews now live in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Settler leaders are in the cabinet, and their enterprise is at the centre of Israeli politics. Now that Israel is fighting Hamas, vowing to smash the organisation once and for all, Jewish nationalists see the biggest opportunity they have had since 1967, when Israel beat all its Arab neighbours in a war that lasted for six days. Since 7 October, armed settlers in the West Bank, backed by soldiers and police, have prevented Palestinian farmers from harvesting their olives or tending their fields. Settlers have paved illegal roads and sought to entrench themselves even deeper by consolidating outposts that are illegal under Israeli as well as international law. Posters are everywhere demanding the return of Jewish settlers to Gaza. Settlers have also killed Palestinians and invaded their homes. Men with bulldozers came at night to destroy the tiny village of Khirbet Zanuta, near Hebron. Its population of 200 Palestinians had already left, forced out by armed and aggressive settlers. International law says an occupying power should not settle its citizens in land it has captured. Israel says the law does not apply. "Occupation is not the word," Simcha Rotman told me at the Knesset. "You cannot occupy your own land. Israel is not an occupier in Israel because that's the land of Israel." For Simcha Rotman and other Jewish nationalists, Gaza is also part of the land of Israel. "We need to make sure that the only people that are in charge of our security in the land of Israel are the IDF [Israel Defence Forces]. We cannot have any terrorist organisation, doesn't matter what its name. Would it be Hamas? Would it be Fatah? Doesn't matter. The terrorist organisation cannot have control of our lives."If there are Palestinian elections after the 7 October war ends, Mustafa Barghouti is likely to run for president. He is the secretary general of the Palestine National Initiative. It wants to be the third force in Palestinian politics, an alternative to the Islamist extremists in Hamas and to Fatah, the faction led by President Mahmoud Abbas, which it regards as corrupt and incompetent. Barghouthi believes resistance to occupation is legitimate and legal, though he wants it to be non-violent. In his office in Ramallah on the West Bank, Mustafa Barghouthi told me that Israel is using the war to deliver a crushing blow not just to Hamas but to the idea of Palestinian independence and freedom. Like many Palestinians, Barghouthi sees what's happening as a grim echo of the events of 1948 when Israel won its independence and more than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced at gunpoint to leave their homes in what became Israel. Palestinians call it al-Naqba, "the catastrophe" and believe Israel wants it to happen again. "I am 100% sure that their main goal right from the beginning was the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, complete ethnic cleansing of Gaza, trying to push people to Egypt, a terrible war crime. And if they managed to do so, I think their next goal will be to try to ethnically cleanse the West Bank and force people to join them.""If they fail to ethnically cleanse all Gazans, I am sure that Netanyahu's plan B is to annexe Gaza City and the north of Gaza completely to Israel and claim it as a security area."Barghouthi warns that Israel faces dire prospects if its troops stay in Gaza long term."Israel did that before and it didn't work. And there will be resistance to their occupation, which they cannot tolerate. And that's why Netanyahu's goal really is to ethnically cleanse people. He wants to have military control of Gaza without people. He knows very well that Gaza with people is something that is unmanageable." Barghouthi believes Gaza should be part of a democratic Palestinian state."We Palestinians are grown up people. We don't need any patronage of anybody. And no, we don't need any other country to tell us how we should rule ourselves."This crisis looks as if it will have more chapters. The US veto of the latest ceasefire resolution at the UN Security Council gives Israel more time to wage war. But that extra time is not indefinite, and continued Biden support for Israel carries a political price in America's coming election year. Influential members of his own Democratic party oppose what he's doing, and so do younger voters whose support he needs. The Biden Administration is already deeply uncomfortable that Israel is ignoring its repeated requests to protect civilians and respect the laws of war. Israel may struggle to achieve the crushing victory Benjamin Netanyahu has promised. He set a high bar for victory; not just annihilating Hamas as a military force, but also destroying its capacity to govern. Israel's vast military power, reinforced by American resupply, has not yet destroyed the capacity of Hamas to fight. The Hamas creed of Islamist nationalism is also embedded in the minds of many Palestinians. Guns often don't kill ideas but reinforce them. The future is messy and dangerous. The war in Gaza will not end neatly. 	
08/12/2023 22:08:00	Hamas claims Israeli operation ended in hostage death - BBC News	The armed wing of Hamas has released a video which it says shows the bloody aftermath of a failed Israeli operation to free an Israeli hostage.In the footage, a man says he has been held for 40 days, suggesting the video may have been recorded in mid-November.A lot of blood is seen on a tiled floor, as well as military equipment, which Hamas claims to have captured. The video ends with gruesome images of a bloodied body that appears to be that of the same hostage seen earlier.We are withholding the man's name - he says this and his age in the video. A script in Arabic says that Israeli soldiers "failed to reach" the hostage, leading to his death, and that the Israeli team "quickly fled the place". It claims that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) used an ambulance to reach the place where the hostage was being held. The BBC has not verified the video and has no confirmation of the claims made by Hamas in it.At a briefing on Friday evening, chief IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari confirmed that two Israeli soldiers were seriously wounded during operations in Gaza to free hostages. He said "terrorists who participated in the kidnapping and holding of hostages" had been killed, but he said no hostages had been released.It is not clear if he was talking about the same incident described in the Hamas video or something else.The IDF launched its military operation in Gaza after a deadly Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October.Israel says 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage in the Hamas attack. A number of hostages were later released during a short-lived ceasefire - but not those who Hamas claims to be linked to the Israeli military.Hamas says Israel has killed more than 17,177 people in its retaliatory campaign, including about 7,000 children.	
08/12/2023 20:54:00	Bowen: US uses veto but pressure for Gaza ceasefire is building - BBC News	UN secretary general António Guterres has spoken about the "serious risk to the maintenance of international peace and security" in the Gaza conflict, citing the spillover of hostilities in "the occupied West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen".He triggered Article 99, prompting a UN Security Council vote on Friday, because he believes this is a very urgent matter which must be brought to the attention of the council. The Israeli government detests the UN and they detest the secretary general. The Israelis rejected his description, claiming Mr Guterres is in fact the threat to world peace because he is pandering to Hamas by trying to end the fighting now, before their mission to destroy the group has been concluded. That ill-feeling will not have improved after the secretary general also mentioned that one of the risks is that the situation in Gaza could get so bad that there would be a mass displacement of Palestinians over the border into Egypt - which is also of huge concern to the Egyptian government. There was, Mr Guterres said, a high risk of the "total collapse of the humanitarian support system in Gaza". And the Palestinians say that is exactly what Israel wants because it wants to get all Palestinians out of Gaza. Journalists are not permitted by Israel to enter Gaza so I can't report from there myself, but what the secretary general is saying sounds pretty accurate from the pictures and video we can see and the people we speak to. By all the measures you can think of, the situation there for civilians is absolutely catastrophic, as they are subjected to a remorseless military campaign. Israel says they are doing what they can to save civilian lives but insists Hamas holds responsibility for using them as human shields.At the UN, the Americans duly vetoed this resolution calling for a ceasefire. For those concerned about the significant loss of life, that does sound a bit hollow - the Americans claim the Israelis are saying they will stick to the rules of war and avoid unnecessary civilian deaths. But, they say, there is a gap between what Israel says and what it does. I think the strategy behind the secretary general's decision to bring a vote - which he knew would probably get vetoed - was to hurry up the inevitable moment when the Americans will say to Israel: "Enough is enough, you've had enough time and killed enough people and it's time for a ceasefire."Some diplomats I have spoken to have said they might give the Israelis another month - I think Mr Guterres's strategy is to try and shorten that, partly by increasing international pressure and also partly by shaming the Americans into thinking that they cannot continue to hold this position as it becomes less and less tenable. That pressure has also increased today with the publication of footage of prisoners in Gaza, held by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), stripped to their underwear and being driven away in trucks. It's a cruel image of war seeing these men, which local reports on social media suggest could be as many as 700. Those same sources, including family of some of the men, say that they were taken from a UN school where they were sheltering, and where others tried to get away and were killed. A horrendous video circulated yesterday of six people lying dead in the street - said to be from that same area and near that same school - and one of them was a bloody corpse lying on top of a white flag he had apparently been carrying. The IDF say they are trying to work out who is a suspect and who is responsible for those terrible attacks on 7 October - and that they are all the while observing the international law on conflict. But for those who have little sympathy for what Israel is doing, or have lost sympathy because of the level of killing that has been carried out in Gaza, those people are saying that this is another sign of Israeli indifference to the dignity and the health of Palestinians. The weather is chilly here now, so being forced to walk around in underwear in streets, some blindfolded as we saw in the video, and some with their hands tied behind their back, is undoubtedly unpleasant. The Israelis say they can't avoid it - others say it's pretty savage.	
08/12/2023 19:38:00	Images show major damage to Gaza's oldest mosque - BBC News	Footage has emerged showing extensive damage to Gaza's oldest mosque, with Hamas accusing the Israeli military for bombing the site.In the video, verified by the BBC, much of the Great Omari Mosque appears to be reduced to rubble, with only its minaret still intact.Hamas officials accused Israel of committing a "heinous, barbaric crime". The Israeli military has not commented.The mosque opened in the 7th Century on the site of a Byzantine church.Located in Gaza City's old town, the mosque was destroyed several times in various conflicts and once by an earthquake, but was rebuilt each time.It is named after Omar, Islam's second caliph.Gaza's Hamas-run antiquities ministry has accused Israel of bombing the enclave's historical and archaeological sites, urging the UN's cultural agency Unesco to help protect such sites.Israel has accused Hamas of using mosques, schools and other civilian infrastructure to hide its fighters.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched its military operation in Gaza after a deadly Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October.Israel says 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage in the Hamas attack. A number of hostages were later released during a short-lived ceasefire.Hamas says Israel has killed more than 17,177 people in its retaliatory campaign, including about 7,000 children.	
08/12/2023 19:19:00	Refaat Alareer: Palestinians mourn writer killed in air strike - BBC News	Palestinians are mourning the death of well-known writer and literary scholar Refaat Alareer, who was killed in an air strike in Gaza City on Wednesday.Alareer's father-in-law said he had died along with his brother and sister and four of her children.He taught English literature at Gaza's Islamic University."My heart is broken, my friend and colleague Refaat Alareer was killed with his family," Gazan poet Mosab Abu Toha wrote on social media.Alareer had declined to leave northern Gaza following the start of Israeli operations in the area. Two days before he died he posted video to social media in which a number of explosions could be heard."The building is shaking. The debris and shrapnel are hitting the walls and flying in the streets," he wrote.In an interview with the BBC in the hours after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel, Alareer caused widespread offence by calling it "legitimate and moral". He said it was "exactly like the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising".The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was a revolt that took place in German-occupied Poland in 1943 and saw Jews use weapons smuggled into the ghetto to try to resist Nazi efforts to transport people to the extermination camps.Alareer was one of the founders of "We Are Not Numbers", a Palestinian non-profit set up in 2015 that joined writers from around the world with young people in Gaza to "tell the stories behind the numbers of Palestinians in the news".He was the co-editor of the book, Gaza Unsilenced, and the editor of Gaza Writes Back: Short Stories from Young Writers in Gaza, Palestine.Paying tribute on social media, former student Jehad Abusalim described Alareer as a mentor and friend who had "truly cared about his students beyond the classroom". Alareer, he added, taught him English and viewed the language as a "way to break free from Gaza's prolonged siege, a teleportation device that defied Israel's fences and the intellectual, academic, and cultural blockade of Gaza".He was "full of energy, life & humour. He loved Chicago Pizza, cats, history, classic music, theatre, poetry & Harry Potter," said Muhammad Shehada, a Gazan writer and communications chief at Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor.He was described as "one of the kindest, most generous, committed, wonderful human beings I ever met", by Palestinian-American author and activist Susan Abulhawa in a video posted on social media."Rest in peace, Refaat Alareer. We will continue to be guided by your wisdom, now and forever," Palestinian-American author and journalist Ramzy Baroud wrote.In a poem posted on X, formerly Twitter, on 1 November, Alareer wrote: "If I must die, let it bring hope, let it be a tale". The post has been shared tens of thousands of times.Israel destroyed the Islamic University at which Alareer taught on 11 October, saying it was an "important Hamas operational, political and military centre in Gaza".Following the outcry over Alareer's interview in October, a BBC spokesperson said: "We reported the Hamas attacks and the response by Israel in line with the BBC's Editorial Guidelines."We have included contributors who have condemned the attackers as terrorists and we have reported that Hamas is designated as a terrorist group by many Western governments, including the UK."While an interviewee who made comments on the Warsaw Ghetto was robustly challenged on air, we agree his comments were offensive and we don't intend to use him again."In the 7 October attack, Hamas killed around 1,200 people and took 240 hostages, some of whom were released during a short-lived truce at the end of November.Hamas officials in Gaza say Israel has killed more than 17,177 people in its retaliatory campaign, including about 7,000 children.Update: An earlier version of this article described Refaat Alareer as controversial and has been amended to make clear that it was his comments about the 7 October attacks which were controversial and caused huge offence.	
08/12/2023 16:38:00	Video shows stripped Palestinian men detained in Gaza - BBC News	With fighting raging around Khan Younis and in the north of Gaza, a video has emerged on social media showing dozens of Palestinian men detained by Israel.The footage, verified by the BBC, shows them stripped to their underwear, kneeling on the ground and being guarded by Israeli soldiers.The men are thought to have been arrested in Beit Lahia, in the far north of the Gaza strip.The BBC has been told some of the men have since been released.One of the men identified as having been detained is a well-known Palestinian journalist, leading his employers to accuse Israel of carrying out "invasive searches and humiliating treatment" of civilians. Asked about the video, a spokesman for the Israeli government told the BBC the men detained were all of military age and had been "discovered in areas that civilians were supposed to have evacuated weeks ago".In the video, dozens of men are lined up on a pavement and appear to have been told to remove their shoes, which are scattered across the road. Israeli soldiers and armoured vehicles are standing guard over them. Other images show them being transported in military trucks. In the Israeli media, the captives are being described as Hamas fighters who have surrendered.Another image -  which has not yet been verified by the BBC - shows men blindfolded, kneeling in what appears to be a large pit of bulldozed sand.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has not directly commented on the images, but spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Thursday that "IDF fighters and Shin Bet officers detained and interrogated hundreds of terror suspects". "Many of them also turned themselves in to our forces during the past 24 hours. The intelligence coming out of their interrogations is utilised to continue the fighting."On Friday, Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy told the BBC the men had been detained in Jabalia and Shejaiya in northern Gaza, which he described as "Hamas strongholds and centres of gravity"."We're talking about military age men who were discovered in areas that civilians were supposed to have evacuated weeks ago," he said.Mr Levy added that they would be questioned to "work out who indeed was a Hamas terrorist and who is not". He emphasised the detained men had been found in areas where Israeli forces had engaged in "close-quarter combat" with Hamas. They had been "deliberately disguising themselves as civilians" and operating from civilian buildings.  The BBC has spoken to a man who says 10 of his cousins were part of the group detained by the Israeli army on Thursday in Beit Lahia. The man - who wishes to remain anonymous over safety concerns - told BBC Arabic's Ethar Shalaby that IDF soldiers entered the area and used megaphones to order the men from their homes and UN relief agency (UNRWA) schools. The IDF ordered women in the area to go to a nearby hospital and later threated to shoot them if the men did not come out of their homes, he said. The man said seven of his cousins have since been released and have returned home, but added he does not know about the fate of the three who remain in Israeli detention.In a post on social media, the Palestinian ambassador to the UK described the footage as "savage images of Israeli occupation forces detaining and stripping civilians taken from a UN shelter"."This evokes some of humanity's darkest passages of history," Husam Zomlot said.Palestinian journalist, Diaa al-Kahlout, a correspondent for al-Araby al-Jadeed, has been identified among those who were in the video of the detainees.The Arabic language news outlet, which also publishes in English under the name the New Arab, said Mr al-Kahlout had been arrested along with his brothers, relatives and "other civilians" by Israeli forces in Beit Lahia.Al-Araby al-Jadeed has condemned what it describes as the "humiliating" detention of Mr al-Kahlout on Thursday.It added that soldiers forced the men to remove their clothes and "subjected them to invasive searches and humiliating treatment upon their arrest, prior to transporting them to undisclosed locations".The outlet "urges the international community, journalists' rights defenders and watchdogs, and human rights bodies to denounce this ongoing assault" by Israel on journalists in the territory.A colleague of Mr al-Kahlout, Palestinian journalist Lamis Andoni, told Radio 4's PM programme on Friday that a number of prisoner had been released - but not Mr al-Kahlout.Ms Andoni said those freed told Mr Kahlout's family that he had been transferred to Zikim military base in Israel. The BBC has not verified this claim."We have no idea about his fate. The photos and videos of these men is horrifying. I'm shocked," she said, adding that her media outlet was liaising with Israeli forces via the UN.Additional reporting by Paul Brown, Peter Mwai and Alex Murray	
08/12/2023 06:15:00	Israel-Gaza: London couple traumatised after fleeing West Bank - BBC News	A couple who got trapped in the West Bank as the Israel-Gaza conflict broke out say they are traumatised and afraid for their relatives who remain there.Palestinians Imad Alqasim and Zeina Ramadan, who live in London, said it took days to leave with their child.The husband and wife say they have struggled to eat and sleep since returning to the capital.Ms Ramadan also said she was "living in a nightmare" and felt "guilt for being able to leave".Mr Alqasim and Ms Ramadan were visiting extended family in Nablus and then travelled to Ramallah in the central west Bank.The couple were looking forward to visiting Bethlehem and Jerusalem but all this changed when news reached them that Hamas had launched an attack on Israel on 7 October.Mr Alqasim said "people started being a bit terrified" and taxi drivers advised them not to travel because "it was not safe", so they cancelled their trip to Bethlehem and remained in Ramallah hoping things would improve.Instead the situation became worse."I didn't leave the home at all and someone came and brought food to the place we were in because we couldn't actually move."Mr Alqasim and Ms Ramadan decided to cancel their other trips and "leave as quick as possible" once the border reopened.However, the couple realised Ms Ramadan could not return to London initially as she is a Palestinian citizen unlike Mr Alqasim, who has British citizenship.He said it was "a hard decision" to leave his wife and child behind, something he later regretted."I thought if I was outside I could be a little bit more helpful in trying to get her out," said Imad.Ms Ramadan said although she grew up in the area and was familiar with it, having her baby daughter with her made her feel more vulnerable."No-one knew if the road was safe, [my husband] was asking the driver if that road was safe and he was saying 'we don't know - we don't know if the road is open, we don't know if the road is safe'," she said.Mr Alqasim managed to cross the border to Amman in Jordan, while Ms Ramadan returned to Nablus, which she said was under siege and officially announced as a closed area by the Israeli army.When she and their daughter finally made it to Amman two days later they flew back to the UK, arriving in London on 13 October but their ordeal is still continuing as they process being apart from their relatives in the West Bank."It was the hardest thing I've ever been through, Ms Ramadan said, adding: "We weren't eating properly, we weren't sleeping properly.""Part of my brain was trying to function - what happened, how we were separated for a while as a family, how I made a decision to leave."I felt guilty for being able to leave... I still feel this guilt."She continued: "Seeing people in the streets; of course they're living their normal lives but something shifted in my head. "It makes you feel unreal, it makes you feel like, 'I'm living in a nightmare, this is not real'.Even though almost every generation of her family have lived through periods of conflict and the trio are physically safe in London, Zeina said she doesn't "feel safe"."When you start your day you need some time to try to understand that you're not there and there's nothing you can do about it except to move on with your life.""There is a collective grief, but we don't even have time to grieve. It doesn't stop," she explained."There are some moments where you break down with even minor things. There's a lot of talk about post-traumatic [stress] but there is no post, there is no post... because that has been my whole life," she said through tears."I just want things to be over and then we can think about grief," Ms Ramadan said. "I need to be strong for [my daughter]."Additional reporting by Alice Bhandhukravi.Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

08/12/2023 05:25:00	Qatar: Indian ambassador meets eight ex-naval officers on death row - BBC News	India's ambassador to Qatar has met eight former naval officers who have been sentenced to death in Qatar on unspecified charges.An Indian foreign ministry spokesperson said that the diplomat met the men in prison on 3 December.He added that a court in Qatar has held two hearings on an appeal filed by India against the verdict and a third hearing will be held soon.The Court of First Instance of Qatar sentenced the men to death in October.India had said then that it was "deeply shocked" and would explore all legal options.The court order has not been made public and both countries have not revealed the specific charges against the men. The Financial Times has reported, quoting an unnamed person briefed on the case, that the men have been "charged with spying for Israel". Arindam Bagchi, spokesperson for India's ministry of external affairs, said in a briefing on Thursday that the court order was "confidential" and "has only been shared with the legal team". He also asked people "not to engage in speculation" given the sensitivity of the case.Two days before the ambassador visited the men, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had met the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, on the sidelines of the COP28 summit in Dubai. Mr Modi said on X (formerly Twitter) that the two leaders had discussed issues including "the well-being of the Indian community in Qatar".The Indian government has said that the eight men were employees of a private company called Al Dahra, but they have been widely reported to be former personnel of the Indian Navy. Last year, in parliament, foreign minister S Jaishankar described them as "ex-servicemen" of the country. The families of some of the men have also confirmed their identities and background in the Navy to local media.Their arrest in August last year had made front-page headlines in India, but there has been little confirmed information about the case against them.More than 700,000 Indians live in Qatar and the two countries share cordial relations. But political observers are closely watching the outcome of this case, and some have termed it a test for India's diplomatic abilities. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

"I'm fighting to be good," she tells me. "I'm fighting to stay moral when both sides are in such terrible pain. I'm fighting to be the same person I was before." Yael heads a charity called Road to Recovery, a group of Israeli volunteers who drive sick Palestinians - mostly children - from checkpoints in the occupied West Bank and Gaza to hospital appointments in Israel. Or did.The 1,000 or so volunteers can no longer take patients from Gaza, which is governed by Hamas. And four of them are dead - murdered as Palestinian gunmen stormed through their kibbutzim in southern Israel. They include Vivian Silver, a renowned peace activist; Adi Dagan, who Yael describes as "funny" and always ready to step in and ferry patients at short notice in his big car; Tammy Suchman, a much-loved grandmother; and Eli Or-Gad, who loved talking about poetry. Four other volunteers lost close family members on 7 October.About 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas attack on Israel. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 17,177 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive which followed.Yael lives in northern Israel, but her parents are from kibbutz Alumim, one of the southern communities which was attacked - and they cowered as the assault unfolded, hour after terrifying hour. Two of her nephews have been fighting in Gaza, in Israel's military response.    In the immediate aftermath of 7 October, Yael says she was so shaken that she could barely breathe. "Something was broken in my heart and I said that I would never talk to people in Gaza again," she tells me.But after a few days, she decided that she couldn't allow the atrocities to change her. She and most of the Road to Recovery volunteers have continued to drive Palestinians from the West Bank to hospitals in Israel for cancer treatment, organ transplants and kidney dialysis. As soon as she can, she says she'll go and collect patients from Gaza again. Yael refuses to dehumanise them, or equate them with Hamas, which is classed as a terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries."Like us they are victims of Hamas, so I think we should keep on helping them, because it's not their fault," she tells me over the phone. "We can't refuse to help a child with cancer. Our neighbours need help, so we need to help them."She worries for the families she knows in Gaza, with winter approaching and so many bombed houses now uninhabitable.  The parent of a 6-year-old child, who'd had an organ transplant, texted one of the Road to Recovery volunteers saying simply: "We are okay. We are going to die here."Yael is also desperately concerned for two Road to Recovery volunteers, Oded Lifschitz and Chaim Peri, who are still being held hostage by Hamas.   Emotionally, she feels like she's being torn apart. She has uncles and cousins who are adamantly opposed to what she's doing and accuse her of helping Hamas. And it's not just family members who disapprove."When I'm driving with Palestinians through checkpoints in the West Bank, soldiers have asked me how I can do what I'm doing," she tells me. "Other people ask the same question.""It's dangerous now to even talk about the suffering of the kids in Gaza - people look at me like I'm the enemy," she says, through sobs. "But I'm not doing it for the Palestinians, I'm doing it because I want to be proud to be Israeli. I believe that whether you're an Israeli or a Palestinian, a Jew or an Arab, people are people."Some Palestinian families have reached out to find out how she is. But it's harder than ever now for those few people swimming against the tide by trying to bridge the divide between Israelis and Palestinians."Even people on the left say that we should flatten Gaza. Both sides have become more and more radicalised," Yael says. "I really don't know what will happen in the future. But I know that both of us will still live here, so we must find a solution."Since 7 October, some Road to Recovery volunteers have dropped out of driving altogether or decided to focus on taking medicines to displaced Israelis instead, while the war lasts.But other volunteers have stepped in, to make sure that sick Palestinians from the West Bank still get to appointments that are saving their lives.Yael says the charity will need support from the outside world to keep going because donations from within Israel have virtually stopped.But she is sure that, when it becomes possible, Road to Recovery will be collecting child patients from Gaza again - hoping that they will all have survived."It may be hard.  But we can't stop," she says. "It's my mission and I have to do it."

07/12/2023 20:29:00	Issam Abdallah: Rights groups want Israel investigated over killed journalist - BBC News	Rights groups say Israel should be investigated for a possible war crime over the death of a journalist in Lebanon in October.Reuters reporter Issam Abdallah, 37, died in two apparent strikes across the Israel-Lebanon border in October. Six others were wounded.Amnesty and Human Rights Watch (HRW) said investigations showed the journalists were probably fired on deliberately by an Israeli tank crew. Israel denies targeting the reporters. "We do not target civilians," Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy said when asked about the reports from Amnesty and HRW."We've been doing everything possible to get civilians out of harm's way," Eylon added in a televised briefing. The group of seven journalists from Reuters, Al-Jazeera and AFP, were filming about 1km from the Lebanon-Israel border on 13 October. Amnesty said images showed the journalists were wearing body armour marked with the word "PRESS", and the Reuters crew car was marked "TV" with yellow tape on its bonnet.They were on a hilltop in an open area with no tree cover or other buildings to obscure them from nearby Israeli military outposts, Reuters said. Drones had been overhead and an Israeli helicopter had been patrolling, it said.Abdallah was killed instantly in the strike. Two more Reuters journalists, two from AFP and two from Al Jazeera were all wounded. AFP photographer Christina Assi, 28, later had a leg amputated and is still in hospital. Amnesty's deputy regional director Aya Majzoub said the organisation's investigation indicated it was "likely a direct attack on civilians" and should be "investigated as a war crime"."Those responsible for Issam Abdallah's unlawful killing and the injuring of six other journalists must be held accountable," Majzoub added. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the strikes "were apparently deliberate attacks on civilians, which is a war crime". The group said its investigation showed the journalists were "well removed from ongoing hostilities, clearly identifiable as members of the media, and had been stationary for at least 75 minutes before they were hit".Separately, Israel Defense Force (IDF) spokesperson Richard Hecht said the military did not target journalists when Reuters presented him with its own findings on the incident. The Israeli prime minister's office did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.AFP's global news director also said the agency had shared its latest findings with the Israeli military but had not received a response. Sixty-three journalists have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Committee to Protect journalists.	
07/12/2023 19:16:00	Israel war cabinet minister's son killed in Gaza fighting - BBC News	The son of Israel's ex-army chief Gadi Eisenkot, who is currently a minister in the country's war cabinet, has been killed in Gaza, the military says.It says 25-year-old Master Sergeant Gal Eisenkot died in northern Gaza on Thursday.Israeli media say MSgt Eisenkot was badly injured after a tunnel shaft exploded and later died in hospital.PM Benjamin Netanyahu said he and his wife were "broken-hearted", and that Gal Eisenkot was a "true hero".In his statement, Mr Netanyahu added: "Our heroes have not fallen in vain. We will continue to fight until victory."Gadi Eisenkot, 63, is a battle-hardened retired general who served as Israel's chief of the general staff from 2015-19.A lawmaker from the National Unity party, he is also a current member of Mr Netanyahu's emergency government set up after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.Israel has responded by bombarding Gaza from the air and launching a ground invasion. Hamas officials in Gaza say it has killed more than 17,000 people, mainly civilians, with thousands more missing under rubble.Mr Eisenkot was informed about his son's injuries as he was visiting the Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) Southern Command, local media reported.A number of Israeli government officials and lawmakers also sent their condolences to the Eisenkot family.Opposition leader Yair Lapid posted a photo of Gal and Gadi Eisenkot in military uniforms hugging each other. "This photo. This hug. A father and his son. Both in uniform. Both soldiers in this country," Mr Lapid wrote. "They both respond to the call and show up when they're needed, doing whatever they need to do. The fate of an entire nation in one hug."The IDF also said that another soldier - named as Sgt Maj Jonathan David Deitch, 34 - was killed in southern Gaza on Thursday.	
07/12/2023 16:24:00	Jewish Londoners suffer 'worst two months' - BBC News	Dr Elliot Sorene and his Israeli-born wife Merav are lighting candles at their north London home, bringing in the Jewish festival of Chanukah, having experienced what they call “the worst two months of their lives”.For Dr Sorene, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, the 7 October Hamas attacks were particularly personal as his son Ariel was caught up in the Supernova massacre, where 365 attendees were killed, hundreds wounded and 40 kidnapped at a rave.Ariel - who has dual British-Israeli citizenship - heard rockets while at the trance party in southern Israel - before seeing militants shoot indiscriminately at the partygoers.Dr Sorene said: “It was horrific. My son nearly died. He was shot at and ran to safety. Some of his friends didn’t make it. I’m so thankful he’s alive.”As is the case with many in the capital - which has the UK's largest Jewish community - the Sorenes have numerous connections with those affected directly by the latest wave of violence.Dr Sorene, who spent years living and working in Israel including as a hospital surgeon, says he has lost friends who were killed by Hamas.“These last two months have been the worst two months of our lives; we’ve been racked with worry about what’s going on in Israel and we’ve also seen a horrendous uptick in London of antisemitic incidents, where Jews don’t currently feel safe.”The Sorenes have three daughters who go to a London Jewish school. Since 7 October, they have become increasingly worried about a spike in antisemitism in London including cases of harassment, violence and schools being targeted, along with instances of antisemitism associated with the weekly pro-Palestinian marches in the capital.“We don't know what’s going to be. It all feels very unsafe. I'm worried about my daughters who speak Hebrew at home, so I ask them not to speak Hebrew outside," says Merav Sorene, who is an aesthetic nurse.“I wear my Magen David (Star of David) under my shirt, and I'm very conscious about that. And it's suddenly things have been very abnormal living in London.”The Metropolitan Police said it had scaled up its visible presence since the Gaza war began, amid a significant increase in Islamophobia and antisemitism.In the period between the Hamas attack and 27 October, the Community Security Trust, a British charity, said it had recorded 805 antisemitic acts, the highest number in a three-week period since it began documenting episodes of this kind in 1984. Dr Sorene says he has personally experienced abuse since 7 October.“I’ve been called a Christ killer, a baby killer. I've been told people [are] proudly supporting Hamas, supporting their terror attack, supporting what happened on the 7th of October. “I was born in this country, have lived here all my life; my father fought in the Second World War for the British army. We have always contributed to British society. Now we feel hatred and violence towards us.”

Other demonstrations are also being held at defence factories in Brighton, Lancashire and at BAE Govan, Glasgow.The group said it had more than 600 people at the protest including health workers, teachers, hospitality workers, academics and artists.The demonstrators are urging the firm and other companies to end their ties with Israel and cease all weapons, defence and supplies trading with them.Protesters were seen holding a banner saying: "Weapons made here kill in Gaza."Mesh, a junior doctor who did not want to give his surname, said: "I felt compelled as a health worker to stand in solidarity with healthcare workers in Gaza... by trying to stop the UK arming of Israel."Emergency department doctor, Harriet, who also did not want to give her surname, said: "It's heartbreaking, we feel helpless as a profession. "We come to work every day and you can see people becoming more and more broken by it."Dorset Police said it was aware of the protest and officers were "at the scene liaising with the organisers to ensure people can exercise their right to protest legally and safely without causing significant or ongoing disruption"."We respect people's right to lawful protest and will seek to facilitate a peaceful protest, but public order or criminal offences will not be tolerated and will be dealt with robustly," the force added.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

07/12/2023 14:19:00	Gaza protesters block BAE Systems aerospace factory in Lancashire - BBC News	Protesters have blocked an aerospace factory to call against the production of fighter jets which they say are being used in the Israel-Gaza war.Workers for a Free Palestine gathered outside BAE Systems in Samlesbury, Lancashire.  Similar protests have been held at BAE in Glasgow, Wimborne and Brighton.BAE Systems said the firm "respected everyone's right to protest peacefully" and was "horrified by the situation in Israel and Gaza".About 200 protesters held a banner calling for the firm to "stop arming Israel", while blocking cars from entering the Lancashire factory, where military aircraft parts are manufactured.Cameron Stocks from Manchester was one of those who arrived at about 07:00 GMT for the protest.He said they were opposed to the production of the F-35 fighter jet parts at the Lancashire factory, which he believed was being used by the Israeli military in Gaza.He said the campaign had "widespread support", adding "people are here from Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Lancaster, and Preston.""This factory produces rear fuselage for every single F-35 stealth fighter in the world, the main combat plane used in Gaza," Mr Stocks said."The British Government may have control over export licences, but we as workers are opposed to the continued production of these planes and their use by Israel."A spokesman from BAE Systems said the factory operated under "the tightest regulation", and complied "fully with all applicable defence export controls, which are subject to ongoing assessment."About 3,000 people are employed at Samlesbury, manufacturing fuselage and components for military aircraft.The demonstrators are urging the firm and other companies to end their ties with Israel and cease all weapons, defence and supplies trading with them.Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

07/12/2023 13:41:00	Kenya follows Malawi in sending farm workers to Israel amid Hamas war - BBC News	Kenya is sending 1,500 farm workers to Israel, the labour ministry has said.The announcement comes nearly two weeks after Malawi sent 221 young people to work on Israeli farms, triggering a backlash against the government there.The casual workers will be deployed on three-year renewable contracts, "with a guaranteed net [monthly] income" of $1,500 (£1,195), Kenya said.Israel has turned to Africa to fill a severe labour gap on its farms, after a mass exit of foreign workers.More than 10,000 migrant farm workers - mostly Thailand nationals - have left Israel since the start of the war with Hamas in early October.Israel has also barred Palestinian workers, who made up nearly 20% of the agricultural labour force prior to the war.Israel's ambassador in Kenya, Michael Lotem, told the BBC that Israel was planning to recruit farm workers from Uganda as well, while recruitment in Tanzania had already started.  "We are looking to East Africa to fill the labour gap as we have had student internships programmes in place for many years with these countries and it has been a good experience," Mr Lotem said.He added that the labour shortage had been caused by the fact that an estimated 360,000 Israeli reservists have been called up for military service since the war started. He did not cite work restrictions on Palestinians or the departure of foreign nationals as the reasons for the shortage.Israel's agriculture ministry told CNN last week that the country needed 30-40,000 farm workers.The announcement has sparked mixed reactions in Kenya, with some concerned about the workers' safety.At least 32 Thai farm workers were killed and several others taken hostage when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October.Tanzanian student Clemence Felix Mtenga - who was in Israel as an agriculture intern - was also killed in the attack, while another Tanzanian student, Joshua Loitu Mollel, is still missing. Critics have also questioned the conditions the workers will face in Israel.In 2018, a BBC investigation found that many migrant farm workers in Israel were subject to unsafe working practices and squalid, unsanitary living conditions. Some were overworked, others underpaid, and there were dozens of unexplained deaths.Rights groups like Human Rights Watch have also previously raised the alarm over Israel's treatment of foreign farm labourers.At the time Israel denied the accusations and has since said that foreign workers enjoyed the same employment rights as Israeli citizens.Mr Lotem said extra measures have since been put in place to ensure foreign workers are treated fairly and that any foreign worker can now file a complaint which will be quickly tracked.Some Kenyans have supported the deal, saying it provides badly needed jobs at a time when Kenya is battling an unemployment crisis and the rising cost of living.Kenya has an unemployment rate of 5.5%, according to the World Bank.Malawi's government has also announced that it will send 5,000 more young people to work on Israeli farms, rejecting calls to drop the plan."People are going out of desperation," said William Kambwandira, the executive director at the Centre for Social Accountability and Transparency, a workers' rights watchdog based in the capital Lilongwe."Given that the war is happening, we are concerned about the welfare of these young men and women," he added.However, Mr Lotem told the BBC that the farm workers would not be placed in areas close to the conflict, and they would have the same protection as Israelis.The promise of a secure job and higher salary has pushed safety worries aside for many of the Malawian workers going to Israel.Andrew Chunga, 27, was part of the first group of 221 Malawians who took up jobs in Israel last month. He is currently living in a two-bedroom house with two other Malawians on a farm in Gefen in central Israel, and has spent the first week removing weeds. "This is all about money. I am here for greener pastures."When I go home, I will be a millionaire," Mr Chunga said laughing. Jamison Kupatamoyo, 27, is another Malawian who has been working in Israel since last month. He said he was thrilled to get the job as it will help him gain agriculture training and send a good wage back to his family. "I'll be in Israel for five years but will go back to Malawi every year for a holiday," Mr Kupatamoyo told the BBC. "There is unemployment in Malawi, and the salaries are low [there], compared to here in Israel," he added.Asked if he was worried for his personal safety, Mr Kupatamoyo replied: "I was already aware about the conflict in Israel, but there is a lot of fake news on social media. "It is only small parts of Israel that are affected - not the whole country." Mr Kupatamoyo said his employment agency had talked to him about the conflict."They explained everything about the war and assured us that where we are going is a safe place and we have witnessed that so far."A 31-year-old man in Lilongwe told the BBC he would be travelling to Israel soon to take up a job after being unemployed for four years. "My email address has more than 300 sent messages applying for jobs. I have diploma and a bachelor's degree," said Alex, who asked for his surname to be withheld. He does have some safety concerns. "We have been assured that the conflict has nothing to do with us. They told us about security measures like missiles detectors and safe houses."

07/12/2023 07:50:00	Ukraine aid from US in doubt after failed Senate vote - BBC News	Senate Republicans have blocked a move to pass an aid bill for Ukraine after failing to secure border compromises they sought in exchange. The $110bn (£87.3bn) package included $61bn for Ukraine, as well as funds for Israel and aid for Gaza.The White House has warned that US funds for Ukraine could soon run out.A Ukrainian official said that failure to secure more US aid would mean a "very high possibility" that the war will be lost to Russia.While Republican members are generally in favour of aid to Ukraine, some have sought to use the issue as a way to address mounting domestic concerns over the US southern border.Senators - including every single Republican - voted 51 to 49 against advancing the bill, with 60 votes needed. The vote throws uncertainty into the future of aid for Ukraine and sends lawmakers back to the negotiating table just days before Congress has scheduled its winter break. Republicans are insisting that any aid to Ukraine be tied to sweeping US immigration and asylum reforms.Earlier on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden said he was "willing to make significant compromises on the border" in order to get the aid bill passed. "This cannot wait," he said, adding that "Republicans in Congress are willing to give Putin the greatest gift he could hope for".Also on Wednesday, the Biden administration announced $175m in new security assistance for Ukraine from the supply of funding that has already been approved. The package includes ammunition, including missiles and artillery shells, as well as "equipment to protect critical national infrastructure", the US Department of Defense said in a news release.Concerns over the future of the $110bn package grew on Tuesday after a classified briefing for lawmakers aimed at shoring up support for new funds broke down spectacularly. Senators shouted at each other over border security and at least a dozen Republicans walked out. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also cancelled a virtual briefing with lawmakers over a "last-minute matter", Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday, without providing further detail.The package already includes provisions for border security, but Republican demands for additional changes to asylum rules has complicated negotiations with Democrats. Ahead of the failed vote to bring the package to the floor, Mr Schumer delivered an emotional plea to his colleagues on the Senate floor, telling them that the vote was an important "moment in history" and that they should "rush to the defence of democracy" in Ukraine. "You can be sure that Vladimir Putin is watching closely," he said. On Tuesday, the head of Ukraine's presidential office, Andriy Yermak, told an audience at the US Institute of Peace that a failure to secure more US aid would mean a "very high possibility" that the war will be lost and that it will be "impossible to continue to liberate" Russian-held areas. In Ukraine, dimming prospects for additional aid have led to a darkening mood among some parts of the population. "Of course we need support, we are protecting the whole of Europe," Tetyana, a Kyiv resident whose son is on the frontline, told the BBC this week. "We need more weapons because our children are dying."The Senate bill needed nine Republican votes to advance - a threshold that was ultimately too high. Some Democrats expressed frustration at their Republican colleagues. "The Ukrainians are on the frontlines fighting for democracy," Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren told reporters. "This is about freedom". Several Senators said that while more negotiations would follow, it is unclear whether any progress can be achieved before Congress breaks for the holidays next week. Mr Schumer, for his part, said "we'll see" when asked whether he believed Senators could come to an agreement before the break, even though he believed Mr Biden had presented a "good strong plan". One of the Republicans who opposed the package, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, said he did not believe any solution would be possible in that timeframe. Mr Graham added that he believed Mr Biden would ultimately need to negotiate more, saying that "it's going to take his leadership or we are stuck." "They know what we want," he said. "I'm hopeful we can get the border part in a place where we can go for a bill." Even if it had passed in the Senate, the package still would have faced an uphill battle in the House of Representatives. House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Tuesday that he has told the Senate he cannot pass any Ukraine aid without the inclusion of significant border security measures. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Congress has approved over $110bn in military and economic aid to Ukraine, most of which has already been distributed. In a letter to Mr Johnson released publicly earlier this week, White House budget director Shalanda Young said that the US would be unable to get more weapons and equipment to Ukraine "by the end of the year" without Congressional action.Ukrainian officials have repeatedly stressed that they see US aid as vital to the ability of the country's forces to resist the Russians and re-take occupied territory.  Another senator to vote against the aid bill was independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who had earlier in the day expressed reservations that the legislation included billions in military aid for Israel. "I do not believe we should be appropriating over $10 billion for the right-wing extremist Netanyahu government to continue its current military approach," Mr Sanders said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ongoing campaign in the Gaza strip, which has so far killed thousands of civilians. Mr Sanders, who is a long-time critic of Mr Netanyahu, added: "What the Netanyahu government is doing is immoral, it is in violation of international law, and the United States should not be complicit in those actions."(With additional reporting by Jessica Parker in Kyiv)	
07/12/2023 05:59:00	Bringing broken survivors of the Israel Nova festival attack back from darkness - BBC News	"You can cry here," the sign reads in pale blue lettering on a clean white background. Beyond it, comfortable sofas piled with cushions are screened off from the rest of the room. It's a safe, private corner where survivors of the Nova music festival can be with others who went through the same ordeal on 7 October, and get the mental health support many of them desperately need.More than 360 young partygoers were shot, beaten or burnt to death by Hamas attackers, who stormed the festival site near the Israel-Gaza perimeter fence early that morning. Another 40 were taken hostage. First, social media posts showed panicked crowds fleeing from rockets fired from Gaza and gunmen on the ground. Later, distressing videos from first responders began to confirm the scale of the massacre, as they filmed scores of murdered partygoers.In the following days, Dr Lia Naor realised that - unlike those who'd been evacuated from their nearby kibbutzim - the young people from the festival who lived through the ordeal didn't have a community already around them to give support. So she built one. "I just wanted them to be held," Dr Naor explains. "They were so fragmented and so frozen. Then there was the brokenness of faith that they that had felt - there'd been nobody there for them, not their parents, not the army, not the police. Nobody was there to save them. So the first thing was just getting them to feel secure and in a healing space." The outdoor setting in Rishpon, north of Tel Aviv, is sheltered and peaceful. The early December days have been warm in Israel, and people sit on colourful beanbags scattered across the grass. A timetable is propped up showing the range of workshops that day, from mosaic making to sound baths. There's massage, group music, and singing sessions. A few placid dogs roam through the group, waiting to be stroked or begging for food. One tiny, black-haired crossbreed chihuahua has a pair of silver wings on its back, drawing coos of appreciation. It's a different scene from the early days."Even though their bodies were whole, we saw how broken they were and that their eyes were hollow," Lia remembers. "They didn't look alive. They couldn't look at us. They would shake, they couldn't eat, they couldn't drink. The evil that these people met is incomprehensible. "I told them early on, 'As dark the darkness is that you saw, we're going to bring the light. We're going to help you believe in yourselves and in others again.'"This place is a huge collective effort, but it hasn't been driven by the state. Everybody here is a volunteer giving their time for free and hoping to heal themselves too. The homemade food spread out on low tables is donated by charities and businesses. Everyone wants to do something to help in the aftermath of one of Israel's darkest moments.Lior Gelbaum is a Nova survivor. I compliment her on the tiny jewels she's stuck under each eye, sparkling in the light, and she tells me they make her feel festive again. The 24-year-old from the city of Petah Tikva is coming here regularly to get support and give out handmade silver necklaces to others who were there that day. She remembers it well."At 06:30 in the morning, we started hearing rockets flying above our heads," she tells me. "We know the drill, so we got into our car and started driving away, but there was a traffic jam. We started hearing gunshots above our heads, so we got out and just started running towards the open field. We didn't know where we were going or what was happening, we just heard automatic gunshots all around us. Two people, Yehuda and Galit, had a big car and got us inside it and away. They saved us."Lior also talks about the importance of music to her healing process. "Everyone that was at the Nova festival, we love to dance, we love to be together. After the massacre happened, it was important for the community to get back together and to strengthen each other, to be with each other and talk and feel our emotions."But she says she's been struggling to enjoy something which is a huge part of her identity. "It's been hard for me to listen to music since the Nova festival, and still I only feel comfortable listening to music at concerts with the artists that come to this place," Lia says. Above the seating area, a huge garden stretches up a low hill. It's framed with trees laden with citrus fruits and row after row of bushy herbs, the rosemary and sage scenting the air. The survivors often walk through it and pick the leaves to turn into herbal teas. Nature is a big part of this place. The need for space is so great that new rustic tents are being built to make room for the hundreds of people who are now coming here.Each day, professional clinical psychologists mix with the survivors who arrive. They're there to talk as much or as little as needed. Dr Itamar Cohen is one of them. He flew in from London as soon as he could after 7 October.I ask about the stories he's heard. He breathes deeply, then answers. "People here have seen a tremendous amount of pain. Some of them were extremely close to not being here any more. Some were chased and had to run for their lives. There wasn't much time to process that, just running away from a massacre. And now they still need to function, and they still need to go and push through."There's another element too. "A lot of people are experiencing some sort of grief, they lost tens of their friends at one time. And there's guilt. 'Why am I the one who survived and not my friend? I should have picked up more survivors inside my car to drive them to safety.' So a lot of thoughts around, 'I am not really worthy of being saved and I could have done better.'"Dr Cohen tells me that being around other therapists at a dark time helps them all. "We have time to see together, to process and to speak about the challenges and our vulnerabilities, and our fears and sense of guilt. It means we have a space to work that through and to strengthen each other, and it helps me as well, tremendously." Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.	
07/12/2023 00:49:00	Putin makes rare foreign trip to Gulf states - BBC News	Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a rare trip abroad to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia.Expected discussion topics included the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as oil production, with the UAE president. The UAE is currently hosting the COP28 UN climate summit. Mr Putin, who has barely left Russia since March when the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued him an arrest warrant, will also see Iran's leader on Thursday in Moscow. The ICC has accused him of illegally deporting Ukrainian children to Russia - a war crime - but neither the UAE nor Saudi Arabia recognise the court's jurisdiction. The Russian leader has snubbed other recent international summits including Brics in South Africa in August and the G20 summit in September in India. The trips come as Russia is keen to project influence and undermine the West's attempts to isolate it.Mr Putin was greeted in the UAE with a full cavalry escort and motorcade while a national aerobatics team drew the Russian flag in the sky with smoke trails.  Russia's leader told UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan that "our relations have reached unprecedented levels".Trade and oil will be on the agenda in the UAE, which a Kremlin statement said is "Russia's main economic partner in the Arab world".The Russian president later travelled to Saudi Arabia to meet the kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.During a brief televised sitdown chat Mr Putin invited the crown prince to visit Moscow. "Nothing can prevent the development of our friendly relations," he said, adding that it was important "to exchange information and assessments" on current regional events.The crown prince said bilateral co-operation had "helped remove many tensions in the Middle East".  The controversial leader of Russia's Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, was also spotted attending the meeting between Mr Putin and the de facto ruler of the Gulf state.Ahead of the meeting the Kremlin reported that the two leaders would "consider ways to promote de-escalation" in the conflict between Israel and Hamas and that conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Sudan would be discussed in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Russian news agency Tass also reported that Russian government spokesman,  Dmitry Peskov, had confirmed that Mr Putin and the crown prince had discussed Opec+ cooperation.Kremlin officials have announced that Mr Putin will meet Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi on Thursday to discuss the war in Gaza.Mr Putin has visited only Russian-occupied Ukraine, Iran and China since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.	
06/12/2023 19:28:00	BBC reporter in Gaza: People here are traumatised and exhausted - BBC News	Young men in jeans and flip-flops stand in line in front of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, as if they are watching a funeral procession.It's another night in the tense gloom outside the accident and emergency department. Medical personnel in scrubs are poised to receive more casualties. Voices are raised and men crowd around.Public order is starting to break down - people are traumatised and exhausted.A car pulls up, its horn blaring and lights flashing. A young man is pulled out and put onto a stretcher, then rushed inside. Then another car arrives, covered in dust, and a child who is only four or five is helped out. He is able to walk.Hospitals in Khan Younis - the Gaza Strip's second largest city - have been overwhelmed since the Israeli air force intensified its bombardment of the south on Friday.Israeli tanks and troops have also now entered the city, after the ground offensive was widened following the collapse of a temporary truce with Hamas.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 1,200 people have been killed across the territory since the fighting resumed.That has brought to more than 16,000 the total number killed in Gaza during the war, which was triggered by Hamas's attacks on southern Israel on 7 October. Gunmen from Hamas - a proscribed terrorist organisation in Israel, the UK, US and EU - killed at least 1,200 people and took more than 240 back to Gaza as hostages.Many of Gaza's 2.3 million residents sought refuge in the south after the Israeli military ordered civilians to leave the north in the early days of the war.But with the fighting spreading to Khan Younis, they're running out of places to flee to.Thousands of displaced people are crammed inside the grounds and corridors of the city's European Hospital."When we are playing and there is bombardment, we immediately run to the tents near the walls and [pretend to be] asleep," says one of the children there as the sounds of explosions fill the air."We are afraid. The glass of windows shatters above us."A woman at the hospital says she fled to al-Fakhari, an area east of Khan Younis, after receiving phone calls telling them that it was a "safe zone". But now, she says, the area is being bombarded and the situation is "very bad"."I don't see any area being safe when it comes to us, nor is any area habitable."A 75-year-old man agrees that nowhere is safe."The situation is indescribable. There are children and women. We, as elderly, can withstand what is happening," he says."Listen to the ongoing sounds - how could someone sit and wait for the opportunity to leave a safe zone? Where is the safety? We can't sense it. Every place we go to, they say it is safe but we can't find that."In downtown Khan Younis, Samah Ilwan waves two empty water bottles in the air and says her six children - five girls and one boy - are thirsty."We have become like cats and dogs. Perhaps cats and dogs get shelters. We don't have any. We're stranded in the street."Life is also closing in on me. Despite everything that has happened to me and my family since the start of the war, this is the first time that I feel completely lost.All willpower and control have been ripped from me. I'm used to keeping my family safe and secure, coming up with a plan. Now, I am torn by indecision. I'm originally from the north but I fled south with my family after being ordered to do so by the Israeli army, who said the south was "safe".Currently, I am alone in Khan Younis, while my family is in central Gaza. I was able to travel up to see them every few days. But now, the Israelis have shut one road and the second one is very dangerous.Should I go south to Rafah, keep working and hope that my family will be ok? Or should I try to get back to them, stop reporting, and if it comes to the worst, then at least we die together?I hope no-one else ever has to face this awful choice, which is not a choice at all.	
06/12/2023 16:18:00	Israel hostages in Gaza: We have evidence their health worsening, say families - BBC News	Families of people being held captive in Gaza say they have "solid intelligence" that the health of several hostages has deteriorated.Some are "now in immediate danger", the group of hostages' families said in a letter to Israel's war cabinet.Pressure has been growing on officials over the 138 people still being held by Hamas and other armed groups.Some of the freed hostages met Israel's leaders on Tuesday in a meeting that witnesses say turned rowdy.Israel has repeatedly pledged to do everything it can to rescue the remaining hostages. Some 110 hostages have been released in total - but a week-long truce under which dozens were freed ended last week and since then Israel has resumed its bombing of Gaza. In a letter sent to the war cabinet, the Hostages Families HQ group said: "We have received solid intelligence that there are abductees whose condition has deteriorated and are now in immediate danger." They said at least one-third of the hostages were suffering from underlying illnesses and needed regular medical treatment - and going without such treatment was dangerous.Many abductees were also suffering from injuries from the 7 October attack - such as gunshot wounds or amputations - while some were tortured and abused, the group added."Based on this data, we demand that you act urgently, with initiative and creativity to obtain a deal for the immediate release of all the abductees - for them every additional day in captivity is a real danger to their lives," it said.It is thought the evidence they cite has come from the newly-released hostages, who on Tuesday evening held a meeting with Israel's prime minister and war cabinet and described what they saw during their captivity.Observers say the meeting turned tense and disorganised - with some accusing the government of putting politics before the wellbeing of their loved-ones.According to Israeli newspaper Haaretz, one former hostage - Israeli nurse Nili Margalit - told the meeting she had been looking after some of the elderly people being held captive, and that they suffered from heart disease, kidney failure and Parkinson's."They lie on mattresses all day long. I don't know how they manage since I left," she said.Another former hostage said she was scared by the bombing in Gaza, Haaretz reported."I see [Israeli] bombings there, and you have no idea where the captives are. I was in a house surrounded by explosions. We slept in tunnels, and we feared not Hamas, but Israel might kill us, and then it would have been said, 'Hamas killed you,'" she said. In an audio recording from the meeting, obtained by Israeli news site Ynet, another unnamed former hostage whose husband is still in captivity said she saw an 85-year-old Israeli man killed."I saw Aryeh Zalmanovich die in front of me," she said. "And is that what you have to say, that you want to bring down the Hamas regime? That you want to show them who has bigger balls?"Applause could be heard in the auditorium at the woman's outburst.In the recording, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can be heard telling the families that there was "no possibility right now of bringing everyone home".Haaretz also quoted Mr Netanyahu as saying: "We couldn't bring them all at once. If we could have done it, we would have." He said that the reports of hostages' hearing Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bombings while in captivity "pierces the heart. It not only pierces the heart, but as you'll surely understand, it also affects our operational considerations".And he repeated Israel's pledge to rescue all hostages, saying: "Our responsibility is to bring them all back. We'll fulfil this responsibility and bring them home."IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari repeated the pledge, saying: "As the IDF expands its operations to dismantle Hamas in Gaza, we have not lost sight, not for one moment, of our critical mission to rescue our hostages, to do everything in our power to bring our hostages home."	
06/12/2023 15:53:00	How missiles from Yemen could escalate Israel-Gaza war - BBC News	It is well over 1,000 miles from the coast of Yemen to the Gaza Strip, and yet what happened last Sunday at the southern end of the Red Sea has the potential to dramatically escalate the war between Israel and Hamas.According to US Central Command, the division of the US Department of Defence that covers the Middle East, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen carried out four attacks on three commercial ships operating in international waters. The attacks involved a combination of explosive drones and anti-ship ballistic missiles.The US Navy already had a guided missile destroyer in the vicinity, the USS Carney, which managed to shoot down three of the drones. Others hit their targets, causing some damage but no casualties."These attacks" said the Pentagon, "represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security." In a further statement it added that it believed the attacks from Yemen were "enabled by Iran". The location of the attacks is significant. They took place just north of the strategic chokepoint of the Bab El Mandeb Strait, a 20-mile wide channel that separates Africa from the Arabian Peninsula and through which about 17,000 ships and 10% of global trade pass every year. Any ship passing through the Suez Canal and heading on south to the Indian Ocean has to pass this strait, close to the coast of Yemen.So what was behind these attacks and what exactly is the link to Gaza?Most of the populated parts of Yemen, including its Red Sea coast, have been under the control of a tribal militia known as the Houthis which overthrew the legitimate, elected Yemeni government in late 2014. They are backed by Iran which has allegedly been supplying them with weapons and training, including drone and missile technology, just as it has with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.The Houthi coup triggered a catastrophic civil war that has dragged on for more than nine years, causing thousands of casualties and triggering a humanitarian disaster. While Iran backs the Houthis, Saudi Arabia and the UAE went to war against them in 2015, backed by the US and UK, in an unsuccessful bid to restore the internationally recognised government.During this war the Houthis have fired numerous long-range missiles and drones at targets in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and inside Yemen, hitting civil airports, towns and petrochemical infrastructure as well as military targets.Following the outbreak of the latest Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza on 7 October, the Houthis declared their support for what they called "their brothers in Gaza" and have fired missiles and drones towards Eilat and other targets in Israel. These were intercepted by the US Navy's USS Carney which shot them down. But the Houthis have also targeted any shipping which they suspect of having Israeli connections. In November they landed troops by helicopter on the deck of a cargo ship, the Galaxy Leader, and seized it. They have vowed to prevent any Israeli vessels from passing their coast and in a statement on Sunday their military spokesman said the vessels they fired missiles at were attacked because they were "Israeli". Israel's military denied any connection between its government and the ships but media reports say there are some private commercial links with wealthy Israeli businessmen.The US has said subsequently it is "considering all appropriate responses in full coordination with its allies and partners". In practice, Washington will be reluctant to raise tensions any further in a region already nervous about spill-over from the war in Gaza. But if the Houthis in Yemen continue to fire missiles beyond their borders, then eventually the US may decide it needs to retaliate by targeting those missile launch sites. If that happens then there follows the risk that Iran, which supports the Houthis, could also retaliate, potentially leading to the nightmare scenario of a direct conflict between Iran and the US. For now, this is something both sides wish to avoid.	
06/12/2023 12:59:00	UAE extradites British trader Sanjay Shah to Denmark - BBC News	British trader Sanjay Shah has landed in Denmark after being extradited from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over tax fraud charges worth £1.46bn.Mr Shah, who lives in Dubai, is accused of participating in fraudulent share trading schemes. He was arrested by Dubai police last year following the Danish investigation into Solo Capital, a hedge fund that he founded.Mr Shah denies the charges and insists that the trades were legal.Denmark is one of the countries hardest hit by so-called "cum-ex" schemes, although they also flourished in Germany and Belgium. The scam involved rapidly selling shares between investors in order to create confusion over who owned the shares at the time a dividend was paid out. Tax on the dividends was subsequently reclaimed by multiple parties, although it was only paid once. Denmark says Mr Shah's Solo Capital ran fraudulent schemes for companies and investors between 2012 and 2015. Mr Shah is the primary suspect in the Danish case of tax fraud. The money Danish authorities are seeking to recoup amounts to some 12.7bn crowns (£1.46bn; $1.84bn; €1.7bn) - nearly 0.5% of the country's entire GDP."This is one of our biggest and most serious cases of financial fraud," Justice Minister Petter Hummelgaard said.Prosecutors will ask for Mr Shah to be held in custody until the start of his trial, scheduled for January next year. After Mr Shah lost his job as a trader during the 2008 financial crisis, he founded Solo Capital and moved to the UAE. In Dubai, he led an extravagant lifestyle, including living on the exclusive Palm Jumeirah island. Musicians who played for an autism charity he founded included Elton John and Drake.He bought two yachts, naming them the Solo and Solo II. But since 2020, he has been doggedly pursued by Danish authorities over the fraud charges. Much of Mr Shah's fortune, including a £15m central London property, has been frozen.Last month, in a separate case, Mr Shah lost a bid in the UK Supreme Court to block Denmark from pursuing him in English courts. Also in November, British national Guenther Klar, who worked for Solo Capital between 2010 and 2012, went on trial in Denmark in the country's first court case over cum-ex fraud. Mr Klar, who was extradited from Belgium, is accused of defrauding the government of some 320m Danish crowns (£37m). He denies wrongdoing.	
06/12/2023 12:46:00	Images show tours on board Houthi hijacked ship - BBC News	Groups of men have been photographed taking selfies and tours on a cargo ship seized by Yemen's Houthi rebels last month. The Iran-backed group hijacked the Galaxy Leader in the Red Sea in November, saying it was Israeli. Houthi militia members had earlier threatened to target Israeli ships over its war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.Israel denied the claim, while Japan's government said it was operated by Nippon Yusen.Images taken by Reuters and EPA news agencies appear to show people exploring the large vessel.Nippon Yusen, also known as NYK Line, has said the ship was carrying 25 crew members when it was seized near Hodeida in Yemen on its way to India.Those on board are believed to include Bulgarian, Mexican, Filipino and Ukrainian nationals.Japan's government said in November that its ministries and agencies were working with the relevant countries for the early release of the vessel and its crew.Galaxy Leader is owned by Galaxy Maritime Ltd, which is registered in the Isle of Man. It is owned by Ray Car Carriers, which is co-owned by Israeli businessman Abraham Ungar, according to documents from the Isle of Man government's companies registry.Images from on board have shown large groups of people entering and leaving the ship by motor boat, as well as several Yemenis armed with rifles walking the deck.At least one part of the ship also displayed graffiti with a slogan expressing support for Hamas in the Gaza Strip. 	
06/12/2023 06:00:00	Israeli settler violence brings destruction and fear to West Bank as war rages - BBC News	A few nights ago, the school in Khirbet Zanuta, a small Palestinian village in the hills south of Hebron, was destroyed along with most of the houses, by a bulldozer. Its tracks lay fresh and undisturbed in the sand when we arrived. The village was empty as its population of about 200 Palestinians left around a month ago, after sustained pressure and threats from armed and aggressive Jewish settlers who live in nearby outposts that are illegal under both Israeli and international law. A twisted metal sign lies in the rubble of the school in Khirbet Zanuta. In bold black letters it reads "Humanitarian Support to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank". The sign records the donors who gave money to the project. The European Union was the lead donor and, among a panel of European development agencies, is also the coat of arms of the British royal family over the words British Consulate-General Jerusalem. Nadav Weiman came with the BBC to the village. He is a former Israeli special forces soldier who is now an activist with Breaking the Silence, a group of former combatants who campaign against Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. Nadav believes that Jewish settlers, the most militant of whom are known by name to local Palestinians, were once again flouting the law with the police and army. "They're demolishing Palestinian villages, beating up Palestinian farmers, stealing their olives, trying to open a third front, an eastern front against the Palestinians in the West Bank. Why? Because they want the land without Palestinians."Two Israeli soldiers came to investigate what we were doing. One of them told an Israeli member of the BBC team that he was a traitor for visiting Palestinians. They filmed us but took much less interest in what had happened in Khirbet Zanuta, a few miles down the road. When I asked the police if they were investigating the flattening of the school and the village, they emailed back that they were waiting for a complaint. In fact, lawyers for Zanuta's Palestinians had petitioned Israel's Supreme Court. In three days of travelling through the occupied West Bank, Palestinians have said consistently that since the war in Gaza started on 7 October, Jewish settlers are better armed and much more aggressive. Violent attacks, including fatal shootings of Palestinians by armed Jewish settlers in the West Bank have risen sharply. So many attacks are happening that Israel's closest allies, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have condemned violence by extremist settlers and demanded that those guilty of crimes should be prosecuted. In practice, settlers rarely end up in court and if they do, they can usually expect light sentences. The settlers are armed and supported by powerful allies in the Israeli government, led by Itamar Ben Gvir, the minister for national security and Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister who also has security responsibilities in the West Bank. Controversially, Mr Smotrich just found more than $100 million for the settlers. Apparently referring to opinion polls saying Palestinians were supporting Hamas, he told The Times of Israel newspaper that "there are two million Nazis in Judea and Samaria, who hate us exactly as do the Nazis of Hamas-ISIS in Gaza". Judea and Samaria is a biblical term for the West Bank.The reality of settler attacks was captured in a video taken by Muntassar Mhilat, a young Palestinian man from a family of Bedouins who live in the Judean desert not far from Jericho. Their family home was invaded by about 20 violent, armed Jewish men. Muntassar filmed them yelling and pointing weapons. "He was shooting at my uncle, so I ran down there and confronted him. We were pushing each other and screaming, head-to-head. And I was filming him. Then, around 20 settlers came."The video shows a settler loading his M-16 assault rifle and pointing it at the family. One of the women there, Umm Omar, carrying a month old baby, thought they were about to die. "They attacked our house, stole our sheep, threatened my kids with guns and threatened me. Then they hit me and my husband's sister. I thought they were going to slaughter us."No-one was killed. The settlers accused them, falsely the family said, of stealing their goats. The man who pointed a loaded weapon was wearing a police jacket. A common complaint is that settlers have been drafted into the security forces as reservists since 7 October and are abusing the power and position that come with the uniform and automatic weapons issued by the state.The family recognised some of the attackers, as they came from an illegal outpost about a mile away. They know there will be a next time and feel sick with worry. The harassment of Palestinians is also economic and psychological. South of Hebron Palestinian farmers are ploughing with the donkey because local Jewish settlers have threatened to steal or break their tractor if they use it.  Almost at the other end of the West Bank, in a village outside Nablus called Burin, Ahmed Tirawi, a farmer looked across the valley at his olive trees, starting to rot because he has been forbidden by the local settlers to pick them. "If I go up there on the hillside to harvest my olives, it's taking my life in my hands. The settlers make attacks on the farmers here - one bullet and they will kill me."The olive season is always a time of tension, but this time he said it has been "horrible". "My feelings are more than anger. I feel humiliated by all of this. I am powerless to protect myself from just one settler. It's such a humiliation to be so alone and unable to protect yourself. The only solution is international law, two states and to protect people from the Israeli occupation."I went to talk to Yehuda Simon, a prominent settler leader at his own outpost, Havat Gilad, near Nablus. He is a lawyer who has represented settlers accused of attacking Palestinians, and he nodded approvingly when I said Palestinian farmers in the area near where he lived were being stopped from harvesting their olives. "The army came to the conclusion that the Palestinians coming to harvest olives are gathering information in order to carry out an attack like on 7 October."He dismissed the repeated, documented reports of settlers attacking Palestinians. "I don't hear about people who kill Palestinians. Okay. If the Palestinian just sits on his balcony and the settlers come and kill him, it's never happened. Okay. And I don't believe that the British and United States and all countries in the world, they are a friend of Israel… even Joe Biden is against Jewish people. He doesn't like Jewish people."As for the Arabs: "They could stay here with us, but not try to kill us in the beginning."For more than a century, Arabs and Jews have been fighting over this small piece of land. The war in Gaza hasn't just increased violence in the West Bank. The way it ends, when it ends, will affect whether the next generation can escape this endless conflict. The sight of families forced out of their homes raises memories of 1948 for Palestinians. By the time Israel won the battle for its independence, more than 700,000 Palestinians had either fled or been expelled from their homes at gunpoint. The new state took their property and never allowed them to go home. Palestinians call the events of 1948 the "Nakba" or catastrophe. Settler violence and the loss of homes confirm, for Palestinians, their worst fears, that powerful forces in Israel's government and the settler movement want them out and are using the huge crisis surrounding the war in Gaza to make it happen.	
07/12/2023 00:00:00	No room in shelters as thousands flee to Gaza border city - BBC News		
06/12/2023 01:58:00	COP28: Is the world about to promise to ditch fossil fuels? - BBC News	The UN climate change conference in Dubai is close to a big breakthrough on reducing the gases heating our planet, its United Arab Emirates hosts believe.Expressing "cautious optimism", the UAE negotiating team believes COP28 is gearing up to commit to phasing down fossil fuels over coming decades.Maybe even ditching them altogether. Hosting a climate conference in a petrostate sounds like the beginning of a bad joke, but there are signs that it could deliver real progress on climate.Surely working out how to get rid of fossil fuels is what this UN climate conference is all about, you are probably thinking.But bizarre as it may sound, until just a couple of years ago fossil fuels were effectively "f-words" at these huge global gatherings - rarely ever uttered. The first formal debate about their future was at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021 and the only commitment made there was a promise to "phase down" the dirtiest one of the lot, coal.Let's be clear, a pledge now will not mean the world will stop using fossil fuels completely.We are very unlikely to get any commitment on an expiry date, that would be far too controversial.And "abated" fossil fuels will still be allowed. That is when the atmosphere-heating carbon dioxide they emit is captured to stop it causing climate change.But at least the world will have acknowledged what has always been implied by these negotiations - that we need to deal with the main source of climate change.That would be an historic first and an important step forward.So why might it happen here in the oil-rich UAE of all places?A phase-out is in the text under discussion here in Dubai and is what the man in charge of these negotiations - Sultan al-Jaber, the president of COP28 and the head of UAE state oil company Adnoc - says he wants. Much to his annoyance this desire has not been widely reported.That is at least in part because Mr Jaber has been saying it in the kind of bureaucratic language only the most committed COP-heads understand.He says he is the first COP president to encourage "parties to come forward with language on all the fossil fuels for the negotiated text".He explains he is "engaging with all the parties" and wants them to come forward with "common grounds and consensus".  Confused?  Here's my own crack at a translation:"I've spoken to representatives of all the world's countries and urged them to agree in COP28's final text to phasing out the use of fossil fuels, or at least phasing them down."Mr Jaber has repeatedly promised this summit will "take a new road", do "unprecedented" things and be "transformational".  Many readers may be surprised that the UAE, a country built on a foundation of oil money, might be trying to get the world to agree to stop using the stuff.And you may have seen stories in recent days about Mr Jaber even questioning the science of global warming during COP28.He insisted on Monday that his comments had been misinterpreted, adding: "I have said over and over again that the phase-down and the phase-out of fossil fuel is inevitable." Mr Jaber was joined at a press conference by the UN authority on climate science, Prof Jim Skea, who is head of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Prof Skea explained that meeting the target of limiting global warming to 1.5C would mean getting rid of unabated coal completely by 2050. Oil will need to be cut by 60%, natural gas by 45%, he said.So, even in 2050 the world will still need a lot of the stuff the UAE is so rich in. But - once again - only if it can be "abated", if the emissions can be captured to stop them causing climate change and the technology to do that does not exist at anywhere near the scale needed. When Mr Jaber says the science has guided everything his team has done - which he has repeatedly done - this is the science he is talking about. In short, the UAE has recognised the world has to kick its addiction to unabated fossil fuels and has decided to put itself decisively on the right side of history by trying to own the decision.But yes, at the same time it is planning to increase capacity and sell even more oil.OK, so the boss of the talks wants it to happen, but what makes him think he can get a deal?More than 100 countries, including the US and the EU, have already said they want to see a phase-out of fossil fuels.China has traditionally been a hold-out on the issue but a couple of weeks back there was a hint that its position might have changed.For the first time it talked about targets for emissions reduction from electricity generation when US President Biden met President Xi of China at a summit in California. And remember, China is far and away the world leader both in the production and installation of renewable technologies.Russia has traditionally also been reluctant to support action on climate but the UAE team are very confident it can "be persuaded".That suggests some sort of deal has probably been done and experts on Russian climate policy say that is very possible.  They say Russia takes a very "transactional" approach to these UN pledges, not least because Russian President Vladimir Putin - who's visiting the UAE and Saudi Arabia today - would not feel obliged to stick to any commitment anyway.But, Mr Jaber still hasn't quite got it over the line.His biggest problem is with his neighbour, Saudi Arabia - the world's second biggest producer of oil and gas (after the US).The Saudi Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, was asked whether his country would support a promise to phase down fossil fuels in a TV interview in the Saudi capital Riyadh earlier this week. "Absolutely not," he replied.But I have it from a reliable authority that the Saudi state oil behemoth, Aramco, supports just such a move.Why? Because it would enhance the reputation of the country and make it easier for it to do business.And one last thought for you.  Saudi Arabia's leader, Mohammed bin Salman, has a very public modernisation agenda.  His model is the UAE, with its gleaming global business hub, Dubai.It's not in the bag yet, but keep an eye on Dubai.	
05/12/2023 23:12:00	US sanctions individuals implicated in West Bank attacks - BBC News	The US has announced a visa ban on extremists responsible for violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was taking action to target attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians. But the top diplomat said the ban would also apply to Palestinians accused of violence. Attacks have surged in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's assault on southern Israel on 7 October.US state department spokesman Matthew Miller said the ban would affect "dozens" of extremist Israelis and some of their family members. He said that laws forbid the US from naming those targeted.The move marks the latest expression of frustration from Washington at the Israeli government's position towards settlers. Senior far-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich - both settlers themselves - have previously been accused of seeking to downplay violence in the West Bank. And in recent weeks Palestinians in the West Bank have told BBC News that Israeli settlers are using the war in Gaza as an opportunity to seize land.More than 700,000 Jewish people live in more than 250 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel and the US dispute this interpretation.The UN says it has recorded 314 settler attacks against Palestinians since 7 October, resulting in Palestinian casualties or damage to Palestinian-owned property. Four Israelis, including three security forces personnel, have been killed in attacks by Palestinians in the West Bank over the same period. "We have underscored to the Israeli government the need to do more to hold accountable extremist settlers who have committed violent attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank," Mr Blinken said in a statement on Tuesday. "As President Biden has repeatedly said, those attacks are unacceptable."The decision comes just over a month after Israel was accepted into the US Visa Waiver Program, which allows Israeli citizens visa-free travel to the US. Individuals targeted by Tuesday's announcement will not be eligible for the programme, according to the Associated Press news agency, and current US visa holders will have their travel passes revoked. American passport holders are not affected by the new policy.Reacting to the US decision, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told reporters: "There is, sadly, violence from extremists that we must condemn.""In a state of law, and Israel is a state of law, the right to use violence belongs only to those who are certified to do so by the government," he said, according to Reuters.	
05/12/2023 22:16:00	Nimisha Priya: The Indian nurse from Kerala on death row in Yemen - BBC News	Nimisha Priya, barely 19, left the southern Indian state of Kerala for Yemen in 2008 with big dreams. She had found work as a nurse in a government-run hospital in the capital Sanaa and told her mother, a poorly-paid domestic helper, that their days of hardships would be over soon.Fifteen years later, that dream has turned into a nightmare for Nimisha and her family. The 34-year-old is on death row for murdering a local man, Talal Abdo Madhi. She's counting out her days in Sanaa central jail in the capital of the war-torn country.On 13 November, Yemen's Supreme Judicial Council rejected her appeal, clearing the decks for her execution. But as Yemen follows Sharia law, the court gave her one last option of escaping death - she can secure a pardon from the victim's family by paying diyah or "blood money". Now, her family and campaigners are racing against time, hoping to pull a miracle and get that pardon that would allow her to live. Prema Kumari, Nimisha's 57-year-old mother, breaks down repeatedly as she describes her daughter's ordeal."I will go to Yemen and seek their forgiveness. I will apologise to them, I'll tell them, take my life but please spare my daughter," says Prema Kumari who lives in the southern Indian city of Kochi. "Nimisha has a young daughter who needs her mother."But travelling to Yemen is not easy. A 2017 Indian government ban on citizens travelling to Yemen remains and those needing to travel need special permission. A lobby group called Save Nimisha Priya International Action Council has filed a petition in the Delhi high court, seeking permission for Nimisha's mother and her 11-year-old daughter Mishal to travel to Sana'a. It said two council members would accompany them. But last Friday, Indian authorities rejected the request, saying they didn't have a diplomatic presence in Yemen to ensure their safety.The government's assessment is based on the political situation in Yemen. Sanaa is controlled by Houthi rebels who have been locked in a prolonged civil war with Yemen's government, which is based the southern city of Aden. India does not recognise the Houthis so a trip to Yemen for Indian citizens is bound to be fraught with dangers - they will have to fly to Aden and then travel for 12-14 hours to Sanaa by road. The Save Nimisha council has once again approached the Delhi high court, renewing its request to  allow her mother and daughter to travel to Yemen. And with each passing day, Prema Kumari's desperation is growing. "I don't want my daughter to die in a foreign land," she says."What happened to Nimisha is very unfortunate, she doesn't deserve it," says Babu John, social activist and member of the Save Nimisha council. He adds that Nimisha was looking at a bright future but got stranded in Yemen when the civil war broke out. Nimisha, her mother says, was good at studies and the local church supported her school education and paid for her nursing diploma course. But she was ineligible for a nursing job in Kerala because she hadn't cleared her school leaving exams before doing the diploma.The job in Yemen was meant to be her ticket out of crippling poverty.In 2011, she returned home to marry Tomy Thomas in a match arranged by her family. The couple returned to Yemen, where he found work as an electrician's assistant, but the pay was paltry. After December 2012, when their daughter was born, they struggled to make a living and in 2014, Mr Thomas returned along with the child to Kochi where he now drives a tuk-tuk.Nimisha decided to quit her low-paying job and start her own clinic in 2014. But the law in Yemen mandated her to have a local as a partner and that's where Mahdi came into the picture. His ran a textile store nearby and his wife had given birth in the clinic where Nimisha worked. In January 2015, when Nimisha came home for her daughter's baptism, Mahdi came along for a holiday. Nimisha and her husband borrowed money from friends and family, together raising 5m rupees ($60,000; £47,000), and a month later, Nimisha returned to Yemen to start her clinic. She also started the paperwork so her husband and daughter could join her in Yemen, but in March, a civil war broke out there and they couldn't travel.Over the next two months, India evacuated 4,600 citizens and nearly 1,000 foreign nationals from Yemen. Nimisha was among a few hundreds who did not leave. "We had invested so much money in the clinic and she couldn't just get up and leave," Mr Thomas says. On his phone, he shows me photographs of the 14-bed clinic - the signboard of the Al Aman Medical Clinic, spanking new blue chairs in the reception area, a man in a white coat posing next to brand new lab equipment, a new Sony TV mounted on a wall in the waiting room, and Mahdi sitting in the pharmacy.The clinic, Mr Thomas says, soon started doing well, but Nimisha also started to complain about Mahdi.According to the petition in the Delhi high court - which the BBC has seen - Mahdi "stole a photograph of Nimisha's wedding when he visited their home in Kochi and he later manipulated it to claim he was married to Nimisha".It says that "he physically tortured her and took away all the revenue collection from the clinic" and that their "relationship deteriorated when Nimisha questioned him about embezzlement of funds". On several occasions, "he threatened her with a gun" and "seized her passport to prevent her from leaving". And when she complained to the police, "instead of taking any action against him, they locked her up for six days", it adds. Mr Thomas first learnt about the murder in 2017 through TV news channels. "The headline was - Malayali [Kerala] nurse Nimisha Priya arrested for murdering husband, chopping up his body in Yemen," he says. Nimisha was arrested from close to Yemen's border with Saudi Arabia - more than a month after Mahdi's chopped up body was found in a water tank."How could this man be her husband when she was married to me?" he asks while showing me their wedding album.Mr Thomas says when she called him from prison a few days after her arrest, they both cried. "She said she had done all this for me and our child. She could have taken the easy way and lived with Mahdi, but she didn't want to do that. My love and affection for her has grown after this ordeal."KR Subhash Chandran, a migrant rights activist and Supreme Court lawyer who is representing Nimisha's mother and the council in the Delhi high court, says "Nimisha did not really intend to kill Mahdi" and that "she too is a victim"."Mahdi had confiscated her passport and she was trying to get it back from him. So, she tried to sedate him, but she overdosed him and he died," he says.The exploitation of semi-skilled and unskilled Indian workers in Gulf countries is well documented. Activists say many countries in the region practice Kafala - which means the employer keeps a worker's passport and documents. International Labour Organization says it's slavery by another name and opens migrant workers to all sorts of abuse. Most victims of Kafala, Mr Chandran says, are Indian women who go to the Middle East to work as domestic workers, trying to escape poverty at home.He is now also calling for "a retrial so Nimisha has a chance to defend herself". "She did not receive a proper legal trial. The court appointed a junior lawyer to represent her but she couldn't communicate with him because she doesn't know any Arabic. She wasn't given an interpreter and she had no idea what documents she was signing," he says.Yemeni authorities have not commented on the case in Delhi.Deepa Joseph, lawyer and social activist and vice-chair of the Save Nimisha council, says the Indian government's support is key to saving Nimisha. "The only option is to seek forgiveness from Mahdi's family and negotiate blood money with them."A well-known business tycoon from Kerala has already pledged 10m rupees ($112,000 ;£95,000) to the cause. And the council is confident that Kerala residents at home and in the diaspora would contribute to make up any shortfall."I have full hope that Nimisha can be saved. I think the victim's family will accept the blood money," Ms Joseph says. "She may have committed a serious crime but I want to save her for her mother and her daughter." Prema Kumari is now hoping to travel to Yemen and speak to Mahdi's family.When Mr Thomas spoke to his wife just days before Yemen's Supreme Council rejected her appeal, Nimisha sounded hopeful. "Keep your strength and pray for me," she'd told him. But when he spoke to her after the court decision, she sounded "depressed"."I tried to console her by saying that efforts were being made to save her life, but she didn't sound convinced. How can I remain hopeful? she asked me," he said.	
05/12/2023 21:09:00	Birmingham-based aid worker warns of worsening conditions in Gaza - BBC News	A British aid worker who recently returned from the Middle East warned the situation for refugees in Gaza was likely to get worse over the winter.Syed Muhammad Faisal Sami, head of the Birmingham-based Faizen Global Relief Foundation, called for more essential supplies to be sent.He said: "They don't have any shelters, they don't have any food, they are running out of water and now the winter is starting as well."Many of Gaza's 2.3 million residents are sheltering in the south after being previously ordered to leave the north by Israel.Israel's military has been expanding its ground offensive against Hamas.It said it would operate with "maximum force" in the south, as it had done in the north - where there has been widespread destruction over the past eight weeks.Mr Sami was in the region for three days and said aid agencies were trying their best to help those who had been forced to leave their homes.He estimated his charity's containers, sent from Turkey, had fed about 41,000 people in Gaza so far.Israel launched a full-scale campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says almost 15,900 people have been killed in the territory since the war began, while the UN says a humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding.Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

05/12/2023 19:49:00	Israel's new Gaza evacuation zones leave Palestinians few places to go - BBC News	Aid agencies are warning that Palestinian civilians are running out of places to flee to, after the Israeli military first ordered tens of thousands to evacuate part of the main city in the south ahead of an assault by tanks and troops.A map posted on social media on Monday told people in northern and central Khan Younis to leave immediately to "preserve your safety and security". Arrows directed them to move to three already overcrowded areas to the south and west.On Tuesday however, the Israeli military said its forces had already entered the city and it was now too dangerous to leave."Don't get out. Going out is dangerous. You have been warned," new leaflets said, warning people to stay inside designated shelters and hospitals.The evacuation of specific areas marked on online maps is part of a new approach the military says it is taking to avoid civilian casualties in its eight-week war with Hamas, following heavy pressure from the United States. But there is concern that the strategy is too complicated, too dependent on technology, and too likely to cause panic to be a workable solution.BBC Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is currently in Istanbul, said he had spoken to relatives and other people in the affected areas who were not aware of the IDF's map or could not see it because of patchy internet access and no regular supply of electricity."This is a joke, not a map, because we don't know where to go," a displaced person who was sheltering in Khan Younis told him.There is also no guarantee they will be safe from bombardment if they flee.The main Palestinian telecommunications firm meanwhile said that all phone and internet services were cut once again.Before a temporary truce collapsed last Friday, the Israeli ground operation was focused on the north of Gaza.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued a blanket order to all 1.1 million people living there to move south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.   Hundreds of thousands heeded the call as Israeli troops penetrated deep into Gaza City - with many of them eventually ending up in Khan Younis.The IDF also repeatedly urged civilians across Gaza to move to al-Mawasi, a thin strip of territory along the Mediterranean coast which officials described as a "humanitarian zone".During a visit to Israel on Thursday while the fighting was paused, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had told Israeli leaders that they had to "put in place humanitarian civilian protection plans that minimize further casualties of innocent Palestinians". These included "clearly and precisely designating areas and places in southern and central Gaza where they can be safe and out of the line of fire", he added. The IDF's response was to publish on its Arabic-language website on Friday an "Evacuation Zone Map" that divided Gaza into more than 600 numbered blocks, ranging in size from about 0.03 to 25 sq km (0.001 to 9.6 sq miles).  Jets also dropped leaflets with QR codes, allowing people with a working smartphone and an internet connection to access the map - and also asking them to share their location.Asked about this approach on Monday, US state department spokesman Matthew Miller said it had "seen improvements". "We have seen them evacuate specific neighbourhoods, rather than entire areas, so the number of displaced persons will hopefully be lower in southern Gaza than it was in the north," he added.However the IDF's order for civilians to move from Khan Younis to Rafah was condemned by the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, which runs the biggest humanitarian operation in Gaza and has 958,000 displaced people sheltering at 99 facilities in the south."The order created panic, fear and anxiety," warned Philippe Lazzarini on Monday evening. "At least an additional 60,000 people were forced to move to already overcrowded Unrwa shelters, with more asking to be sheltered.""The evacuation order pushes people to concentrate into what is less than one-third of the Gaza Strip," he added.Mr Lazzarini also stressed that "no place is safe in Gaza, whether in the south, or the south-west, whether in Rafah or in any unilaterally called 'safe zone'".Unicef spokesman James Elder, who was recently in Gaza, told the BBC on Tuesday that the idea of a "safe zone" was a "dangerous false narrative".He said that under international law Israel had to ensure places of evacuation had conditions for people to survive. In an apparent reference to al-Mawasi, he added: "These are tiny patches of barren land. They have no water, no facilities, no shelter from the cold, no sanitation."A senior adviser to Israel's prime minister rejected such criticism in a BBC interview on Monday."I don't believe that nowhere is safe," Mark Regev said. "We've designated safer zones for people to go to. If you believe the Hamas propaganda, we're just hitting innocent buildings, right? But if we're hitting a structure, it's because there's Hamas either in or under the structure."Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 70% of the almost 15,900 people killed there since the start of the conflict have been women and children.Israel launched a military campaign in response to a cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people - including many women and children - were killed and about 240 others taken hostage. 	
05/12/2023 17:15:00	Israel Gaza: Hamas raped and mutilated women on 7 October, BBC hears - BBC News	The BBC has seen and heard evidence of rape, sexual violence and mutilation of women during the 7 October Hamas attacks.WARNING: CONTAINS EXTREMELY GRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND RAPESeveral people involved in collecting and identifying the bodies of those killed in the attack told us they had seen multiple signs of sexual assault, including broken pelvises, bruises, cuts and tears, and that the victims ranged from children and teenagers to pensioners.Video testimony of an eyewitness at the Nova music festival, shown to journalists by Israeli police, detailed the gang rape, mutilation and execution of one victim.Videos of naked and bloodied women filmed by Hamas on the day of the attack, and photographs of bodies taken at the sites afterwards, suggest that women were sexually targeted by their attackers.Few victims are thought to have survived to tell their own stories.  Their last moments are being pieced together from survivors, body-collectors, morgue staff and footage from the attack sites.Police have privately shown journalists a single horrific testimony that they filmed of a woman who was at the Nova festival site during the attack.She describes seeing Hamas fighters gang rape a woman and mutilate her, before the last of her attackers shot her in the head as he continued to rape her.In the video, the woman known as Witness S mimes the attackers picking up and passing the victim from one to another."She was alive," the witness says. "She was bleeding from her back." She goes on to detail how the men cut off parts of the victim's body during the assault."They sliced her breast and threw it on the street," she says. "They were playing with it."The victim was passed to another man in uniform, she continues."He penetrated her, and shot her in the head before he finished. He didn't even pick up his pants; he shoots and ejaculates."One man we spoke to from the festival site said he heard the "noises and screams of people being murdered, raped, decapitated".To our question about how he could be sure - without seeing it - that the screams he heard indicated sexual assault rather than other kinds of violence, he said he believed while listening at the time that it could only have been rape. A statement he made through a support organisation describes it as "inhuman". "Some women were raped before they were dead, some raped while injured, and some were already dead when the terrorists raped their lifeless bodies," his statement says. "I desperately wanted to help, but there was nothing I could do."Police say they have "multiple" eye-witness accounts of sexual assault, but wouldn't give any more clarification on how many.  When we spoke to them, they hadn't yet interviewed any surviving victims.Hamas has rejected Israel's accusation that its men sexually assaulted women during the attacks.Israel's Women's Empowerment Minister, May Golan, told the BBC that a few victims of rape or sexual assault had survived the attacks, and that they were all currently receiving psychiatric treatment."But very, very few. The majority were brutally murdered," she said. "They aren't able to talk - not with me, and not to anyone from the government [or] from the media."Videos filmed by Hamas include footage of one woman, handcuffed and taken hostage with cuts to her arms and a large patch of blood staining the seat of her trousers.In others, women carried away by the fighters appear to be naked or semi-clothed.Multiple photographs from the sites after the attack show the bodies of women naked from the waist down, or with their underwear ripped to one side, legs splayed, with signs of trauma to their genitals and legs.  "It really feels like Hamas learned how to weaponise women's bodies from ISIS [the Islamic State group] in Iraq, from cases in Bosnia," said Dr Cochav Elkayam-Levy, a legal expert at the Davis Institute of International Relations at Hebrew University."It brings me chills just to know the details that they knew about what to do to women: cut their organs, mutilate their genitals, rape. It's horrifying to know this.""I spoke with at least three girls who are now hospitalised for a very hard psychiatric situation because of the rapes they watched," Minister May Golan told me. "They pretended to be dead and they watched it, and heard everything.  And they can't deal with it."Israel's police chief Yaacov Shabtai said that many survivors of the attacks were finding it difficult to talk and that he thought some of them would never testify about what they saw or experienced. "Eighteen young men and women have been hospitalised in mental health hospitals because they could no longer function," he said.Others are reportedly suicidal. One of those working with the teams around survivors told the BBC that some had already killed themselves.Much of the evidence has come from the volunteer body-collectors deployed after the attacks, and those who handled the bodies once they arrived at the Shura army base for identification.One of the body-collectors volunteering with the religious organisation Zaka described to me signs of torture and mutilation which included, he said, a pregnant woman whose womb had been ripped open before she was killed, and her foetus stabbed while it was inside her.The BBC has not been able to independently verify this account, and Israeli media reports have questioned some testimony from volunteers working in the traumatic aftermath of the Hamas attacks.Another, Nachman Dyksztejna, provided written testimony of seeing the bodies of two women in kibbutz Be'eri with their hands and legs tied to a bed. "One was sexually terrorised with a knife stuck in her vagina and all her internal organs removed," his statement says.   At the festival site, he says small shelters were "filled with piles of women. Their clothing was torn on the upper part, but their bottoms were completely naked. Piles and piles of women. […] When you took a closer look at their heads, you saw a single shot straight to the brain of each."Hundreds of bodies were collected from the attack sites by volunteers.  Investigators admit that in those first chaotic days after the attacks, with some areas still active combat zones, opportunities to carefully document the crime scenes, or take forensic evidence, were limited or missed."For the first five days, we still had terrorists on the ground in Israel," May Golan said. "And there were hundreds, hundreds of bodies everywhere. They were burned, they were without organs, they were butchered completely.""This was a mass casualty event," police spokesman Dean Elsdunne told journalists at a briefing.  "The first thing was to work on identifying the victims, not necessarily on crime scene investigation. People were waiting to hear what happened to their loved ones."It was staff at the army's Shura base, where bodies arrived for identification, who have provided investigators with some of the most crucial evidence.This evidence emerged from a makeshift hub of tents and refrigerated shipping containers set up at the base to identify the bodies.When we visited, hospital trolleys, their iron skeletons topped with khaki stretchers, stood neatly lined up in front of the containers that housed the dead; the white plastic overalls of those on shift translucent under the floodlights.Fighter jets roared overhead, drowning out the cicadas, as Israel's bombardment of Gaza continued.Teams here told us they'd seen clear evidence of rape and sexual violence on the bodies coming in, including broken pelvises from sustained violent abuse."We see women of all ages," one of the reservists on the forensic team, Captain Maayan, told the BBC. "We see rape victims. We see women who have been through violation. We have pathologists and we see the bruises, we learn about the cuts and tears, and we know they have been sexually abused."I ask her what proportion of the bodies she's handled show signs of this."Abundant," she said. "Abundant amount of women and girls of all ages."The number of victims is hard to define, partly because of the state of the bodies."It's definitely multiple," said another serving soldier who asked us to use only her first name, Avigayil. "It's hard to tell. I've dealt with more than a few burned bodies and I have no idea what they went through beforehand. And bodies that are missing the bottom half - I also don't know if they were raped. But women that were clearly raped? There are enough. More than enough." "Sometimes we are left only with a very small part of the body," Dr Elkayam-Levy tells me. "Maybe it's a finger, a foot or a hand that they're trying to identify. People were burned to ashes. Nothing was left. […] I want to say that we'll never know how many cases there were."Privately some of those working on this talk in terms of "dozens" of victims but quickly caution that evidence is still being gathered and pieced together.The civil commission headed by Dr Elkayam-Levy, to collect testimony on sexual crimes, is calling for international recognition that what happened on 7 October was systematic abuse, constituting Crimes Against Humanity."We see definite patterns," she told me. "So it wasn't incidental, it wasn't random. They came with a clear order. It was […] rape as genocide."Avigayil agrees there were similarities in the violence visited on the bodies that arrived at the Shura base."There are patterns in that groups of women from the same place were treated in a similar manner," she said.  "There might be a set of women who were raped in one way, and we're seeing similarities in the bodies; and then a different set that were not raped but shot multiple times in the exact same pattern. So it seems that different groups of terrorists had different forms of cruelty.""This was a premeditative, systematic event," police chief Yaacov Shabtai told journalists.David Katz from Israel's cyber crime unit which is involved in the investigation, told journalists that it was too early to prove that sexual violence was planned as part of the attack, but that data extracted from the phones of the Hamas attackers suggested that "everything was systematic"."It would be reckless to say we can already prove it […] but everything that was done there was done systematically," he said. "Nothing happened by coincidence. Rape was systematic."Israel's government points to documents it says were found on Hamas fighters that appear to support the idea that sexual violence was planned. It's released clips of interrogations with some captured fighters in which they appear to say that women were targeted for this purpose.Last week, UN Women put out a statement saying it "unequivocally condemn[ed] the brutal attacks by Hamas" and was "alarmed by the numerous accounts of gender-based atrocities and sexual violence during those attacks".Dr Elkayam-Levy said before the statement that international women's rights organisations had taken far too long to respond to her call for support."This is the most documented atrocity humanity has known," she told me."Israel on 7 October is not the same country that woke up the following morning," said police chief Yaacov Shabtai.Amid the horror of what happened to women here, Captain Maayan from the Shura identification unit says the hardest moments are when she sees "the mascara on their eyelashes, or the earrings they put on that morning".I ask where that lands in her, as a woman."Terror," she replied. "It terrorises us."Additional reporting by Scarlett Barter	
04/12/2023 23:14:00	Israel orders evacuations from city in south Gaza as offensive widens - BBC News	Israel's military has ordered the evacuation of a fifth of the main city in southern Gaza, as it expands its ground offensive against Hamas.A map showed six northern and central areas of Khan Younis where an estimated 167,000 people needed to leave. Witnesses also reported seeing tanks to the east, and a doctor said a local hospital was overwhelmed by casualties.In Gaza City, an unconfirmed report says 50 people were killed when Israeli air strikes hit two schools.According to the Palestinian news agency Wafa, they died in schools sheltering displaced people in the city's Daraj neighbourhood. Reuters news agency has said that the strikes are still to be independently verified and that the Hamas-run health ministry could not be reached for comment. The Israeli army said it was looking into the report. Many of Gaza's 2.3 million residents are sheltering in the south after being previously ordered to leave the north.The Israeli military said it would operate with "maximum force" in the south, as it had done in the north - where there has been widespread destruction over the past eight weeks.Israel launched a full-scale campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says almost 15,900 people have been killed in the territory since the war began, while the UN says a humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding.A temporary ceasefire that lasted for seven days, which led to the release of 105 of the hostages and 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails, fell apart on Friday.BBC Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is currently in Istanbul, says about 200 Israeli air strikes were reported overnight.About 15 to 20 locations were targeted in and around Khan Younis, where the local population has swelled to as much as 1.2 million, according to local authorities. The central town of Deir al-Balah, about 8km (5 miles) to the north, was also bombed heavily.Dozens of casualties, including women and children, arrived at Khan Younis's Nasser Hospital from different areas. Many were dead or seriously injured.Mohammed Eid wiped tears from his bandaged face as he lined up among the mourners by bodies covered in white shrouds outside the hospital on Monday morning."We were sleeping safely, minding our own business. Suddenly, a bomb fell on us, and the whole building was destroyed," he told the BBC."My brother was torn into pieces, and so was his wife. My daughter was killed, and his daughters were killed, including his littlest. We can't find my mum, and my niece."Later, witnesses and local journalists in Gaza reported that they had seen Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles on the eastern outskirts of Khan Younis, by Abasan and Khuzaa, which is nearest to the boundary fence with Israel.  Moaz Mohammed told AFP news agency that he had seen tanks moving down the main north-south highway, Salah al-Din Road, which has been one of two Israeli-designated evacuation routes. The tanks were "firing bullets and tank shells at cars and people trying to move through the area" between Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, he said.At the same time, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned civilians to avoid a section of Salah al-Din Road in the same area, saying it now constituted a "battlefield" and was "extremely dangerous".The IDF also posted a map that ordered residents of six northern and central neighbourhoods of Khan Younis - al-Mahatta, al-Katiba, Hamad, al-Satir, Bani Suheila and Ma'in - to leave immediately to "preserve your safety and security". According to the UN, the marked area in Khan Younis was home to almost 117,000 people before the war. It also includes 21 shelters where 50,000 displaced people are currently living.The map tells them to move to al-Fukhari, east of Khan Younis, and Rafah's al-Shaboura and Tal al-Sultan neighbourhoods, which are already overcrowded. IDF chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement that Israeli forces were continuing to operate with "maximum force against Hamas terrorists and infrastructure, while minimising harm to the civilians that Hamas places around them as shields"."We are dropping leaflets with QR codes that opens a map guiding Gazans to safer areas. The map is divided into neighbourhood numbers indicating where civilians in a specific area should go to avoid being in the crossfire," he added.The IDF has introduced the scheme because it is under heavy pressure from the US to protect civilians. However, our Gaza correspondent says he has spoken to Palestinians in the affected areas who are not aware of the map or cannot see it because there is no internet coverage."This is a joke, not a map, because we don't know where to go," a displaced person who was sheltering in Khan Younis told him.Meanwhile, an orthopaedic surgeon at the European Hospital in Khan Younis told the BBC that it was overwhelmed by hundreds of wounded."It is chaotic - we can't absorb any more patients and they keep coming," Dr Paul Ley said. "We have more than 360 people on the operating list, which is impossible to deal with." Dr Ley also said the hospital's corridors and grounds were full with 6,000 to 7,000 displaced people, some of whom were medics who had fled the north."Anaesthetics and pain killers are a big problem - we are running out slowly so we are lowering our safety standards. We never leave the hospital and our presence here has been notified to the Israelis, but shrapnel has reached the hospital," he added.Médecins Sans Frontières also warned that more than 100 dead and over 400 injured people had arrived at the emergency room of Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah in the last 48 hours, and that there was no space for new patients.The UN said on Monday that four hospitals in the north were partially operating and admitting patients, with only limited services. The 12 hospitals in the south are partially functional, but bed capacity is only half what it was before the war and only one hospital can perform complex surgery.	
04/12/2023 22:42:00	Teenage British-Israeli soldier Binyamin Needham killed in Gaza - BBC News	A British-Israeli teenager has been killed in Gaza while serving in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).Binyamin Needham, 19, reportedly moved from England to Israel with his family when he was eight-years-old.He is at least the second UK citizen to have died while serving in the Israeli military during the current conflict.Mr Needham's sister told Israeli media her brother was "always smiling, always loving" and had only recently completed his training.Speaking to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, sister Orly said:  "He was so proud, and he had just finished basic training. He was happy to defend the country."She told Israeli public broadcaster Kan News Mr Needham was "happy to be in the army and to be protecting the Jewish people and our homeland", adding: "We are so, so proud of him."Mr Needham's death was confirmed by the IDF in a statement, which said he had been posthumously promoted to the rank of sergeant. He was one of three fatalities confirmed by the Israeli military on Monday, taking its death toll to 75 since the current conflict between Israel and Gaza broke out.An IDF statement said Mr Needham was serving with the Combat Engineering Corps and "fell in battle in the northern Gaza Strip".Nathanel Young, 20, was the first British solider serving with the IDF to be killed. He died on 7 October near the border with Gaza, his family said.The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has been contacted for comment.	
04/12/2023 22:11:00	COP28: Should India and China benefit from a climate damage fund? - BBC News	China is the top emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, while India comes in at number three.The two countries also have major economies - so why is there a disagreement over whether they should contribute to a fund to tackle the damage caused by climate change?The question remains even after COP28 - this year's United Nations (UN) climate change conference in Dubai - announced a deal between countries to begin the operation of the fund and 18 countries pledged money for it.A report released in 2022 by the Vulnerable 20 Group (V20), which has 68 developing nations as its members, showed that 55 members (the rest joined recently) had lost $525bn (£414.2bn) because of climate change over the last two decades. This was one-fifth of their wealth.China and India are not among these countries but argue that they too have vulnerable communities which will need financial support from such a fund.A 2022 UN report said that by 2030, developing countries would need over $300bn annually to fight climate change. "Loss and damage finance needs are closely connected to our ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change," it added. The fund aims to provide financial assistance to poorer nations that have been hit by climate-related disasters - for example, communities displaced by floods or rising sea levels - so that they can rebuild and be rehabilitated.It is different from climate adaptation funds because loss and damage refer to a situation in which communities can no longer adapt to climatic impacts or prepare for it because the damage has already been done.After years of disagreement between developed and developing countries, the loss and damage fund was established in principle during last year's COP27 in Egypt.The agreement is to begin its operation at COP28. Fifteen developed countries and a developing nation (COP28 host UAE) have made funding pledges totalling to around $660m so far, according to the Natural Resources Defence Council that has been tracking financial pledges at COP28.The US - a developed country and the second largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world - and other developed nations say China and India should join them in not only making significant cuts in emissions for meaningful global climate action, but also contribute to the fund.But China and India disagree, arguing their high levels of emissions are a recent development when compared to the historic emissions of developed countries like the US and the UK.They also claim they are still developing countries, as set out in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change signed in 1992, and therefore actually qualify to receive the loss and damage fund they are being asked to contribute to.In the year since COP27, counties have had heated debates about how to make the fund work, and finally in October 2023 agreed on a set of recommendations.The recommendations, now approved by COP28, "urge" developed countries to support the loss and damage fund, and "encourage" others to support it voluntarily.The decision also makes it clear that all developing countries are eligible to apply for funding.But negotiators say the decision has not ended tensions between developed countries and major developing economies like China and India over whether the latter should pay for the fund or they should receive it."The sources of finance remain a major contentious issue that has been parked for now," said a negotiator, from a country in the West, who asked not to be named.China overtook the US as the largest carbon dioxide (CO2) emitter in 2006.But both China and India argue the climate crisis was caused by developed countries emitting greenhouse gases from as early as the 1850s, when the industrial period began.The two Asian giants also point to the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which basically means all countries have responsibility to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but their share of responsibility depends on their development needs.Many civil societies and climate campaigners have also supported that same argument."The massive losses and damages we are seeing right now are the result of 30 years of largely foot-dragging by developed countries on reducing their emissions faster and providing climate finance to developing countries," says Liane Schalatek, associate director at Heinrich Boll Stiftung, a US-based international organisation that closely follows loss and damage negotiations."To ask developing countries to contribute to the new fund on an equal footing with developed countries is morally wrong and disingenuous," she argued.Developed countries, however, argue the grouping of countries is outdated and needs revising.Countries were labelled as developed and developing back in 1992. Critics say a lot has changed since then, particularly with countries like China and India which are now both major economies and among the top greenhouse gas emitters.And now with the UAE, a developing country in the UNFCCC listing, having pledged $100m for the fund, they say an example has been set."We hope not just China and India but also other countries like Saudi Arabia - developing countries according to the 1992 list - will see themselves more as contributors to the fund than recipients," an anonymous negotiator from a Western country added.Some small island states also echoed that message.Michai Robertson, lead loss and damage finance negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, argues there's a "moral responsibility to engage with the fund" that needs to be met by major economies such as China and India."Having the words 'encourage other parties to provide fund' in the recommendation is an acknowledgement by the entire committee (including developed and developing countries) that we need beyond developed countries as well and other parties to be involved too."But it is not the first time a climate fund has taken a long time to be established.A policy and advocacy officer I spoke to likens the debate over the loss and damage climate fund to a previous climate finance pledge that still hasn't materialised."It is unsurprising that many developing countries view this as little more than a delaying tactic, given the decade-long trust deficit which lies at the heart of UN climate negotiations," says Ross Fitzpatrick of Christian Aid, a poverty relief organisation."The trust deficit is best exemplified by the failure of wealthy nations to deliver on their previous pledge to provide $100bn in annual climate finance beginning in 2020."This $100bn climate finance pledge is separate from the loss and damage climate fund, and was made by developed countries during the climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009.As long as that pledge remains unfulfilled, major developing countries will always have an argument for not making any contribution to the loss and damage climate fund, says Aarti Khosla, the director of Climate Trends, a Delhi-based organisation that researches loss and damage negotiations and other climate issues."The principles of the convention (the 1992 UN climate convention) make a case for evolving responsibilities, meaning the definition of the 'common but differentiated responsibilities' also changes," she says."But it is not simple for China and India to pay in the fund without the developed world having lived up to its previous promise."BBC News India is now on YouTube.

04/12/2023 20:39:00	Rushdi Abualouf: 'It's so much harder to watch Gaza from the outside' - BBC News	The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf, who has reported from Gaza for decades, left the territory with his family on 20 November for the sake of their safety. It was six weeks after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel that has led to weeks of Israeli bombardment within Gaza. He is now in Istanbul, Turkey. Speaking on the BBC's Newshour programme, he described how it felt to leave his home and observe Gaza from the outside.My family and I grew up in Gaza, we were born in Gaza.I really feel sad that I have had to leave in this way. I have a memory from every corner of my house, and from every corner of my neighbourhood. The rest of my wife's family - her father, mother and brother - are still there, while my father, brothers and sisters also remain in Gaza.To be honest, it's more difficult for me to watch Gaza from the outside, because when I was there, inside the enclave, I was busy dealing with too many things and not thinking about the situation in the Strip. Now, when you are out, you have more time to think. And it's very hard for me to imagine that I will no longer see my house or sleep in my bed, and I will no longer see my neighbours and my neighbourhood.Since we left for Istanbul, we were told that our home was destroyed. I mean the whole building, the whole neighbourhood was destroyed. Some of my BBC Arabic colleagues are still there. I met them all one night before I left because I wasn't sure about the timing, and there was a surprise call in the night telling me to leave. I told them I would do everything I could to get them out. "Be strong and work together, the BBC is very proud of you, the BBC will do everything possible to protect you and try to get you out," I told them.I've called them every morning since I left Gaza. I'm always with them, always advising them, helping them solve every problem they are facing in their location or with their family, and hopefully they will be out soon.My family had a chance to leave right at the beginning.When Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October, my first call was to the BBC to tell them what happened.The second was to my wife.I said to her: "Please prepare your bag, you have to leave Gaza now." I was expecting a very big retaliation from Israel, and the Rafah crossing was still open for the first couple of days after the Hamas raids.At the beginning, my wife did not realise how big the situation would be and how dangerous it was. I would have to stay to work, and because she didn't want us to be apart, she refused and said: "We will stay together, live together."On the third day we lost this chance - the Rafah crossing was bombed and closed.And then you have to deal with so many things. You have to deal with your old father who lives far away from you. You have to learn to deal with your family and you have to deal with your job. You have to report, and all the time in the back of your mind is your father, in the back of your mind is your wife, your kids, your place - whenever they drop a bomb, you think: is it close to your house?  After we were forced to leave Gaza City, we first arrived in Khan Younis and stayed with family for a couple of days. Then there was a warning that the house would be bombed. So we had to leave and found ourselves with nowhere to go.I decided to put up a tent near a workspace I'd set up in Nasr hospital in Khan Younis. My family stayed there for about a week. I found a house near the hospital so that they could be close to me, so if something happened I could rush to them. My flat in Gaza City was 170 sq m, but now everyone was squeezed into one small room. They were worried about me not being with them all the time, and also there was not enough food.My wife was injured that day when she tried to come and see me. The kids were crying that they wanted to see their dad and they decided to go from the house to the hospital. When they arrived, one of the buildings was hit - that day they almost died.Now that we are out, I know that I will definitely go back.I always say as a journalist that Gaza is the perfect place to be - because you will find a story on every corner. But for me personally, my family has been suffering for a very long time. I told my wife when we left Gaza, when we walked out of the gate: "I will not let you go back under any circumstances. "So you have to start establishing your life somewhere else." Now my kids are happy to be out, to go back to a normal life, though they still miss everything.But I am a journalist, and as soon as the situation allows me to go back to Gaza I will, because I'm connected to this story and I think those 2.3 million people in the Strip deserve having somebody to tell their story.

Hamas has denied the group carried out sexual violence during the 7 October attacks. Pictures and live footage streamed by the militants pointed to the gruesome nature of the attacks at the Supernova festival.A range of violence from gang rape to the sexual mutilation of murdered victims are being investigated by police."I saw a number of first-hand, eyewitness accounts, for example of one survivor who hid in the bushes and saw a woman next to her being raped by several men," Prof Halperin-Kaddari told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.She said she also spoke to a paramedic who treated a woman who lost a life-threatening amount of blood after reporting being raped by four men."I saw footage and pictures from numerous locations of bodies whose condition were all exhibiting the same pattern of mutilation and leaving no doubt that rape was performed on these women before they were executed," she said.Prof Halperin-Kaddari added that the the concentration of cases, all in one day but in several locations left her in "no doubt" that there was a "premeditation to use sexual violence as a weapon of war."Hamas said it "rejected and strongly denounced" the reports of abuses. In a post on the messaging app Telegram, it said that such claims were "lies" by Israel that sought to distort the "humane" way Hamas has treated Israeli hostages. Hamas took some 240 people hostage on 7 October - 110 were released last week as part of a truce with Israel.Israeli women's rights and legal activists had been calling on key international organisations to publicly acknowledge reports of gender-based violence, including sexual violence, in the wake of Hamas's attacks.On Monday, dozens of demonstrators gathered outside the UN headquarters in New York, protesting over what they said was its inaction over the rape, abduction and mistreatment of Israeli women.Prof Halperin-Kaddari, who spent 12 years as a member of a UN convention on discrimination against women, said she and others have been calling on UN bodies to acknowledge these "crimes against humanity"."Regrettably, until a week ago, none of them said the explicit word 'sexual violence'. It took them more than seven weeks," she said. The UN has yet to respond to accusations of a delay, but Prof Halperin-Kaddari visited the UN in Geneva just a week ago to draw attention to the violence.UN Women issued a statement - eight weeks after the attacks - acknowledging accounts of gender-based atrocities."This took them too long, much too long," Prof Halperin-Kaddari added.Yael Sherer from the Lobby to Combat Sexual Violence advocacy group told Today that men were also victims of sexual violence on 7 October.She said evidence is being gathered from some survivors of the attacks, as well as eyewitnesses and first responders, who have been detailing the violence."Hamas terrorists made sure to disgrace these people and dishonour them in many ways," she said. This included violence carried out on the victims' bodies after they had died, Ms Sherer added. "We also saw people who were bleeding... [and] people who were tied down to furniture with zip-ties, and were not clothed, of many ages."An ongoing UN commission of inquiry investigating alleged war crimes on both sides of the Israel-Hamas conflict will include a focus on sexual violence carried out during the attacks on 7 October. However, Israel has not so far co-operated with the commission, viewing it as biased. Navi Pillay, who chairs the inquiry, said if Tel Aviv did not want to co-operate, her team could still take evidence from survivors and witnesses outside the country."All they [Israel] have to do is let us in," she told the BBC, adding that survivors of the attacks should be able to get a UN hearing.Ms Pillay also rejected claims that the UN delayed acknowledging that sexual violence had taken place during Hamas's attacks and said "every effort" was being made as part of her team's investigations.The Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October killed 1,200 people.Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 15,500 people have been killed in Israel's military campaign which it launched in response.	
04/12/2023 02:14:00	US warship shoots down drones fired from Houthi-held Yemen in Red Sea - BBC News	A US warship shot down three drones after three commercial vessels came under attack in the Red Sea, the US military has said.It said the USS Carney assisted the ships - which had links to 14 nations including the UK - on Sunday after they were targeted from areas of Yemen held by Iran-backed Houthi rebels.Two of the ships were hit by missiles but there were no casualties, it added. A Houthi spokesman said the group's navy had attacked two Israeli ships.The Israeli military said the vessels had no connection to Israel.The Iranian-backed Houthis have controlled parts of Yemen since the movement toppled the country's government in 2014, sparking an ongoing civil war.It has recently begun targeting Israel-linked vessels in the Red Sea over Israel's war with Iranian-backed Hamas in Gaza.US Central Command (Centcom), part of the US military which oversees operations in the Middle East, said that on Sunday morning, the USS Carney detected an anti-ship ballistic missile exploding near the Unity Explorer, a Bahamian-flagged, UK-owned and operated cargo ship.It later shot down a drone that was heading towards the Carney itself, although Centcom said it was not clear whether the drone was targeting the Carney. That afternoon, the Unity Explorer suffered minor damage after being struck by a missile fired from Houthi-controlled area. While responding to a distress call from the ship, the US vessel detected and shot down another incoming drone. Later, two more ships - one of them part UK-owned, both of them flagged in Panama - reported being struck by missiles. While on its way to assist the second ship, the USS Carney shot down a third drone. Centcom said the attacks had "jeopardised the lives" of the ships' multinational crews and represented a "direct threat to international commerce and maritime security"."We also have every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran," it said. "The United States will consider all appropriate responses in full coordination with its international allies and partners."Earlier this week, the US said its warship captured armed men who had earlier seized an Israeli-linked tanker off Yemen's coast.Centcom reported that two missiles were then fired towards the warship from rebel Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen.The Houthis have declared themselves part of an "axis of resistance" of Iran-affiliated groups, which works in opposition to Israel, the US, and the wider West. 	
03/12/2023 20:45:00	Israeli forces pushing into south Gaza - BBC News	Israeli ground forces are pushing into southern Gaza, after three days of heavy bombardment. Initial reports from Israeli army radio effectively confirmed Israel has launched a ground operation to the north of Khan Younis.The BBC has also verified images of an Israeli tank operating near the city. The head of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) later told troops the IDF was also fighting "strongly and thoroughly" in south Gaza.Lt General Herzi Halevi was speaking to reservists from the Gaza division about military objectives and the IDF's killing of Hamas commanders.He told the soldiers: "We fought strongly and thoroughly in the northern Gaza Strip, and we are also doing it now in the southern Gaza Strip". An IDF spokesman later confirmed Israel "continues to expand the ground incursion" across all of Gaza, including troops "conducting face to face battles with terrorists".Since a week-long ceasefire ended on Friday, Israel has resumed a large-scale bombing campaign on Gaza, which residents of Khan Younis have described as the heaviest wave of attacks so far. The seven-day truce saw Hamas release 110 hostages being held in Gaza in return for 240 Palestinians being released from Israeli prisons.On Sunday morning, the Israeli army issued evacuation orders for several districts of Khan Younis, urging people to leave immediately.Israeli authorities believe members of the Hamas leadership are hiding in the city, where hundreds of thousands of people have been sheltering after fleeing fighting in the north in the early stages of the war.A UN official has described a "degree of panic" he has not seen before in a Gaza hospital, after the Israeli military shifted the focus of its offensive to the south.James Elder, from the children's agency Unicef, described Nasser Medical Hospital in Khan Younis as a "warzone".An adviser to Israel's prime minister said Israel is making "maximum effort" to avoid killing civilians.Mr Elder told the BBC he could hear constant large explosions close to the Nasser hospital and children were arriving with head injuries, terrible burns, and shrapnel from recent blasts."It's a hospital I've gone to regularly and the children know me now, the families know me now. Those same people are grabbing my hand, or grabbing my shirt saying 'please take us somewhere safe. Where is safe?'""They are unfortunately asking a question to which the only answer is there is nowhere safe. And that includes for them, as they know, that hospital," he said.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 500 people have been killed since the bombing resumed. More than 15,500 people have been killed in the strip since the war began, the ministry also said. Mohammed Ghalayini, a British-Palestinian who has stayed in Gaza, said the situation in the city was "beyond catastrophic"."People have been, for 50 days or more, withstanding brutal Israeli onslaught and are very low on all resources - food, water, power and the sanitation and the waste services," he told the BBC by phone, before the connection cut off.The air pollution expert, who normally lives in Manchester, arrived in Gaza for a three-month visit to see his mother shortly before the 7 October attacks.Israel began its retaliatory bombing of Gaza following Hamas's attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, which saw around 1,200 people killed and 240 taken hostage.Rockets have also been regularly fired at Israel from Gaza since fighting resumed on Friday. A 22-year-old man in the city of Holon, near Tel Aviv, was treated for minor shrapnel injuries on Saturday. Hundreds of thousands of people have already fled the fighting to take shelter in Khan Younis, after Israel told them to leave the north of the strip.The latest UN update says around 1.8 million people are internally displaced in Gaza.Speaking to the BBC, the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees chief, Filippo Grandi, said Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are being "pushed more and more towards a narrow corner of what is already a very narrow territory". The IDF has begun posting maps of areas set to be attacked online. It says these maps, along with other measures like phone calls and leaflets being dropped on Gaza by plane, will warn people to evacuate.Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser Mark Regev said civilians are not targets and protecting them is made more difficult by Hamas "embedding its military terror machine" in civilian neighbourhoods.He says the IDF are trying to be "as surgical as we can in a very difficult combat situation", and has given advance warning of attacks.Separately, the IDF say they have destroyed 500 "terror tunnel" shafts used by Hamas in Gaza, out of the 800 they say have been found so far.It also said around 10,000 air strikes on "terror targets" have been carried out by the air force "under the guidance of IDF soldiers on the ground" since the war began. 	
05/12/2023 00:00:00	Israel says troops in 'heart of Khan Younis' after bombarding south Gaza - BBC News		
02/12/2023 20:42:00	Israel-Gaza war: Residents of Khan Younis say Israeli strikes heaviest since start of war - BBC News	Israel has carried out intense air strikes on Khan Younis in southern Gaza, with residents describing it as the heaviest bombing of the war.People in eastern areas of the city have been told by the Israeli military to evacuate further to the south. Israel believes some Hamas leaders are in the city, where many civilians are sheltering after fleeing the north.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 193 people have been killed in the latest wave of Israeli attacks.On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) resumed its offensive against Hamas in Gaza, launched in response to the 7 October attacks in Israel which killed around 1,200 people.The Hamas-run health ministry says the number of people killed in Gaza has now exceeded 15,200 people.Israel's bombardment of Gaza resumed after a temporary ceasefire ended on Friday. The IDF said it had hit more than 400 Hamas "terror targets" on the first day of the renewed operation. Rockets have also been regularly fired at Israel from Gaza since fighting resumed, including a barrage aimed at Tel Aviv and the surrounding area of central Israel on Saturday evening.Following this attack, Israel's ambulance service said it treated a 22-year-old man for "minor shrapnel injuries" to the head in Holon - a city just south of Tel Aviv.At a briefing on Saturday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to continue with the Israeli military operation until "we achieve all the goals" in eliminating Hamas and securing the release of the hostages.He acknowledged that "a tough war is ahead of us". Khan Younis and the city of Rafah, on the border with Egypt, were some of the places hit with heavy air strikes, with the next phase of the offensive likely to focus on southern Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have sought shelter in the area, after being told to flee the north of the territory, which was Israel's main target in the early stages of the war.The IDF's Arabic-language spokesman posted maps on social media indicating which areas civilians should leave, directing people in areas east of Khan Younis to evacuate further south to shelters in Rafah, an indication that a ground offensive could be imminent.Hospitals, operating with limited resources after weeks of fighting, were overwhelmed with casualties, and at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, some patients were treated on the floor."A night of horror," Samira, a mother of four, told the Reuters news agency. "It was one of the worst nights we spent in Khan Younis in the past six weeks since we arrived here... We are so afraid they will enter Khan Younis."Unicef spokesman James Elder, who was in Khan Younis on Saturday, told the BBC that hospitals were already "saturated" with casualties before the strikes resumed. "There is literally blood in the corridors, there are mothers yet again holding babies who look like they've been killed", he said.The Palestinian Red Crescent charity confirmed 100 lorries with aid were allowed to enter Gaza from Egypt on Saturday. On Friday, no humanitarian supplies were delivered to the territory. Talks to reach a deal for another temporary ceasefire and to secure the release of the people kidnapped on 7 October who remain in Gaza collapsed on Saturday. A Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that the negotiations were completely stalled, with no contacts or attempts to reach a fresh truce.On Saturday, Israel announced it was pulling its negotiators from the Mossad intelligence service out of talks in Qatar, which has been acting as a mediator, following an "impasse in the negotiations".Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas's political bureau, told Al Jazeera on Saturday that "there are no negotiations now" and there would be no more prisoners exchanged with Israel until the war is over.US Vice President Kamala Harris, in a meeting with the president of Egypt, said "under no circumstances [would] the United States permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, the besiegement of Gaza, or the redrawing of the borders of Gaza".She also reiterated the US position that Israel had the right to defend itself.During their meeting in Dubai on the sidelines of the UN's COP28 climate conference, she told Abdul Fattah al-Sisi that peace efforts could only succeed if "pursued in the context of a clear political horizon for the Palestinian people towards a state of their own led by a revitalized Palestinian Authority".At Saturday's briefing, Mr Netanyahu praised the release of 110 Israeli hostages - women and children - as well as some foreigners."Welcome back from hell," Mr Netanyahu said.The hostages were released in exchange for the freeing of 240 Palestinian prisoners - women and teenagers. Most of the about 140 captives remaining in Gaza are men and military personnel.	
02/12/2023 16:44:00	COP28: UN climate talks go big on ending fossil fuels - BBC News	Countries and oil companies at the UN climate talks have promised to make major progress in tackling global warming in a large new energy pledge. Around 100 countries promised to treble world renewable energy use by 2030.And 50 oil and gas companies including Saudi giant Aramco pledged to stop adding to planet-warming gases by 2050.That only covers emissions from production, not the burning of fossil fuels and critics said it would not meaningfully tackle climate change.But countries pledging to triple renewable energy at the COP28 summit in Dubai said it would help remove fossil fuels from the world's energy system by 2050 at the latest. Supporters, including the EU and COP28 host country the United Arab Emirates (UAE), want the pledge to be included in the final deal made at COP, meaning all of the nearly 200 countries represented here would sign up.Climate groups cautiously welcomed the promise to ramp up renewables, but said that promises by oil and gas companies were "greenwashing"."I am very sceptical," said Prof Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics and author of numerous UN climate change reports."The real challenge for the oil and gas sector is to move away from producing oil and gas," he said. "Nothing else really matters in the end."Fatih Birol from the International Energy Agency told BBC News that the fossil fuel industry should reduce its emissions from production by 2030, 20 years earlier than the date promised. They account for around 15% of global emissions - and that's before you even count the gases given off when their products are used to power vehicles and heat homes.He said it is "facing a moment of truth now in Dubai... Is it going to be partnering with the rest of the world.. Or is it going to stick to their business plans?".Addressing the summit on Saturday, COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber said the new pledge "adds up to more countries and more companies from more sectors than ever before, all aligning with our North Star of 1.5C".World leaders agreed in Paris in 2015 to limit global warming to that amount. Burning huge amounts of oil, gas and coal is driving climate change but leaders cannot yet agree on how fast the world should stop using them.Mr Jaber called Saturday's pledge "a great first step"."Whilst many national oil companies have adopted net zero 2050 targets for the first time, I know that they and others, can and need to do more," he said. "We need the entire industry to keep 1.5C within reach and set even stronger ambitions for decarbonisation."The UAE says the Decarbonisation Charter will speed up climate action as oil and gas companies that account for 40% of the world's emissions promise to become net zero by 2050.Reaching net zero means stopping adding greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.Carroll Muffett, president of the Center for International Environmental Law, however, said that the only way to 'decarbonize' carbon-based oil and gas is to stop producing it "quickly, completely, and permanently"."Anything short of this is just more industry greenwash."The 50 companies, which also include the UAE's state oil company, also pledge to almost entirely stop releasing the potently planet-heating gas methane during oil and gas production by 2030.On Saturday UN Secretary-General General António Guterres told the talks that the world must "phase out fossil fuels" in time to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. "The rapid acceleration of clean energy is needed, and we've called for the tripling of renewables. But it is only half the solution," said Tina Stige, Climate Envoy for the Marshall Islands, which is one of the nation's most vulnerable to climate change."The pledge can't greenwash countries that are simultaneously expanding fossil fuel production," she adds.  The UAE's presidency of the COP28 talks has attracted criticism because the country is one the top 10 oil and gas producers in the world and the summit's president Sultan al-Jaber also heads the giant Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc).More world leaders are addressing COP28 which is in its third day. In a speech read on behalf of Pope Francis - who cannot attend due to illness - he said renewable energy was crucial to saving the world as well as "the elimination of fossil fuels, and education in lifestyles that are less dependant."	
02/12/2023 00:59:00	Bowen: US sets clearer red lines for Israel as ceasefire ends - BBC News	In the end it was a diplomatic achievement that the ceasefire lasted as long as it did. Now, after a seven-day pause, Israel and Hamas are facing their greatest military and political challenges. For Hamas, it is the fight to survive. As long as a Hamas gunman can pull a trigger or launch a rocket into Israel it will claim to be undefeated. For all its overwhelming military power, Israel's task is more complicated. Its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swore "mighty vengeance" after Hamas breached the border and killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, on 7 October. In the first hours after the Israeli military went back on the offensive, the government recommitted itself to its war aims in a WhatsApp post: "Releasing the hostages, eliminating Hamas and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to the residents of Israel."How it does that and what happens next are now the number one preoccupations of Mr Netanyahu, his political allies and enemies in Israel and Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state who has made four trips to Israel and the region since the war started.Perhaps Mr Blinken knew that his attempt to prolong what he called the "humanitarian pause" would fail. On the evening before the fighting resumed, he repeated America's support for Israel's right to defend itself, and once again condemned Hamas. Mr Blinken repeated his insistence "that Israel act in accordance with international humanitarian law and the laws of war, even when confronting a terrorist group that respects neither".Then Mr Blinken made his starkest public statement yet about how Israel should fight the war. It is worth quoting at length, because it is a checklist of what the US expects from its closest ally.  Mr Blinken said that it meant "taking more effective steps to protect the lives of civilians, including by clearly and precisely designating areas and places in southern and central Gaza where they can be safe and out of the line of fire"."It means avoiding further significant displacement of civilians inside of Gaza.  It means avoiding damage to life-critical infrastructure, like hospitals, like power stations, like water facilities.""And it means giving civilians who've been displaced to southern Gaza the choice to return to the north as soon as conditions permit.  There must be no enduring internal displacement."At the beginning of the war Joe Biden, the US president, came here. While trying to wrap Israel in a warm and powerful embrace he also warned his allies not to be blinded by rage as they sought justice, as America had been after the al-Qaeda attacks of 11 September, 2001. Mr Blinken's remarks suggest Joe Biden believes that Mr Netanyahu, with whom he has had a difficult relationship, did not listen. Israel's war aims require that the next phase of its offensive is aimed at Hamas in southern Gaza. When it invaded northern Gaza, it ordered Palestinian civilians to head to the south for their own safety. While not as lethal as the north, much of which Israel has turned into a wasteland, nowhere in Gaza is safe. A few hours after hostilities resumed, Palestinians in Rafah, in the far south of Gaza on the border with Egypt, were being killed in Israeli air strikes. Israel cannot claim to have eliminated Hamas without destroying its infrastructure in the south, where it believes Yahya Sinwar and the other leaders are lying low in tunnels under the civilian population, along with an unspecified number of fighting men.If Israel is going to use the same tactics as it did in northern Gaza, thousands more civilians will be killed. Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, already calls the plight of the people of Gaza "an epic humanitarian catastrophe". Egypt, and others, fear that extreme military pressure on approaching two million civilians in the south could mean thousands of desperate people forcing their way over the border into the Sinai Desert. A new Palestinian refugee crisis would be another dangerous and desperate moment for the Middle East. Let us assume that Israel has promised the US that Palestinian civilians will be told to move to specific areas where they will be safe. In a high-intensity war of the kind that Israel has been waging, with tanks, air strikes and heavy artillery, it is far easier to see how that plan might go wrong, rather than how it might succeed.If Israel shifts to lighter counter-insurgency tactics, with troops moving without a blanket of heavy protection, it will most likely suffer many more battle casualties than it has so far.Israel's next moves are also a significant moment for Joe Biden, who is facing strident criticism of his support for Israel from the progressive wing of his own Democratic party. Biden's chief diplomat, Antony Blinken, has spoken clearly, in public, about the way the US wants Israel to fight Hamas. If Israel kills anything like as many Palestinian civilians as it did in the north, in defiance of the stated will of Joe Biden, the US president will have to decide whether he can continue to give Israel so much support, not just on the battlefield but also in the United Nations Security Council, where the US has used its veto many times to protect Israel.  Hamas is not beaten. Its remaining hostages give it a powerful lever that it can use to disrupt Israel's military campaign, and to inflict more psychological pressure on the home front. The Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his men will also try to exploit opportunities that open up if and when Israel's generals follow American instructions to use less firepower. This war is in a new phase. So is the whole region. Many Palestinians and Israelis, including those far from the battles in Gaza, seem beaten down by the weight of a dangerous and uncertain future.	
01/12/2023 21:35:00	'I’m not ready to lose hope': The hostages still in Gaza - BBC News	"She doesn't deserve to wait for the next deal, just because she's not somebody's mother or grandmother," writes Or Neko Maymon on Facebook in Hebrew. Or is talking about 27-year-old street artist and art student Inbar Haiman, who is his partner's sister. Inbar was kidnapped by Hamas from the Supernova music festival in Israel on 7 October, and was seen days later in a hostage video circulated on social media, with blood on her face. She is one of 16 women BBC Verify has identified as still being captive in Gaza, following a seven-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. This pause in fighting saw Hamas agree to release 110 hostages (including 78 women and children), in return for 240 Palestinian prisoners being freed from Israeli jails. Israel's focus on securing the release of female hostages has raised and dashed hopes for the families of the women who are still left behind. Since her kidnap, Inbar's friends and family have been campaigning for her release, and using the hashtag #FreePink, a reference to her street artist name. "I'm really not ready for you to take away my hope to see Inbar come back," Or wrote in another post three days ago. In November, Inbar's boyfriend, 24-year-old Noam Alon, camped for 10 days in front of the central military headquarters in Tel Aviv, calling for the Israeli government to do more to secure Inbar's release. Of the 237 people taken hostage by Hamas and five other armed Palestinian groups during the 7 October attacks, BBC News has verified that 115 are left in Gaza. An Israeli government spokesman says 135 people remain captive. There is no official published list of hostages, so the BBC has had to confirm names itself. Among the remaining hostages are at least 16 women and 95 men. This number includes French-Mexican Orión Hernández Radoux, the boyfriend of 22-year-old Shani Louk, who was killed after being kidnapped from the Supernova musical festival. Soon after the festival was attacked, a video began circulating widely on social media showing the body of a young woman being paraded through the streets. Shani's family was able to identify her in the footage from her dreadlocks and distinctive tattoos.At the end of October, Shani's mother Ricarda said she had been told by the Israeli military that a piece of skull bone belonging to her daughter had been found. Shani's body has not yet been recovered.In November, her boyfriend Orión turned 31 in captivity. "Today is Orión's birthday," wrote family friend Gabriel De la Fuente on Facebook in Spanish, "already a month since his kidnapping, may God return you well."Orión is believed to have been snatched at the festival, and the Sun newspaper says it has seen threatening messages written in Arabic sent from his phone. His friends and family join together in prayer each night at 7pm, in a WhatsApp group created to help them support each other. "Only by uniting together in prayer will we provide the spiritual strength and support that your soul needs right now, wherever it may be," writes Gabriel. Families waiting for loved ones to come home have become a great source of support to each other, says Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat has been captive since 7 October."We became like a real large family of families," he told the BBC News channel. "It feels as though, when their relatives are getting released, so are mine."Carmel, a 39-year-old occupational therapist from Tel Aviv, had been visiting parents in Be'eri on 7 October. Her sister in law, Yarden Roman-Gat, was released by Hamas on Wednesday, and reunited with her husband and three-year-old daughter. "I wasn't even sure that she was alive until I saw her," Gil says of Yarden.  When the 36-year-old German-Israeli, her husband and daughter were captured, they managed to break out of the gunmen's car near the Gaza-Israel barrier, Gil explains. The family then began to run away while being shot at. Realising she couldn't run fast enough, Yarden gave her daughter to her husband and surrendered so that the others could make their escape. "We were very, very happy to see her," says Gil. But now the ceasefire is over, Gil grows more and more scared for his cousin Carmel, who has not yet come home. "We were very, very worried by the fact that the truce is ended," Gil says. "I'm personally very worried for her." Many people whose loved ones remain hostages in Gaza have been using social media to campaign for their release, share feelings and support each other in grief. The mother of dual US-Israeli hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin has been posting videos of herself talking about her son on his family's Bring Hersh Home Facebook page. "I wanted to share with you what happened last night when I woke up at 2:13 in the morning," Rachel told the Facebook page's 17,000 followers on Wednesday. "I started to think about how much pain Hersh must be in."According to eye witnesses Rachel spoke with, Hersh lost half of his arm in a grenade explosion before he was kidnapped from the Supernova festival.Eyewitness accounts say the 23-year-old was seen being forced onto a white pick-up truck. The last-known signal from his phone came from just inside Gaza."It is really important that we get him home so that he can start the process of learning how to live his life in a very different way than he ever lived it before," says Rachel in one of her latest videos. "It's just another reason why we are tenaciously and tirelessly fighting for him to come home."Additional reporting by Emma Pengelly.	
01/12/2023 19:07:00	Gaza's fear and anger as ceasefire ends and fighting erupts - BBC News	The resumption of fighting between Israel and Hamas has been met with a mixture of fear and anger in Gaza, with the UN calling it a "nightmare".A temporary ceasefire expired at 07:00 (05:00 GMT) with both warring sides blaming each other.Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 178 people have been killed in Israeli attacks.A UN official said much-needed aid had stopped coming through the Rafah crossing since the ceasefire ended.On Friday morning, the sound of heavy gunfire could be heard in areas of northern Gaza infiltrated by the Israeli military, with clashes breaking out between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters. There seemed to be no let up in the pace of fighting after the ceasefire, with jet fighters and reconnaissance planes deployed. Areas targeted by air strikes included north-western Gaza and Khan Younis in the south - where hundreds of thousands of people fled earlier in the war to escape fighting in the north. Houses in the city were targeted - including one house in close proximity to Nasser hospital, where the BBC Arabic team was based."Around 06:30 the drones started flying," Mohammad Ghalaiyini, a Briton who is currently in Khan Younis with his family, said in a voice message sent to the BBC. "Around 07:30, I think, the bombings started and there's been like non-stop bombing every 10, 15, 20 minutes."Leaflets dropped by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned that areas east of Khan Younis and Salah al-Din were "dangerous" combat zones and urged people in some parts to head to shelters further south in Rafah, close to the Egyptian border.Meanwhile, Hamas and other groups fired rockets at Israel, which deployed its Iron Dome defence system to intercept them.The renewed clashes were "catastrophic for the people of Gaza," James Elder, a spokesman for the UN children's agency, Unicef, told the BBC.Mr Elder said Nasser hospital - which he said was now Gaza's biggest functioning medical facility - was "wildly overflowing with children and people with wounds of war recovering from the last attack".He said many families had been sleeping on mattresses at the hospital for weeks."This hospital cannot possibly cope with a surge in wounds from the battlefield with more children with burns, with those horrendous shrapnel injuries," he said.Other UN aid agencies have described similar conditions at other hospitals. The situation at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City was "like a horror movie" even before the bombing started again, World Health Organization (WHO) senior emergency officer Rob Holden said.His team - who visited the site earlier in the week - reported patients with "the most horrific injuries" lying on floors "running with blood", while the bodies of those who had been killed were lined up in the car park outside.The WHO says only 18 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are "minimally to partially functional". "Gaza's health system has been crippled by the ongoing hostilities," Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative in the Palestinian territories, said. "We are extremely concerned about the resumption of violence."There is also major concern over the wider humanitarian situation in Gaza, which is likely to worsen as fighting resumes.As supplies of cooking gas, food and water are dangerously low, shops are empty and there is not enough aid to distribute to displaced people.Many are sleeping in tents and have told the BBC they are struggling to cope with the cold weather conditions. They are desperately urging for more aid including warm clothing to be delivered. They also say very little water, food and medicine is reaching hospitals.Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN's relief agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said he was beyond mere concern that "no humanitarian aid has been allowed into Gaza today including fuel".Hundreds of trucks carrying aid were able to enter Gaza during the seven-day ceasefire but they were still fewer in number than the roughly 500 trucks that entered Gaza every day before the war.On Friday Mark Regev, senior adviser to the Israeli prime minister, said Hamas could have ensured the pause in fighting was extended if they had freed more hostages."They have close to 20 women [eligible for release] in the framework of the existing agreement, yet they chose not to do so," Mr Regev told the BBC.Asked whether those women were civilians or Israeli soldiers, Mr Regev said some of the women were in their 20s and had finished their military service.For its part, Hamas says it did make several offers regarding further hostage releases - all of which were rejected by Israel.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its military strikes on Friday had hit Hamas command centres, underground sites and groups of Hamas fighters.Officials in Gaza say more than 14,800 people including about 6,000 children have been killed since Israel began its military campaign against Hamas there, with thousands more believed to be dead under rubble.It follows Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October during which it killed about 1,200 people and kidnapped 240 others. 	
01/12/2023 18:39:00	Manchester scientist in Gaza 'terrified' after breakdown of ceasefire - BBC News	A scientist sheltering in a city in Gaza has said he is "terrified" for his family's safety after the breakdown of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.Mohammed Ghalayini, who lives in Manchester, chose to stay in Khan Yunis to be with his mother and sister.Fighting has resumed in Gaza after the seven-day temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas expired.Mr Ghalayini said warning leaflets telling people to leave Khan Yunis were "very ominous and scary".The British-Palestinian dual national was visiting his relatives when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,300 people, and has remained with family through repeated air strikes.He said he was devastated by the end of the ceasefire."Today, immediately around seven, the bombing returned and there was like repeated bombing for three hours, artillery and airstrikes and naval artillery as well," the 44-year-old said.During the pause in fighting, he said he had an "idyllic" time and cycled to a nearby beach, picked olives, visited friends and collected a large water container to help ensure his family's water supply.Mr Ghalayini said he had hoped the ceasefire would lead to greater de-escalation, but was terrified after leaflets dropped over Khan Yunis told residents they must leave to go to Rafah as the city was a "dangerous combat zone".The scientist said he feared Israel was planning to "corral as many Gazans as possible into as smaller area as possible close to the border" and move them permanently into nearby Egypt.About 25 people are currently staying in Mr Ghalayini's aunt's house in Khan Yunis, with more expected to join them.He said: "People are just being pushed further and further, bit by bit, by this relentless Israeli military campaign."The Israeli Defence Force said its only purpose in dropping leaflets telling people to head for Rafah was to minimise civilian casualties.Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

01/12/2023 16:15:00	Blinken steps up call for Israel to spare civilians in strongest remarks yet - BBC News	US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has clearly laid out benchmarks for the protection of civilians in Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. In the strongest and most specific US remarks yet, Mr Blinken said he'd told the Israeli government that it must avoid further mass displacement of Palestinians and damage to critical infrastructure, like hospitals, power stations and water facilities. He did not, however, appear to set down red lines that would trigger US actions. The secretary of state travelled to Israel to deliver the message - his fourth visit since the conflict began - at a time when hostilities have been paused by a deal to release hostages captured by Hamas. Mr Blinken accepted that Israel planned to resume its military operation, but he also "underscored the imperative for the United States that the massive loss of civilian life and displacement of the scale that we saw in northern Gaza not be repeated in the south".Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October killed 1,200 people with around 240 others taken hostage. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says Israel has killed more than 14,800 Palestinians in its retaliatory campaign, including about 6,000 children. Israeli military strikes have hit hospitals and schools and rendered northern Gaza a moonscape of destruction. The unfolding devastation has shifted the approach of President Joe Biden's administration, from unequivocal support for Israel right after the attack, to a growing emphasis on civilian protection and a focus on alleviating the desperate humanitarian conditions in Gaza.  That evolution has been propelled by anger from Arab allies, and significant dissent to Mr Biden's policies within the administration itself.Senior officials had been previewing Mr Blinken's message for a more surgical approach when Israel focuses its offensive on southern Gaza, where more than 1.5 million Palestinians have fled to escape bombing in the north. Further displacement of Palestinians would be "beyond the capacity of any humanitarian support network to cope with", said one. He clarified that safe zones needed to involve multiple places near UN facilities and shelters, not a single area for the mass relocation of civilians, as initially proposed by the Israeli government. They will be more like neighbourhood de-confliction zones, said another official after Mr Blinken's meetings.  The secretary of state also underlined that there must be room to sustain and build on the humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza. But he avoided a question about whether he'd imposed a timeline for the military operation, stating instead that Israel agreed with the US approach. He said Washington supported Israel's goal to neutralise the threat posed by Hamas, and highlighted the complexity of such a task when the Palestinian militants are embedded amongst the civilian population. Earlier this week the administration clarified that it was not prepared to use its ultimate leverage - placing conditions on America's massive military assistance to Israel - which is powering the war. This is what a dozen or so Democratic senators were told when they questioned whether Israel's use of the weaponry complied with American law, according to one who attended a meeting with the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. A senior US official said threatening aid to Israel was not an effective approach, but its leaders pay attention to what the US says.  The emphasis has been for President Biden to use his influence as Israel's strongest ally to privately push Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on humanitarian issues. Mr Blinken has been unusually public about this. The next phase of the war will reveal whether Israel has got the message.  	
01/12/2023 16:04:00	Israel-Gaza: Londoner loses 42 family members - BBC News	A Palestinian woman who lost 42 relatives in a Gaza bomb strike has said she wants to bring her surviving loved ones to safety in London. Khitam Attaallah Elian, from west London, was told more than half of her relatives had been killed in the middle of the night when her sister's home was destroyed.Her sister-in-law, two nieces and nephew survived.Mrs Attaallah Elian has now flown to Egypt to help as much as she can.Recalling the night she was told of their deaths in the bombing on 21 November, Mrs Attaallah Elian told the BBC: "My daughter came to my room and turned on the light. She said, 'Mama, Aunt Ayah's house has been bombed'."I couldn't understand the news and started screaming. My daughter and husband tried to calm me down and I was asking, 'All of them? All of them?'"Her family were among the first to leave their homes in Gaza since the outbreak of the most recent Israel-Gaza conflict.They moved to her sister's house in the Al- Nuseirat area of central Gaza.She said: "Forty-two of my close family - including my parents, my brothers and sisters, their children and grandchildren - all of them when they were peacefully asleep, suddenly gone."Although she is grieving the loss of many of her family, Mrs Attaallah Elian said she is now focused on bringing her surviving relatives to the UK, because she is a resident here.She said she has contacted a lawyer and was "trying to put in a request to the British government but they don't have foreign passports so they can't get out".Speaking to the BBC from Egypt, Mrs Attaallah Elian added that if there was ever peace in the future, she wanted to say goodbye to her family properly."I also want to go to Gaza once the war ends, even for a couple of days, to see where my family is buried and where their graves are; to give them a last hug."Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

01/12/2023 13:22:00	Sultan al-Jaber: A quick guide to the COP28 president - BBC News	Sultan al-Jaber has been making headlines since being appointed president of this year's UN climate summit. Here's what you need to know.He is an engineer, businessman and politician from the United Arab Emirates (UAE).As chair of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc), Sultan al-Jaber leads a company that pumped 2.7m barrels of oil a day in 2021, with plans to double that by 2027.Mr Jaber has denied a BBC News report that he planned to use the COP presidency as an opportunity to strike oil and gas deals with 15 nations. His view is that fossil fuels are the heart of the climate crisis so it makes sense to persuade that industry to change from the inside. "Never in history has a COP president confronted the oil industry, let alone the fact that he's a CEO of an oil company," he told the Guardian.He is also the ideal person to push for action, he argues, because as chairman of state renewable energy company Masdar, he has overseen the expansion of clean technologies like wind and solar power.They object to someone whose day job is extracting more fossil fuels also being responsible for trying to secure game-changing climate deals.Greta Thunberg described the appointment as "completely ridiculous" and said it called into question the entire UN climate process.More than 130 lawmakers from the US and EU wrote to the UN calling for his removal.The UK government defended Mr Jaber, with Minister for Net Zero Graham Stuart describing him as "an outstanding individual". Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, says Mr Jaber's team is "uniquely placed" to persuade the fossil fuel industry to buy into a green energy future.Countries committed at least $420m for areas suffering the effects of global warming, in what Mr Jaber described as a "unique, unprecedented achievement" and a "very good start" for the summit. "We have delivered history today," he told delegates to widespread applause as the motion passed on the first day of COP28, three decades after the idea was first mooted. Mr Jaber also urged countries to promise to make deeper cuts to their emissions, work together to triple renewable power and double energy efficiency.Mr Jaber is currently the Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology of the UAE. He has also held other cabinet minister roles and has been the country's chief climate diplomat since 2020. As chairman of the National Media Council from 2015-2020, he oversaw the UAE's media, which ranks poorly on press freedom.Born in 1973, the 50-year-old oil exec is not a member of any of the six ruling families of the seven Emirates but has risen up the ranks of Emirati society.	
01/12/2023 12:40:00	Why has the Gaza ceasefire come to an end? - BBC News	Fighting resumed between Israel and Hamas on Friday morning, ending a seven-day ceasefire between the two sides that had seen hostages and prisoners released and much-needed humanitarian assistance reaching the Gaza Strip. Here's a look at some of the key questions around the latest developments. An hour before the ceasefire was due to end at 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT), the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that sirens were sounding for communities close to the Gaza Strip - it then said it had intercepted a rocket fired from the enclave. An hour later, Israel's military said fighting had resumed, accusing Hamas of violating the terms of the agreement. The IDF then said its fighter jets were striking Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip. Shortly after, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas had not "met its obligation to release all of the women hostages today and has launched rockets at Israeli citizens".However, Hamas blamed Israel for the resumption in fighting, saying it refused "to accept all offers to release other hostages". "The occupation had a prior decision to resume the criminal aggression," it said in a statement, blaming US President Joe Biden for "the continuation of Zionist war crimes in the Gaza Strip" and "giving the green light to Israel". Throughout the week-long ceasefire, Mr Netanyahu has come under pressure, particularly from right-wing elements in his government, to re-start the war - something Israel has continually made clear it intended to do once the agreement had come to an end.  Despite this, there are still hopes that a new agreement could be reached. Qatar, which has played a crucial role so far in negotiations over a ceasefire, confirmed on Friday that talks were continuing "with the aim of returning to a pause". Within seven hours of the fighting resuming, the Hamas-run health ministry said more than 60 people had been killed, adding to the nearly 15,000 Palestinians it said were killed before the ceasefire. James Elder from Unicef, the UN children's agency, spoke to the BBC from a hospital in southern Gaza after the bombing started, describing the situation as "terrifying". He said it was "horrendous for people" and that "you see the fear on their faces", adding that a strike had hit close to the facility he was in. He described the end of the ceasefire as "the nightmare that everyone utterly feared". Before the ceasefire, the Gaza Strip had undergone widespread destruction as Israel conducted its retaliatory campaign in response to Hamas's deadly 7 October attacks. Israel claimed to have used more than 10,000 bombs and missiles, and BBC analysis found that almost 98,000 buildings in Gaza may have suffered damage, with most concentrated in the north. The strikes also brought humanitarian aid to a halt. Aid agencies were able to use the pause in fighting to get crucial assistance in, but reported finding devastation in many of the areas they reached. Although negotiations continue in the hope of a new deal being reached, for now it's clear that the war has resumed. After weeks of intense fighting in the north of the Gaza Strip - particularly around Gaza City - Israel's military now appears to be focussing much of its attention on the south, where renewed air strikes have been reported. The IDF has also created a map of Gaza divided into more than 2,000 zones, which it said will be used to help people in Gaza escape future fighting. It said the map is split into areas to enable people to "evacuate from specific places for their safety if required". On Friday, Israeli jets dropped leaflets over areas east and north of Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, linking to the map. The flyers did not refer to any of the numbered blocks, but a message in Arabic told residents in four named - but not numbered - areas to "evacuate immediately and go to shelters in Rafah". The renewed fighting comes after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli officials, where he insisted the next stage of the war must ensure civilians are protected. Mr Blinken said he had told the Israeli government that it must avoid further mass displacement of Palestinians and damage to critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, power stations and water facilities. During the seven-day ceasefire, Hamas agreed to release 110 people from Gaza, including 78 Israeli women and children. As part of the deal, 240 Palestinians were also released from Israeli jails. They had been accused of a range of offences, from throwing stones to incitement and attempted murder. Many of the Palestinians released had not been convicted of crimes, and were being held on remand while awaiting trial. Some said they had been subjected to abuse and collective punishment after the 7 October attacks. Israel says all its prisoners are detained according to the law.It is estimated that about 140 Israeli hostages remain in captivity in Gaza. 	
01/12/2023 11:08:00	Who are the released hostages? - BBC News	A total of 110 hostages, taken prisoner during the 7 October attacks on Israel, have now been released.Seventy-eight of them are Israeli women and children, who were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas.Three Russian-Israelis, two women and one man not included in the deal, have also been handed over.Five Israelis had already been released in October. Twenty-three Thai hostages and one Filipino were freed as part of a separate deal between Hamas and the Thai government.Under the deal between Hamas and Israel, 180 Palestinians have been released from Israeli jails. A six-day ceasefire, which has now ended, also allowed hundreds of lorries of humanitarian aid, medical supplies and fuel into Gaza.  Mia Schem, 21, holds dual French-Israeli nationality. She appeared in the first hostage video released by Hamas saying that she had been abducted from the Supernova festival. Amit Soussana, 40, a lawyer, was at home with a fever when Hamas attacked Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Her family told the Times of Israel she had messaged to say she could hear shooting and was going to hide in her safe room. Aisha Zyadna, 16, and her brother Bilal, 18, have been released, but their brother Hamza, and their father, remain in captivity. Nili Margalit, 41, a nurse, had been kidnapped from her home in Kibbutz Nir Oz.Shani Goren, 29, was also taken from Nir Oz and later seen by family members in a video posted by Hamas. The granddaughter of Uruguayan nationals, she was granted citizenship following her abduction. Uruguay told local media it had been working for her release. Ilana Gritzewsky 30, was taken hostage from Nir Oz along with her Israeli partner, Matan Zanguaker, according to Ilana's father. Ilana arrived in Israel from Mexico 14 years ago. Matan remains a hostage. Raya Rotem, 54, was released on Wednesday 29 November, a few days after her daughter Hila Rotem Shoshani, 13. They had been kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri.Itay Regev, 18, and his sister, Maya Regev, 21, have both now been released. They were taken from the Supernova music festival. The family had previously spotted Itay in a Hamas video, wearing handcuffs in the back of a vehicle.Amit Shani, 16, was the only member of his family taken when Hamas gunmen broke into his family's safe room in Kibbutz Be'eri.Also taken from Be'eri was Ofir Engel, 18, an Israeli-Dutch national, who was visiting his girlfriend, Yuval, when Hamas arrived. He was abducted along with Yuval's father, Yosi Sharabi, 51, and her uncle, Eli Sharabi, 55. They remain in captivity. Eli's wife and two daughters were murdered in the attack. Gali Tarshansky, 13, had also been kidnapped from Be'eri. Her brother, Lior, was killed in the attack.Yarden Roman-Gat, a 36-year-old German-Israeli citizen, has been reunited with her husband and young child after being abducted from Be'eri. Her husband Alon, and three-year-old Gefen managed to escape, but Yarden became separated from them.Raz Ben Ami, 57, and Moran Stella Yanai, 40, were confirmed as having been released on 29 November. Liat Atzili, 49, a dual US-Israeli citizen was also released. Sapir Cohen, 29, was kidnapped along with her partner Alexander (Sasha) Trupanov who is still held captive by Hamas. She was released a day after his mother and grandmother, Lena Trupanov, 50, and Irena Tati, 73, were freed. Both older women held dual Russian-Israeli nationality, and Hamas said their release was a "tribute" to Russian President Vladimir Putin - who refused to condemn the group following the 7 October attacks - and not part of the deal with Israel.Hamas also released another Russian-Israeli on the same grounds. Roni Krivoi, 25, was working as a sound engineer at the Supernova music festival when he was kidnapped.Three members of an Argentinian-Israeli family were released together. Mia Leimberg, 17, her mother Gabriela, 59, and Mia's aunt Clara Marman, 63, were taken from Nir Yitzhak. Gabriela and Clara's brother Fernando Simon Marman, and Clara's partner Louis Har, have not been released.Sharon Aloni Cunio, 34, and her three-year-old twin daughters Ema and Yuly, have been released, but David Cunio, Sharon's husband and father of the two girls, remains in Gaza. The four were kidnapped from Nir Oz along with Sharon's sister, Daniele Aloni, and her six-year-old daughter Emilia.  Both have now been released.Or Yaakov, 16, and his younger brother Yagil, who turned 13 during captivity, were freed, but their father Yair Yaakov, 59, remains a hostage.

What we know about Israel-Hamas hostage dealPrior to the deal struck between Israel and Hamas, four hostages were released, and another was freed by Israeli forces:Twenty foreign workers have been released during the ceasefire. Nineteen of these are from Thailand. Boonthom Pankhong, 39, and his girlfriend, Natthawaree Mulakan, were released by Hamas on 24 November. Boonthom's sister Urai Chantachart told BBC Thai that the family was "overjoyed". "Our family has been suffering for over a month, but we never thought he was dead. We strongly believed that he [was] still alive," she said. She added he had been working in Israel for five years when he was kidnapped, and was the family's main breadwinner. It was initially feared Wichai Kalapat was among the Thai nationals killed in the Hamas raid until his girlfriend received word that he was being held hostage in Gaza. She told the BBC she was "so happy" because she did not think he would be among those who were released.Seven other hostages were also released on the same day. Their names are Uthai Thunsri, Buddee Saengboon, Bancha Kongmanee, Withoon Phumee, Mongkhol Phajuabboon, Santi Boonphrom, and Uthai Sangnuan. Natthaphon Onkaew, Khomkrit Chombua were among the four Thai nationals released on 25 November, according to the country's prime minister, Srettha Thavisin. Anucha Angkaew was also freed. His wife, Wanida Maarsa, told BBC Thai that her husband, who had been working on an avocado farm for almost two years, was one of those taken captive by Hamas militants.The fourth person released was Manee Jirachat, who travelled to Israel for work four years ago. He was seized by Hamas along with five other workers who had taken cover together, according to a Thai TV interview with his father, who had spoken to survivors.It was announced on 26 November that Wichian Temthong, Surin Kesungnoen and Phonsawan Pinakalo had been freed. Two more Thai hostages were released on Tuesday 28 November - O-wat Suriyasri and Pattanayuth Tonsokri - and four were released the next day. Their names are Piboon Rattanil, Kong Saelao, Jakrapan Sikena and Chalermchai Sangkaew.Gelienor "Jimmy" Leano Pacheco, 33, from the Philippines, was also released as part of the same deal. The father of three had been working in Israel as a caregiver to 80-year-old Amita Ben Zvi, who was killed in the attack on Nir Oz.	
02/12/2023 18:06:00	Israel-Gaza live news: Residents of Khan Younis say Israeli strikes heaviest since start of war - BBC News		
01/12/2023 00:59:00	Released Palestinians allege abuse in Israeli jails - BBC News	Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails say that guards carried out abuse and collective punishment in the weeks after the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October.They have described being hit with sticks, having muzzled dogs set on them, and their clothes, food and blankets taken away.One female prisoner has said she was threatened with rape, and that guards twice tear-gassed inmates inside the cells.The BBC spoke to six people in total, all of whom said they were beaten before leaving jail.The Palestinian Prisoners Society says some guards are alleged to have urinated on handcuffed prisoners. And that six prisoners have died in Israeli custody in the past seven weeks.Israel says all its prisoners are detained according to the law.Eighteen-year-old Mohammed Nazzal was one of those released by Israel this week, in exchange for Israeli women and children held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.He had been held in custody in Nafha Prison without charge since August, and says he does not know why he was arrested.Mohammed invited me to his home, down a winding alley in the village of Qabatiya near Jenin, in the north of the occupied West Bank.The family reception room at the top of the old house was fogged by the smoke of a dozen cigarettes - a cousin circled the visitors with a flask of coffee and a tall tower of tiny paper cups.Mohammed sat flanked by rows of male relatives, both his hands heavily bandaged, held up in front of him stiffly like a boxer, the tip of his thumbs peeking out.Ten days ago, he says, Israeli prison guards came into his cell with a microphone and speaker, and tried to provoke the prisoners by clapping and screaming their names."When they saw we weren't reacting," he says, "they started to beat us.""They arranged us so that the elderly prisoners were put in the back and the young in front. They took me and started beating me. I was trying to protect my head, and they were trying to break my legs and my hands."The family showed us medical reports and X-rays from Palestinian doctors in Ramallah who examined Mohammed after he was released on Monday.We showed the X-ray pictures to two doctors in the UK, who confirmed that they showed fractures in both hands. It was no surprise to Mohammed."In the beginning, I was in a lot of pain," he tells me. "Then after a while, I knew that they were broken, so I stopped using them. I only used them when I went to the toilet."He says the other prisoners helped him eat, drink and use the bathroom, and that he did not ask the guards for medical help out of fear that he would be beaten again.The Israel Prison Service has disputed Mohammed's story, saying that he had been examined by a medic before leaving prison, with no medical problem diagnosed.The prison service also released a video of the teenager leaving prison and boarding a Red Cross bus before his release, which it says proves that his claims are false.In the footage, the teenager's hands are unbandaged, and appear to be hanging by his sides - including as he climbs onto the bus - but are out of shot for most of the video.Mohammed told us that the first medical treatment he received was on that Red Cross bus.A medical report from a hospital in Ramallah the day he arrived back home advised that a plate might have to be fitted, if his fractures did not heal by themselves.We asked the Red Cross to confirm Mohammed's story. They said in a statement: "We speak directly with the detaining authorities if we have any concerns about the medical condition of detainees. Due to this dialogue, we do not speak publicly about individual cases."Mohammed says the behaviour of guards inside Israeli jails changed after the Hamas attacks on 7 October.He says guards kicked them, and used sticks to hit them, and describes one guard stepping on his face."They came in with their dogs," he continues. "They let the dogs attack us and then they started beating us.""They took out mattresses, our clothes, our pillows, and they threw our food on the floor. People were terrified."He shows me the marks on his back and shoulder that he says were the result of these beatings."The dog attacking me wore a muzzle with very sharp edges - his muzzle and claws left marks all over my body," he tells me.Beatings like this happened twice at Megiddo Prison, he says, and more times than he could count at Nafha Prison.Other Palestinian prisoners we have spoken to have described a similar shift inside Israel's jails after the Hamas attacks, saying they understood it as "revenge" against Palestinian prisoners for the actions of Hamas.The head of the Palestinian Prisoners Society, Abdullah al-Zaghary, told us that many prisoners had witnessed cellmates being violently beaten on their faces and bodies, and that he had heard allegations of guards urinating on handcuffed prisoners.We asked the Israel Prison Service for a response to these allegations. They said all prisoners were detained according to the law and had all the basic rights legally required."We are not aware of the claims you described," the statement said. "Nonetheless, prisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined by official authorities."Lama Khater, released from prison earlier this week, published a video on social media alleging that an intelligence officer had "explicitly threatened her with rape" immediately after her arrest in late October."I was handcuffed and blindfolded," she told an interviewer in the video. "They threatened to rape me... It was clear the goal was to intimidate me."Israel said these claims were made by her lawyer and had been denied by the prisoner herself. The prison service had filed a complaint for incitement, it said.But Lama Khater told us by telephone that women prisoners - including herself - had indeed been threatened with rape, and that tear gas had been used against prisoners in their dormitory at Damon Prison.The Palestinian Prisoners Society says there has been a sharp rise in the number of Palestinian deaths in custody since the 7 October attacks, with six people dying in jail since that date.Israel did not address our question about this directly, but said that four prisoners had died on four different dates over the past weeks, and that the prison service had no knowledge of the causes of death.In Qabatiya village, Mohammed Nazzal says his hands still give him pain, especially at night.His brother Mutaz told me the teenager he knew before had not returned from jail."This is not the Mohammed we know," he said. "He was brave, courageous. Now his heart is broken and filled with terror."The previous night, he said, the Israeli army had carried out an operation in the city of Jenin, 4km (2.5 miles) away: "You could see how scared he was."Additional reporting by Scarlett Barter.	
30/11/2023 22:45:00	Three Israelis killed by Palestinian gunmen at Jerusalem bus stop - BBC News	Three Israelis were killed and several others injured when two Palestinian gunmen opened fire at a bus stop in West Jerusalem, Israeli police say.Video showed the gunmen getting out of a car on a highway and shooting at people - in an attack claimed by Hamas.Off-duty soldiers and a civilian at the scene killed the attackers, who police said were from occupied East Jerusalem.Local media said a fourth civilian who had mistaken for an attacker and shot by the troops died later died.In its statement saying that two assailants were its members, Hamas said Thursday morning's attack was a response to Israeli "crimes" in Gaza and elsewhere.Israel launched a major military campaign in Gaza after an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen almost eight weeks ago, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 240 taken hostage.Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 15,000 people have been killed in the territory since the war began.A deal mediated by Qatar has led to a pause in the fighting in Gaza since last Friday. The Jerusalem attack came hours after the Palestinian armed group - which Israel, the UK, US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation - agreed with Israel to extend a truce in Gaza for a seventh day, and to allow another exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.Eight hostages were released from Gaza on Thursday. Two women - Mia Schem and Amit Soussana - were initially released, followed by a group of six others.Qatar - a key mediator in the deal - said two Russian-Israeli women released on Wednesday had been included in the following day's tally, meaning the expected number of 10 was reached.It reiterated that a further 30 Palestinians were due to be released from Israeli jails in return. Talks have continued in an effort to further prolong the pause in the war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on his third trip to the Middle East since fighting broke out with Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October. In a press conference in Tel Aviv on Thursday evening, Mr Blinken called on Israel to put in place "safe" zones for Palestinian civilians in central and southern Gaza before resuming any military operations.The point, he said, was to "minimise further casualties of innocent Palestinians".Mr Blinken earlier commented on the attack in West Jerusalem, calling it a reminder "of the threat from terrorism that Israel and Israelis face every single day".Israeli President Isaac Herzog told his American visitor that the incident was another example of an "endless war" Israel was fighting in "very complicated and challenging times".In their account of the attack, Israeli police said they received reports of gunfire at Givat Shaul junction, on the main highway from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, at about 07:40 on Thursday (05:40 GMT)."A car approached with two armed terrorists - one with an M16 rifle and the other with a handgun," Jerusalem District Commander Doron Turgeman told reporters at the scene."At a bus stop they opened fire at people who were waiting there," he said. "The quick response of two soldiers and a civilian, who were close to the stop, neutralised the attackers."  A large amount of ammunition was later found by officers who searched the gunmen's vehicle.Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance service paramedic Moshe Hemed rushed to the scene."I saw a number of casualties... Some were lying and some were walking. Along with large numbers of MDA teams we assessed and treated them," he said."Unfortunately, we had to pronounce a 24-year-old female deceased, and evacuated a further eight casualties in varying conditions to hospitals across the city."Later, police announced that two other victims of the attack had died and that three more were in a serious condition in hospital.Israel media identified the 24-year-old woman as Livia Dickman, and the two others killed as Rabbi Elimelech Wasserman, 73, and Hana Ifergan, who was in her 60s.Late on Thursday evening, reports said a fourth civilian had died - after being fired on by soldiers who mistook him for an attacker himself. Haaretz reported that the unnamed civilian, in his 40s, was seen in security footage telling soldiers not to shoot, before he was shot. Israeli officials have not yet commented.Police said the attackers were two brothers in their 30s from the Sur Baher area of East Jerusalem. The Shin Bet security service named them as Murad and Ibrahim Namer, and said they were affiliated to Hamas and had previously served prison sentences for involvement in terrorist activities - according to Israeli media.Visiting the site of the attack, far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said: "Hamas is speaking with two voices here."This event proves again how we must not show weakness, that we must speak to Hamas only through the [rifle] scopes, only through the war."Mr Ben-Gvir also said the Israeli government would continue to ease regulations for issuing gun licences to citizens.Hamas later confirmed that two members of its military wing had carried out the attack, calling it a "natural response to unprecedented crimes conducted by the (Israeli) occupation". It cited the killing of Palestinians in the Gaza war and during Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank, as well as the treatment of Palestinian prisoners.During Qatar-mediated truce, Hamas has freed dozens of Israeli women and children among its hostages, while Israel has released 210 Palestinian women and youths from its jails. Twenty-three Thai hostages and one Filipino have also been released as part of a separate deal between Hamas and the Egyptian government.Before the truce, four Israeli hostages had been released - and Israeli forces in Gaza had rescued one hostage and recovered the bodies of two others.	
30/11/2023 22:14:00	Mia Schem: Wounded festival-goer in Hamas hostage video freed - BBC News	A wounded festival-goer is among the latest hostages released from Gaza - having appeared in a video by Hamas after its 7 October attack on Israel.Israeli-French tattoo artist Mia Schem, 21, was freed with another woman, followed later by six others.The seven-day truce has so far seen 105 people released from Gaza. Israel is expected to release another 30 Palestinians prisoners on Thursday.Hamas took about 240 hostages, with many taken from the Supernova festival.Ms Schem was among them, and became the first person to appear in a Hamas hostage video on 16 October. Images on Thursday showed Schem being handed to humanitarian organisation the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) - along with Amit Soussana, a 40-year-old lawyer.Six others were released later the same day, including a pair of teenage siblings. Qatar - a key mediator in the deal - said two Russian-Israeli women released on Wednesday had been included in the following day's tally, meaning Thursday's expected number of 10 was reached.It reiterated that 30 more Palestinian prisoners were also set for release on Thursday under the deal. Advocacy group the Palestinian Prisoners Club earlier said they comprised 22 children and eight women.Meanwhile, mediators are continuing with efforts to further extend the pause in fighting - to allow more hostages to leave Gaza and more aid to enter.Speaking on his third visit to the Middle East since the war broke out last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he wanted to see the truce extended.But, he warned, if Israel was to restart its military campaign, it had to take effective steps to ensure the protection of civilians in Gaza.The images of Schem published on Thursday represented the first glimpse of her since the emergence of the Hamas footage last month - which showed her with an injured arm being treated while she was in captivity.That video was condemned by the French government, and prompted Schem's mother Keren to hold a news conference in Tel Aviv calling for her daughter's immediate release.Family video - published in Israeli media on Thursday - showed Keren weeping with joy at the news of her daughter's release, exclaiming: "Mia's coming back!"Schem's father David gave his own reaction to Israel's Channel 12 TV: "It's the happiest day in the world; she's an amazing girl. I'm not going to leave her for a long period."French President Emmanuel Macron described Schem's release as a source of "great joy".The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said Schem's friend Elia Toledano remained in captivity, having also been abducted from the Supernova musical festival on 7 October.The organisation described Schem as being "full of joy for life, and with a huge heart". It also saluted her "fighting spirit".It also gave details about the other woman released on Thursday, lawyer Amit Soussana.Ms Soussana lives by herself in Kfar Aza kibbutz, and was kidnapped while hiding in her shelter. She is said to be a fan of rock music and tennis, and has three cats. The six others later released from Gaza included siblings Bilal, 18, and Aisha Alziadana, 17.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said their father and brother were also take hostage, and remain captives of Hamas.It also said Mexican-born Ilana Gritzewsky, 30, had also been freed, as had Saphir Cohen, 29 - but the two women's partners were also still being held as hostages in Gaza. Twenty-nine-year old Shani Goren - said to have been kidnapped with her dog - was also returned to Israel, along with Nili Margalit, 41, who works as a paediatric nurse.Before Thursday's expected release, a total of 210 Palestinian prisoners had been released from Israeli jails.Among the latest were prominent activist Ahed Tamimi, 22, who became a symbol of resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank while she was a teenager. She was arrested earlier this month over an Instagram post, which her family say she did not write.Those freed from Israeli prisons have been chosen from an original list of 300 Palestinians compiled by Israel. They had been accused of a range of offences, from throwing stones to incitement to attempted murder.Fewer than a quarter of those on the list had been convicted; the vast majority were being held on remand while awaiting trial.	
30/11/2023 20:21:00	Israel recalls ambassador in war spat with Spain PM Pedro Sánchez - BBC News	Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has deepened a diplomatic row with Israel after he said he had "serious doubts that Israel is complying with international humanitarian law".His comments came days after he accused Israel of "indiscriminate killing of Palestinians" during its military operation in the Gaza Strip.Israel has condemned his latest remarks as outrageous.Israel says it aims to eliminate Hamas following its deadly attack on Israel.At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage as militants broke through the border fence between Israel and Gaza on 7 October.Since then, more than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's retaliation, the Hamas-run health ministry says.For the second time in a week, Spain's ambassador to Israel was summoned for a rebuke."Israel is acting, and will continue to act, according to international law, and will continue the war until all the hostages are returned and Hamas is eliminated from Gaza," Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen posted on X.In response to what he called the latest "baseless accusations" by the Spanish leader, Mr Cohen said he had decided to recall Israel's ambassador to Madrid, Rodica Radian-Gordon, for consultations.Mr Sánchez won a new term as prime minister only two weeks ago but he has become one of the most outspoken critics among EU leaders of Israel's response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October. His left-wing government is made up of his Socialist party, the left-wing Sumar alliance and pro-independence Catalans.Ahead of last week's visit to Israel and the West Bank, he told parliament that his new government would work both in Europe and Spain to recognise a Palestinian state. Spain currently holds the EU presidency.He then travelled to Israel with Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, telling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that while he defended Israel's right to defend itself, the number of Palestinian casualties was "truly unbearable". Israel accused the two prime ministers of failing to place "full responsibility for the crimes against humanity committed by Hamas", adding that their "false claims... give support to terrorism". Both countries' ambassadors were summoned for a reprimand. Spain's foreign minister rejected the Israeli accusations and in turn summoned Israel's ambassador.On his return to Spain, Mr Sánchez was criticised by domestic political opponents for giving "classes in morality". Madrid's centre-right regional leader Isabel Díaz Ayuso said that his "embarrassing" position was creating a wall separating Spain from Israel, US and the West.His latest intervention, during an interview with Spanish public broadcaster TVE, was derided by the Israeli prime minister's office for coming hours after Hamas gunmen shot dead three Israelis at a crowded bus stop on the outskirts of Jerusalem. The attackers got out of a car on a highway and opened fire with a rifle and a pistol.The Spanish prime minister said the footage from Gaza of people dying, especially boys and girls, was "not acceptable" and he repeated his belief that a solution to the crisis required "recognition of the Palestinian state". He said it was in Europe's interest to address "out of moral conviction"."Friendly countries also have to tell each other the truth," he insisted.	
30/11/2023 18:20:00	Liat Beinin Atzili: US citizen among 16 Hamas hostages released - BBC News	A dual US-Israeli citizen held hostage in Gaza has been released as part of a temporary ceasefire between Hamas and Israel. The hostage, Liat Beinin Atzili, was taken from her home in Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel on 7 October. She was among 12 Israeli and four Thai hostages released by Hamas on Wednesday.Eight other US citizens are believed still to be in captivity. Ms Atzili's release was confirmed by the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum and US President Joe Biden. "I talked with her mother and father. They're very appreciative, and things are moving well," Mr Biden said. "She'll soon be home with her three children."It was believed Ms Atzili's husband Aviv was being held hostage as well after her release, Kibbutz Nir Oz announced on Friday that he had been killed on 7 October. His death has yet to be confirmed by US or Israeli officials. "May his soul rest in peace," Kibbutz Nir Oz said in a Facebook post announcing Aviv's death. They said he was the "backbone of the Nir Oz community", a "painter, cyclist, lover of people and land". Thirty Palestinians held by Israel were also released on Wednesday as part of the Qatari-mediated ceasefire deal. About 1,200 people were killed and some 240 hostages taken when Hamas raided Israel on 7 October. Mrs Atzili, 49, is a teacher at a school near Gaza and youth guide at Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to victims of the Holocaust. Dani Dayan, chairman of Yad Vashem, called for the release of more than 100 hostages still in captivity as well as Mrs Atzili's Yad Vashem colleague Alex Dancyg, a historian and Holocaust educator.In a November interview with Politico, Ms Atzili's father, Yehuda Beinin, said she reported that the situation on 7 October was "crazy" and that one of her friends recorded a conversation with her shortly before she was abducted. "You can hear the desperation in her voice as to the situation around her house," he said. "I've never heard her speak like this. It was very, very desperate, very low tone of voice. She may very well have been trying to be quiet, not to make noise." "That was basically the last anybody heard from her," Mr Beinin added. A statement from the Israeli security forces says the released hostages arrived back in Israeli territory via Egypt - accompanied by special forces troops. The statement says the group will undergo medical tests, before being taken to hospitals - where they will be reunited with their families.The group included three women with German-Israeli nationality and a minor with Dutch-Israeli nationality. Earlier, two Russian-Israeli citizens were released. Another US hostage, four-year-old Abigail Edan, was released earlier this week. Two other US hostages, Judith and Natalie Raanan, were released by Hamas "for humanitarian reasons" in late October. Eight other Americans are believed to be in captivity, the White House said earlier this week. In a statement on Wednesday, President Biden said the US is "determined to secure the release of every person taken hostage by Hamas during its brutal terrorist assault on Israel on October 7". Wednesday marked the sixth day of a truce between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Talks are ongoing in an effort to extend the ceasefire before it expires. "The deal has delivered meaningful results," Mr Biden said. "Nearly 100 hostages have been returned to their loved ones. And the United States has led the international community to use this pause to accelerate the delivery of additional humanitarian assistance into Gaza."	
30/11/2023 17:15:00	Dundee mother feels 'helpless' as daughter trapped in Gaza - BBC News	A Palestinian women who currently lives in Dundee has said she feels "helpless" as her young daughter is trapped in Gaza.Israa Aljaish, 29, said her daughter, Marlin, was suffering "psychological trauma" from the sound of bombing.Ms Aljaish came to Scotland in September 2022 to study for a Masters degree in International Education at the University of St Andrews, and had to leave five-year-old Marlin in the care of her grandmother.She graduated in August and took a job as a postgraduate administrator with the university at the start of October, with plans to bring her daughter to the UK when the Israel-Hamas war began days later.Fears for displaced Gazans as winter approaches and diseases spreadWhat is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza?According to Ms Aljaish's mother, Marlin has experienced trauma as a result of the conflict and is also suffering with fever, a "bad cough" and "no food and limited water".Ms Aljaish told the PA news agency: "I'm here and I can see my daughter is dying every passing day and I'm here doing nothing, I just see that in front of my eyes."I know she has faced some psychological trauma because of the noise of the bombing next to the place they are sheltering in."It's not Marlin as I know Marlin - it's not the same person I knew before."The temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was extended by another day, minutes before it was due to expire on Thursday, with the hope that Hamas will keep freeing hostages in return for the release of Palestinians.Ms Aljaish said her daughter has been suffering nightmares as a result of the conflict.About 1,200 people were killed and some 240 hostages taken when Hamas raided Israel on 7 October.The Israeli military responded with air strikes on Gaza, and launched a ground offensive. More than 14,800 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run government.A pause in fighting to allow the exchange of hostages for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons has been extended again.More than 100,000 people have acute respiratory infections and 80,000 are suffering with diarrhoea, according to the World Health Organization. Half of those are said to be under the age of five.When the war began on 7 October, Ms Aljaish said her family members relocated to southern Gaza from their home in the centre of the Strip.She said: "She( Marlin) hears so many stories and she has terrible nightmares - she told me one of the nightmares was that she saw blood on my head."Her daughter and mother are currently sheltering in a flat with her three brothers, her sister-in-law, her two nieces and her nephew.She hoper her mother will be able to get to Egypt with her daughter and she can meet them there.Ms Aljaish set up a GoFundMe page to raise money to secure an accelerated visa for her daughter to be able to leave Gaza at a cost of around £1,500.She said she is in the process of applying for it, but added her daughter won't be able to leave without her grandmother, for fear of her facing "shock" and further trauma.Ms Aljaish hopes the UK government will support her case in order to relocate her daughter to Scotland, where she said she believes Marlin can find "safety, security and a chance for a better future".Her fundraiser, organised by one of her friends in the UK, has reached its target and raised more than £3,000 which prompted her to close the donations page for the time being.Liberal Democrat MP, Wendy Chamberlain, has raised the case in parliament and said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was "perilous".“It is hard to imagine how difficult it is for Israa to be separated from her young daughter in the current circumstances.“My team and I have been pursuing every option to reunite this family. We have engaged with the Foreign Office and the Home Office, and I have raised Israa’s case in parliament.“This is far from a straightforward process but continue to hope that a solution can be found and the government can be convinced to step in.”	
30/11/2023 14:22:00	Bedouin family desperate for news on teenagers held hostage in Gaza - BBC News	Each evening, Naeema Zyadna waits for the phone to ring. Since the Israel-Hamas temporary truce deal began last week, she's been expecting word that her children who were taken hostage by Hamas - 16-year-old Aisha and 18-year-old Bilal - are coming home. But they haven't yet.There are only a handful of child hostages left inside Gaza. Under the agreement struck between Israel and Hamas, under-19s were supposed to be released from captivity. On the sixth day, five more were freed, and almost 40 have now been returned home in total. But so far, Aisha and Bilal haven't been among them. Naeema told me she desperately hopes to feel that happiness herself, and can't understand why it hasn't happened yet. With just minutes until the ceasefire was due to end on Thursday morning the deal was extended again, for a seventh day. The publication of each additional hostage list brings fresh hope that her children's names will be on it.On the morning of 7 October, Aisha and Bilal had gone with their father - Naeema's husband, Yousef  - to work in a cowshed near the Israel-Gaza perimeter. Another son joined them, 22-year-old Hamza. Aisha was only there to have a picnic with her father. All four were kidnapped. The Zyadna family live in a modest Bedouin village in the southern Negev desert, near the city of Rahat. Arabs make up around a fifth of Israel's population, with many of them preferring to be called Palestinian citizens of Israel. Fewer than 10 of the hostages taken by Hamas and other factions in Gaza during the brutal attacks were from the Bedouin community, and double that number are believed to have been killed. A private, nomadic community, their stories of that day have been heard far less than others.Arabic-speaking and Muslim, the Bedouin are fiercely proud of their heritage, and the Zyadnas talk of the difficulties they've faced in trying to protect their culture and their land. Naeema says her faith gives her strength, and describes her belief that the fate of her husband and children is in the hands of Allah.Naeema's eyes fill with tears as we sit and talk outside her home, with the sound of her grandchildren playing nearby. "Why during these 54 days has neither my daughter nor my son been released? Their father wasn't either. Why does Hamas not set them free? Why does Israel not call for their release like it did with others?" she asks. "They are young, in their teens and early 20s. Their father is diabetic and suffers from hypertension. He takes injections. Why were they not released?" Bilal's car sits close to his mother's house. Locked and empty, the family have left it in exactly the same place as he last parked it. They don't want to move it - they're waiting for him to be freed to come back and drive it again himself. Above the small village is a piece of flat land, where a few coloured flags flutter in the wind. It's where marriage ceremonies are normally held, and where the community are hoping to hold a huge party to celebrate the return of their loved ones when they come back home. A short walk away, past a pen filled with curious, chattering white geese, Ali Zyadna sits drinking tiny cups of dark coffee. He is Yousef's brother, and holds up a poster covered with photos of his relatives' faces.  The family shared a photo with us - a dark and distressing contrast to the smiling images from the placard. Taken from Hamas media channels and widely circulated, it shows Bilal and Hamza lying on their stomachs on the ground, the clothing removed from their upper bodies. Two Thai hostages lie close by, and two armed men loom over the group. One points his rifle at the ground with his finger close to the trigger. Extra ammunition is tucked into the green body armour he's wearing, and a Palestinian flag is visible on the front. The other man trains his weapons directly on the captives.Ali's message is clear: "I'm speaking these words so Hamas will hear. I want to ask them to regard this as humanitarian and bring back our kids. They have returned two more Russians without any connection to the agreement. They brought back the Thais without anything in return. What's the problem for them to return the Muslims? We're asking, we're begging, give us back our kids safe and well." Naeema too wants the world to focus on her family, and her Bedouin community, during their ordeal. She knows that telling people stories about her children, of Aisha's love of tea and cake, and Bilal's devotion to his pet horse and dog, is necessary to bring attention to their plight."I'm asking Hamas to bring back my children, enough is enough," she cries, her voice loud and loaded with emotion. "Every night I feel bad, I can't take this any more, I'm losing my mind."Ali wants Israel's leaders to increase their efforts too.  "The government always give us the answer that it's all in the hands of Hamas. But no, you are the state. Insist. You should insist. We're not jealous of anyone, we're happy that they've been returned, may they all come back. But it can't be right that there are adults in the groups who are being returned while a girl is left behind in captivity.""It's very hard for us. It's two months already. We thought they would have come back already. But everyone returned and they didn't. The wives, the women of the family, are crying, they want them home with us."	
30/11/2023 13:50:00	Palestinian activist Ahed Tamimi freed by Israel - BBC News	Activist Ahed Tamimi was one of 30 Palestinian prisoners released by Israel on Wednesday, as part of the truce deal with Hamas.Israel's prison service said a mixture of men and women had been freed "from a number of [its] facilities".Ms Tamimi, 22, was arrested earlier this month over an Instagram post, which her family say she did not write. As of Wednesday night, 102 hostages have been freed, while 210 Palestinian prisoners have been released.Images showed Ms Tamimi, who had been held in Damon Prison, near the Israeli city of Haifa, returned to the West Bank late on Wednesday.The prominent activist was pictured having an emotional reunion with her mother.Other prisoners, whose names have not yet been shared, were also seen reuniting with family members.The social media post Ms Tamimi was detained over is no longer visible online, nor is the account it came from, which carried her name and photo.Israeli media reported that she had threatened to "slaughter" Jewish settlers, but her mother said the account did not belong to her daughter."There are dozens of [online] pages in Ahed's name with her photo, with which she has no connection," she told AFP news agency at the time of her arrest. Israel's military told AFP she was arrested on suspicion of "inciting violence and terrorist activities".As a teenager, Ms Tamimi became a symbol of resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank.When she was 14 years old she was photographed biting an Israeli soldier who was trying to detain her younger brother.Two years later, she was filmed slapping and kicking an Israeli soldier in an altercation outside her home and was subsequently arrested and sentenced to eight months in prison.Her father, Bassem Tamimi, is an activist who used to regularly organise protests against the Israeli occupation and has been repeatedly jailed.Ms Tamimi is one of hundreds of Palestinians who have been arrested in the West Bank since 7 October, when Hamas gunmen from Gaza attacked southern Israel.Israel says the arrests have been made to limit violence during a time when unrest has surged in the West Bank.On Thursday, three Israelis were killed when two Hamas gunmen opened fire at a crowded bus stop in West Jerusalem during morning rush hour.The two attackers had come from occupied East Jerusalem. Sixteen Israelis were injured and the attackers were killed by police and an armed civilian. Earlier on Wednesday, two Palestinian boys, aged eight and 14, were shot and killed during a raid by the Israeli army in the West Bank city of Jenin. The Israeli military said explosive devices were thrown at its soldiers and that they responded with live fire.	
30/11/2023 10:37:00	Israel-Hamas truce in Gaza extended as more hostages freed - BBC News	Israel and Hamas have agreed to extend their truce for another day, minutes before it was due to expire.The temporary ceasefire was extended for a seventh day, shortly before 05:00 GMT, following mediation with Qatar. The deal has led to the release of dozens of hostages kidnapped by Hamas in exchange for Palestinians held in prisons and aid deliveries into Gaza.On Wednesday night, 16 more hostages taken captive by Hamas were released, as were 30 Palestinians.So far, some 102 Israeli hostages have been freed, while 210 Palestinians prisoners have been released. About 140 Israelis remain in captivity. Israel's military said the temporary ceasefire was being extended "in light of the mediators' efforts to continue the process of releasing the hostages and subject to the terms of the framework".The prime minister's office subsequently confirmed the extension, saying it had received a new list of women and children hostages, though it did not specify how many names were on the list.Hamas said there was an agreement to "extend the truce for a seventh day," without giving further details.The initial truce was due to last four days but has been extended twice. When the agreement was negotiated, Israel said the pause in fighting would be extended by one day for every 10 further hostages released. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the truce was "producing results" and should continue."We have seen over the last week the very positive development of hostages coming home, being reunited with their families," he said at a meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv on Thursday. "It's also enabled an increase in humanitarian assistance to go to innocent civilians in Gaza who need it desperately."But on Wednesday Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, repeated earlier pledges to resume the war once the truce ends."There is no way we are not going back to fighting until the end. This is my policy, the entire cabinet stands behind it, the entire government stands behind it, the soldiers stand behind it, the people stand behind it - this is exactly what we will do," he said in a statement on Wednesday.Before the extension was agreed, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the Gaza Strip was in the midst of an "epic humanitarian catastrophe".He welcomed the negotiations to prolong the truce but added that a "true humanitarian ceasefire" was needed. The UN estimates that more than 1.8 million people in Gaza have fled their homes over the past seven weeks. About 60% of them are sheltering in 156 facilities belonging to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa.Earlier this week, World Health Organization spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris said an assessment of those shelters had found outbreaks of infectious diseases, with cases of diarrhoea among children aged five and older more than 100 times normal levels.The truce has allowed a temporary halt to Israeli air strikes that began after 7 October when Hamas launched a major cross-border attack in southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking hundreds hostage. Since then, Israel's air and ground operation into Gaza has killed about 15,000 people, 40% of which are children, according to health ministry officials in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Large parts in the north of the Strip have been demolished or seriously damaged.

29/11/2023 21:54:00	Two Palestinian boys killed during Israeli raid in West Bank - BBC News	Four Palestinians, including two children, have been killed by Israeli forces during a raid in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian officials say.CCTV videos appeared to show eight-year-old Adam al-Ghoul and Basel Abu al-Wafa, 14, being shot during the same incident in the city of Jenin.The Israeli military said suspects threw explosive devices at its soldiers and that they responded with live fire.It also said troops killed "two high-ranking terrorists" during the raid.There has been a surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's attack on southern Israel on 7 October.Footage shows a small figure on a security camera video turning and starting to run, before falling sharply to the ground. His eight-year-old body is easily dragged from the road by a friend.The life of Adam al-Ghoul ended in Jenin on Wednesday with a shot to the head, as Israeli forces withdrew from a military operation in the refugee camp there.Nearby, his 14-year-old friend, Basel Abu al-Wafa was fighting for his life after being shot in the chest, with gunfire hitting the ground around him.At Jenin Hospital, both boys were declared dead.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that during "activity in the Jenin camp, a number of suspects hurled explosive devices toward IDF soldiers". "The soldiers responded with live fire toward the suspects and hits were identified." As Basel's body was prepared for burial in the crowded hospital morgue, a relative watched as the teenager was wrapped in the green flag of Hamas. It wasn't what Basel would have wanted, he told the BBC."He's innocent, not from the militias," he said, teetering between anger and grief. "He's perfect in school, a good boy, kind."  The hospital director, Dr Wissam Bakr, said the boys' wounds - from shots to the head and chest - showed that they were intentionally killed. "There's no safe place in Jenin now," he said.  The war in Gaza has increased tensions here in the West Bank, where there are near-nightly raids by Israel's forces.  In its operations in Jenin overnight, the IDF said it had killed a senior commander for Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Mohammed Zubeidi, and another called Wissam Hanoun who had been inside a building with him. It accused Zubeidi of involvement in two shootings in May in which an Israeli civilian was killed and several soldiers were wounded.Palestinian Islamic Jihad - which like Hamas is classed as a terrorist group by Israel, the UK and other Western powers - confirmed that two of its local commanders were killed.  The IDF also said it had arrested 17 wanted individuals during the raid.Israeli missiles, grenades and explosives have left a broad scar of destruction in Jenin's camp - several houses gutted or collapsed, and large chunks of masonry hanging over mounds of rubble.Diggers were helping search for a body still believed to be buried there.Militant leaders were the target here, killed along with boys of eight and 14.Before the Jenin raid, the UN said that at least 225 Palestinians, including more than 50 children, had been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since 7 October.Adam and Basel are the latest casualties of a conflict that keeps getting older, even as children die.	
29/11/2023 21:11:00	Fears for displaced Gazans as winter approaches and diseases spread - BBC News	In the cramped conditions of a makeshift tent near the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, Nariman cradles her baby daughter. The 23-day-old girl is younger than the war itself and Nariman's whole family is sick."I don't have enough money to buy my daughter medicine even though she needs medical support to help her breathe", says the young mother, wrapped up against the cold of the encroaching winter. "My husband is seriously ill and my young son also needed hospital treatment yesterday."The United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, has said that Gaza is in the midst of an "epic humanitarian catastrophe", and that "the world must not look away".Even if the current pause in hostilities is extended by a few days, Israel has made it clear the military offensive will soon resume, targeting what remains of Hamas' capabilities across Gaza.That, say aid agencies, will exacerbate what is already a dire humanitarian situation, particularly around Khan Younis where thousands of people have sought refuge from the fighting in the north.The fragile truce of the past six days has allowed the UN and others to assess what damage seven weeks of bombing has done and what pressing needs the population now has."We cannot get enough aid in through the Rafah crossing right now as winter approaches," says Thomas White, the director of affairs in Gaza for the United Nations Palestinian Refugee Agency.White, who toured parts of the heavily-bombed Gaza City and the destroyed infrastructure, added: "There's poor sanitation and we're very concerned about an outbreak of infectious diseases such as watery diarrhoea as people are forced to live in very cramped conditions with poor sanitation."The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that, given living conditions and the lack of health care, "more people in Gaza could die from disease than bombings".Over 100,000 people have acute respiratory infections and 80,000 are suffering with diarrhoea, the WHO says. Half of those are said to be under the age of five.Israel has often denied there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza and points to the 200 or so trucks currently being allowed into the territory each day during this truce, bringing in much-need food, medicines and limited fuel supplies. Distributed throughout Gaza, via UN warehouses and collection points, the badly-needed food, medicines and limited fuel is quickly snapped up. It is thought that more than one million Gazans are now living in temporary shelters, having been forced from their homes elsewhere in the besieged Palestinian territory.If and when the bombing resumes, the aid will again be reduced to a trickle and thousands of internally displaced people will face the prospect of having to move on again, to areas with much less aid and even fewer resources.	
29/11/2023 12:59:00	Anger and despair as Palestinians queue for supplies during truce - BBC News	"Where are all Arabs and Muslims? Where are all the defenders of human rights? You've left the Palestinian people to suffer, go hungry and be destroyed."A middle-aged woman rails at the world in a queue for cooking gas in Deir al-Balah, a town in the centre of the Gaza Strip. She shouts angrily in the air, desperation and frustration visible in her face, despair lurking in the background."We've been waiting in line to fill one gas cylinder since early morning. I performed my morning prayers while standing."She tells me that she had to flee her home in Beit Hanoun in the north, just 2km (1.2 miles) from the border with Israel. "I can't describe the destruction. Entire families have been erased from civil records. They were killed under their houses."Gaza has been completely destroyed. Have mercy on us."She is now living with her family at a UN-run school in Deir al-Balah.After Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostage, Israel started air strikes and then launched a ground invasion. At least 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war so far, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Gaza Strip is home to 2.3 million people and the UN says 80% have been displaced by the conflict, with Israel ordering everyone living in the north to evacuate south of the Wadi Gaza river.On Friday, a four-day pause in the fighting began under a deal between Israel and Hamas, which saw 50 of the hostages held in Gaza freed in return for the release of 150 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The two sides later extended the truce for two days from Tuesday to allow an additional 20 hostages and 60 prisoners to be released.The agreement also allowed more aid to be sent to Gaza. Up to 200 aid lorries have been crossing from Egypt each day. But that is still less than half of the number of lorries that entered daily before the war.UN agencies have said they have been able to deliver some of that aid to the north, which has been the focus of the Israeli ground offensive, but there are huge shortages everywhere.There are hundreds in the queue for cooking gas in Deir al-Balah, about 6km south of Wadi Gaza. Young men sit on gas cylinders as they wait. The air is tense. People are exhausted."You can't find a cup of tea or one pack of biscuits. Yesterday, people were sharing bread while sleeping on the street," says another man in the queue."The rain that we witnessed yesterday and the cold we went through. People spent the night here. May God help us."Israel cut off electricity and most water, and stopped deliveries of food, fuel and other goods to Gaza in retaliation for Hamas's attack.Limited aid deliveries resumed on 21 October, but Israel halted all fuel shipments until 15 November and then allowed in only a limited amount. A US official says 140,000 litres of fuel is currently being delivered every two days.The Israeli government says the fuel could be used by Hamas, which is a proscribed terrorist organisation in Israel, the EU, UK and US.Mohammed al-Qidrah is waiting patiently in the cooking gas queue."We've been here for three days. We came here two nights ago and from 03:00 until now, we haven't been able to fill up," he says."We can't find fuel, flour or anything. You need to stand in line for everything and you struggle to find it."The World Health Organization is warning that more people will die from disease than in bombings in Gaza if the health infrastructure is not restored.Meanwhile, a UN-led aid consortium says 60% of the buildings in the territory are damaged or destroyed.As the truce holds, there are signs some life is returning to Gaza, with people trying to harvest the remainder of this year's olive crop."We have to take advantage of this opportunity, there's no time," farmer Fathy Abu Salah told the Reuters news agency at his olive grove near the southern city of Khan Younis."This war destroyed us, there's hardly any production. The majority of the harvest was wasted." A lack of electricity has also left the local olive press reliant on fuel to power its machinery."Finding fuel is a crisis that everyone is facing," says olive farmer and press worker Mohamed Wafy."As soon as we secured access to fuel, we were able to open the olive press, even if it's working at minimum capacity."

29/11/2023 03:25:00	Saudi investment fund to buy 10% stake in Heathrow airport - BBC News	Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) has agreed to buy a 10% stake in Heathrow airport from Spanish infrastructure giant Ferrovial.Another 15% in its parent company, FGP Topco, will be sold to France-based private equity fund Ardian.Ferrovial, which has owned a stake since 2006, announced that the deal was worth £2.37bn ($3bn).The transaction is still subject to regulatory conditions, according to the firm.If approved, the deal would end Ferrovial's investment in the UK airports' operator which started at 56% but was reduced to 25% by 2013.Other stakeholders in FGP Topco include Qatar Investment Authority, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, Singapore's GIC, Australian Retirement Trust, China Investment Corporation and Universities Superannuation Scheme.The airport has been losing money this year because of its significant debt which is affected by aggressive hikes in the cost of borrowing.The Civil Aviation Authority has also decided to lower passenger charges which go towards costs for terminals runways, baggage systems and security.The average charge per passenger at Heathrow for 2023 is £31.57 but the regulator said this would fall to £25.43 in 2024 and "remain broadly flat" until the end of 2026.It is understood bosses at Heathrow wanted charges to actually increase to more than £40, while airlines proposed they should be no more than around £18.50.Saudi's PIF is one of the world's most active sovereign wealth funds with more than $700bn in assets thanks to its oil wealth, which has recently been investing in sport such as football and golf.But the fund is controlled by Saudi Arabia's prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud whose government has been accused of numerous human rights violations.US intelligence has said it believes Prince Mohammed ordered the 2018 killing of a US-based journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, though the prince has been given immunity in the US and he has also been invited to visit the UK according to the Saudi Arabian embassy.	
28/11/2023 22:36:00	Boy, 14, and freelance reporter among Palestinians freed - BBC News	Thirty Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel on Tuesday night as part of the truce deal with Hamas.They include "15 minors and 15 women", a spokesman for Qatar's foreign ministry said.Among those released are Marwat al-Azza, a freelance journalist who had previously worked with US broadcaster NBC, and a 14-year-old boy.They were freed as 10 Israeli and two foreign hostages were released by Hamas in Gaza.The Israeli prison service said the prisoners had been released from Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank and the Jerusalem Detention Center.Tuesday was the fifth day of the truce between Israel and Hamas, after a 48-hour extension was agreed yesterday.Ms al-Azza, 45, was arrested earlier this month in East Jerusalem on suspicion of inciting terrorism and identifying with a terrorist organisation in relation to social media posts she made about Hamas's attack on 7 October, which killed about 1,200 Israelis.NBC cut ties with her following her arrest.Another prisoner released by Israel was named by Al Jazeera as Ahmed Salayme, 14. Last May, UK-based website Middle East Eye reported that the teenager was arrested on charges of throwing stones in East Jerusalem.In an interview upon his release, he told Al Jazeera that Israeli prison officers carried out "a number of beatings" including on female inmates, on the day the war started on 7 October.He added that he was told not to celebrate his release: "I'm not allowed to leave my house, raise any signs or banners, use a megaphone. And if I break any of these rules I will be taken back," he said.His mother told Al Jazeera Israeli authorities had searched the family home several times ahead of her son's release and said she was afraid her son could be rearrested at any moment.Reuters news agency showed images of Palestinians cheering just outside Ofer prison at the Beitunia checkpoint as the new batch of prisoners were driven past on buses marked with the the International Red Cross sign.Israel's national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir has banned Palestinians from celebrating the prisoners' release, according to Israeli media. "My instructions are clear: there are to be no expressions of joy. Expressions of joy are equivalent to backing terrorism," Mr Ben Gvir was quoted as saying.Since Friday, a total of 180 Palestinians - mostly women and teenage boys - have been released from Israeli jails as part of the truce.They were chosen from an original list of 300 Palestinians compiled by Israel and had been accused of a range of offences, from throwing stones to incitement to attempted murder. Fewer than a quarter of those on the list had been convicted - the vast majority were being held on remand while awaiting trial.Under the terms of the truce, three Palestinians are being freed in exchange for each Israeli hostage returned from Gaza. 	
28/11/2023 21:46:00	'We fought to get her back,' son says as more hostages released - BBC News	The son of 75-year-old hostage Ada Sagi has told BBC News he plans to give her the biggest hug and tell her "how hard we fought" for her release.Ada Sagi was among 10 Israelis - nine women and a girl - and two Thais released on the fifth day of the truce.We spoke to British-Israeli Noam Sagi just after his mother and the others were handed over to the Red Cross on Tuesday evening."It really is a beautiful, amazing moment," he said. Ada was released alongside: Tamar Metzger, 78; Ditza Hayman, 84; Norlin Babdila, 60; Ophelia Edith Roitman, 77; Rimon Kirsht, 36; and Merav Tal, 53.Three members of one family were also freed: Clara Marman, 63; Gabriela Leimberg, 59; and Mia Leimberg, 17."It's such a huge relief," said Noam Sagi. "I've just finished a video call with her. She's sharp, she's funny, she's witty. She's her own self. I'm over the moon."I just want to feel her and hug her and I want her to know how hard we fought to get to this day and she will know forever how loved she is."He said she "looks good, she was very happy" But he says there's a lot she doesn't know. "She doesn't know she doesn't have a home to go back to, she doesn't know so many of her friends were murdered.""We will have to pick up the puzzle and put everything in place... but for now, today, it's really just about the joy," he added.I first met Noam at his home in north London two days after his mum was taken from her home in the kibbutz of Nir Oz, near Israel's border with Gaza. He played us a video filmed by Hamas that showed gunmen on the grass outside his mum's house and her car on fire.He has since met the UK prime minister, MPs, talked at rallies and spoken to diplomats and the Red Cross to try and get his mum released.Before she was kidnapped, Ada, an Arabic speaker, had taught others Arabic so they could communicate with their Palestinian neighbours. She was, her son said, a peace activist and part of a community who "fought all their lives for good neighbouring relationships". Ada had been due to visit London for her 75th birthday the week after she was kidnapped. Speaking earlier, he told the BBC that waiting to see if she would be among those released amounted to "psychological terror". "Every night waiting like a leaf for a list.. Are we in? Are we out? It's been excruciatingly painful," he said, describing it as "Russian roulette to the heart".While some people tore down posters showing those kidnapped from walls in the UK, Noam was talking to the lampposts that had pictures of his mum on. The other hostages released on Tuesday included 84-year-old Ditza Heiman, one of the founders of kibbutz Nir Oz, which Hamas attacked on 7 October. Also kidnapped from Nir Oz was Ofelia Roitman, 77, who moved to Israel from Argentina in the 1980s.She sent a message pleading for help as Hamas attacked. Her daughter said in a video that a search of her house afterwards had found other bodies, but she was missing.Clara Merman, Gabriela Leimberg and her daughter Mia were among a group of five Argentinian-Israelis who had been hiding in their safe room, according to one of the group's daughter who was texting with her father. Noralin "Nataly" Babadilla, 60, was visiting Kibbutz Nirim, to celebrate the community's 70th anniversary. Her husband was murdered. Her younger brother, Exo, told the Bring Them Home website that her last words to him were: "I'm shaking; maybe I won't come home."Meanwhile Meirav Tal, 53, had been visiting her partner Yair in Nir Oz. The couple were kidnapped along with Yair's children Yagil and Or, who were released on Monday. Yair remains in Hamas captivity in Gaza.	
28/11/2023 16:07:00	Untreated diseases could kill more than bombings in Gaza, WHO warns - BBC News	Untreated diseases could eventually kill more people in Gaza than bombings if the health system is not restored, the World Health Organization says.Diarrhoea and respiratory infections are widespread among children in overcrowded UN facilities where almost 1.1 million people are sheltering.Patients with chronic illnesses like cancer are also receiving no treatment.The warning comes as a truce between Israel and Hamas entered a fifth day, after a 48-hour extension was agreed.The deal mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States should see an additional 20 Israeli women and children held hostage in Gaza being released in exchange for 60 Palestinian women and teenagers in Israeli prisons.On Monday, 11 hostages and 33 prisoners were freed on the fourth and final day of the initial agreement, bringing the totals to 50 hostages and 150 prisoners released. Nineteen foreign nationals, one of whom has Israeli citizenship, have also been handed over by Hamas under separate agreements.Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza and imposed a siege in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,800 people have been killed in the territory since the war began.The UN estimates that more than 1.8 million people in Gaza have fled their homes over the past seven weeks. About 60% of them are sheltering in 156 facilities belonging to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa.WHO spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris told a news conference in Geneva that an assessment of those shelters had found outbreaks of infectious diseases, with cases of diarrhoea among children aged five and older more than 100 times normal levels by early November. No treatment is available for them, she said, without which infants in particular can deteriorate and die very quickly.According to the UN, only five hospitals are partially operational in the north of Gaza, the area that has been the focus of the Israeli ground offensive. Eight of the 11 hospitals are functional in the south, where the Israeli military has ordered civilians to flee. Only one of those hospitals has the capacity to treat critical trauma cases or perform complex surgery."Eventually, we will see more people dying from disease than we are even seeing from the bombardment if we are not able to put back [together] this health system," Dr Harris warned.Addressing journalists via video link from Gaza, Unicef spokesman James Elder reported seeing hospitals full of children with horrendous war wounds.He described seeing one child missing part of his leg lying untreated on a hospital floor for several hours because of a lack of medical staff. Other injured children were lying in car parks and gardens outside, he said. Displaced children and their families are also suffering because of a lack of proper shelter and clothing to protect them from the rainy and cold weather currently in Gaza. Over the first four days of the truce, 800 aid lorries entered Gaza, with some reaching the north, according to US officials. That is an increase in comparison to the preceding few days, but it is still just a fraction of the usual number.The UN agencies say that in such conditions, a resumption in fighting should be unthinkable, they are calling again for a permanent ceasefire.Israel's prime minister has promised that its military will "go to realising our goals with full force" when the pause ends. However, Qatar's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it would use the extension to seek a "sustainable truce that would lead to further negotiations and eventually an end... to this war"."We are working with what we have. And what we have right now is the provision to the agreement that allows us to extend days as long as Hamas is able to guarantee the release of at least 10 hostages," spokesman Majed al-Ansari told reporters in Doha.He added that mediators hoped to receive information from Hamas about the more than 150 Israelis and foreign nationals still being held hostage, who include children as young as 10 months old as well as a number of soldiers.A senior Hamas source in Qatar told the BBC that not all of the civilian hostages were in its hands. Some were with smaller armed groups like Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which like Hamas is classed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other Western powers.According to the source, Hamas needs more time to collect information and contact people. Communication is very difficult because of the damage to the telecoms network and the shortage of fuel to power it.Mr Ansari also said only "minimal breaches" of the truce had been reported. But two hours after he spoke the Israeli military said three explosive devices had been detonated near its troops in two different locations in northern Gaza in violation of the agreement. "In one of the locations, terrorists also opened fire at the troops, who responded with fire. A number of soldiers were lightly injured during the incidents," it added.Hamas's military wing said there had been "friction" in the north and that its fighters had dealt with an "clear breach" of the truce deal by Israeli troops. Gunfire and explosions were earlier reported in north-western Gaza City.A local journalist told the BBC that dozens of displaced people were trying to return to their houses in the Sheikh Radwan area when they approached Israeli army positions, and that an Israeli tank and troops fired warning shots. One person was wounded and a building was hit by a shell, they said.	
28/11/2023 16:01:00	Cat Smith MP says Christian faith behind her ceasefire call - BBC News	Labour MP Cat Smith has told how her Christian faith was behind her decision to defy Sir Keir Starmer and vote for a full ceasefire in Gaza.Sir Keir suffered a major rebellion over his stance, with 56 of his MPs voting for an end to the fighting.He backed pauses in the conflict to deliver aid to the war-torn region instead.Ms Smith, who represents Lancaster and Fleetwood, said she feels "called upon to be a peacemaker" as a Christian.She added: "I couldn't in all good conscience not vote for a ceasefire. My route to politics has been through my faith."I want to see peace across the world. I want to see peace in the Middle East."I believe that can only be brought about when the violence and fighting and war stops and when dialogue and political conversations and peace building happens."For me, a ceasefire has to be the first step."The temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has entered its fifth day after a 48-hour extension was agreed, with various hostages and prisoners freed.Sir Keir said he wanted Labour to be "as united as we can" after a series of frontbench resignations over the issue.The Labour Party has been contacted by the BBC for comment.Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

28/11/2023 14:14:00	Toxic gas putting millions at risk in Middle East, BBC finds - BBC News	Toxic pollutants released during gas flaring are endangering millions more people than previously feared, a BBC investigation suggests.Flaring - the burning of waste gas during oil drilling - is taking place across the Gulf, including by COP28 hosts the United Arab Emirates.New research suggests pollution is spreading hundreds of miles, worsening air quality across the entire region. It comes as the UAE hosts the UN's COP28 climate summit on Thursday.The UAE banned routine flaring 20 years ago, but satellite images show it is continuing, despite the potential health consequences for its inhabitants and those in neighbouring countries. Analysis for BBC Arabic shows gasses are now spreading hundreds of kilometres across the region.Pollution from wells in Iraq, Iran and Kuwait were also analysed as part of the study. All of the countries involved either declined to comment or did not respond. Oil companies, including BP and Shell, who are responsible or partly responsible for sites where flaring took place said they were working to reduce the practice.On Monday, BBC News revealed leaked documents showed how the UAE had planned to use its role as the host of UN climate talks as an opportunity to strike oil and gas deals. David R. Boyd, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment said the BBC's findings were: "Very disturbing. Big oil companies and states in the Middle East are violating the human rights of millions of people by failing to tackle air pollution from fossil fuels. "Despite the massive human suffering, Big Oil and petrostates carry on with business as usual with total impunity and zero accountability."BreathlessHow the hidden toxic air pollution of the oil giants is spreading hundreds of kilometres, putting the health of millions of people at risk in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Iran and Iraq.The documentary is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) and is also being broadcast on BBC World News at 09:30 GMT on Saturday 9 December.Flaring is avoidable and the gas can be captured and used to generate electricity or heat homes - yet it continues to take place across the world.Pollutants from flaring include PM2.5, Ozone, NO2, and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) which at high levels or continued exposure have been linked to strokes, cancer, asthma and heart disease according to international experts including the World Health Organisation (WHO).   Global flaring is also a major source of the planet-warming greenhouse gases CO2 and methane.Two decades ago, the UAE national oil company, Adnoc - run by the president of this year's COP28 climate summit, Sultan al-Jaber -  committed to ending "routine flaring". Yet assessment of satellite images by the BBC shows it is taking place on a daily basis at offshore sites. The UAE is one of the biggest sources of oil for the UK market.Reliably measuring air pollution from the flares on the ground is challenging and there is little official data.Each time gas is flared it is known to release a certain amount of pollution. Working with BBC Arabic, environmental scientists  combined this information with the volumes of gas flared - which the World Bank publishes - to work out total pollution.  A simulation based on current weather conditions then estimated how gases moved across the region.  The model suggested, for example, that three offshore fields in the UAE were adding to air pollution in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, hundreds of kilometres away.  Studies have shown that children exposed to elevated levels of PM2.5 are more likely to develop asthma and persistent wheezing than those who are not exposed. Respiratory disease is one of the leading causes of death in the region, with the rates of asthma in UAE amongst the highest in the world.  The BBC analysis indicates that in the case of Kuwait, some of this man-made pollution is coming from flares 140km away in Iraq. Iraq has the second highest volume of flaring in the world, according to World Bank data, after Russia - burning nearly 18 billion cubic metres of gas a year. This could power nearly 20 million European homes annually. The biggest single source of flaring in the world is from a giant Iraqi oil field called Rumaila, managed by BP and Petrochina. It is in southern Iraq, just over 30km (20 miles) from the border with Kuwait.The BBC research suggests one cancer-causing pollutant called benzoapyrene was ten times higher in northern Kuwait than European safety standards. In villages close to the flares in Iraq itself, levels of PM2.5 were also extremely high, reaching hourly peaks of 100 micrograms per cubic metre.  The WHO's recommended safe limit is 5 micrograms per cubic metre. Even 100km away in Kuwait City, levels still reached 5 to 10 micrograms per cubic metre. Dirty air in parts of the Gulf is often blamed on the region's regular dust storms, but Dr Barrak Alahmad, research fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, found that wasn't necessarily the case.  He and his team spent two years analysing Kuwait's air and dust to find out where the pollution was coming from. "Actually, what we found out is that only 40% comes from the desert."Forty-two percent comes from sources that involve power plants, and involve the oil industry, and involves all the industry that is in Kuwait and outside of Kuwait." According to his team's study the remaining pollution comes from high levels of traffic in the country. "This is man-made air pollution that we can regulate, we can reduce, we can in fact eliminate," he told the BBC. Dr Alahmad said PM2.5 particles get into the bloodstream of those who breathe it in and can then quickly get into their organs.  "Your kidneys, your brain, your heart, everywhere. This can lead to an acute asthmatic attack. At some point, it could be very life threatening," he said. Abdulrahman Alameeri, a 39 year-old engineer, lives with his family in Kuwait City and his two sons struggle with asthma. Particularly his six year-old Jassem, who has been hospitalised on multiple occasions. He told the BBC: "The first time [Jassem] had an asthma attack, he was unable to breathe. He turned blue." Dr Akshaya Bhagavathula, associate professor of epidemiology at North Dakota State University, who was not involved in the BBC study, reviewed the results of our research. "This preliminary modelling study highlights potentially substantial impacts of flaring on air quality in the Gulf region, but additional measurements and analysis are needed to comprehensively quantify health burdens." The oil fields in Iraq and Kuwait have complex ownership structures, allowing international oil companies like Eni, Lukoil and BP who work here to not declare all emissions from their activities.  BP is a major player in the region. It is a leading contractor working at Rumaila oil field and for Kuwait Oil Company which is responsible for 82% of flaring in the country. BP reported that it made £53m in profit last year from its operations in Kuwait.  In response BP told the BBC: "As we have stated before, BP is not and has never been the operator of the Rumaila field. Nevertheless, we continue to actively support the lead contractor in its work to help the operator of the field to reduce its flaring and emissions." Rumaila is operated by Rumaila Operating Organisation which is a consortium of organisations including Basra Energy Company - a partnership between BP and PetroChina. Instead of burning the gas, it could be captured and used to power people's homes, according to the World Bank. The initial cost of installing the technology to do so is high - the World Bank estimates globally it would cost $100bn. But if captured and sold the gas could fetch $16bn annually.  In 2013, the Iraqi government and oil and gas giant Shell set up the Basrah Gas Company to capture gas at the three biggest fields, Rumaila, Qurna and Zubair. But since then, overall levels of flaring have remained steady - and actually increased at two of the fields, according to World Bank data. Shell told the BBC: "Basrah Gas Company's sole purpose is to capture gas that would otherwise be flared from three giant oilfields, which are operated by other companies. It captures more than 63% of the gas from those fields, but does not have the capacity to capture all of it." Lukoil told the BBC it operates "in accordance with Iraqi law". And ENI said it "collaborates to reduce and minimize gas flaring". PetroChina told the BBC that they are working with BP to support the rehabilitation of Rumaila. And expressed that they are extremely concerned by the issues raised by the BBC.Although the UAE did not respond, its national oil company, Adnoc said: "Across all our operations, we are focussed on our goal of eliminating routine flaring by 2030. We flare at a lower rate than the global industry average."The contribution of flaring to the regional burden of air pollution is estimated through regional chemical-transport model (CTM) simulations. The air quality over the region has been reconstructed with and without the flare's emissions. The use of CTM simulations allows for an estimation of how the pollutants emitted from the flares are dispersed, and their interaction with background atmospheric composition, the production of secondary pollutants and their contribution to local air quality. The pollutant emissions from the flares were estimated from the flared gas volumes reported by the World Bank Gas Flaring Tracker and emission factors available in peer-reviewed publications and reference emission inventories guidebooks. The simulation was limited to two monthly periods. A full year would be desirable to thoroughly describe the impact of weather variability on the atmospheric composition and air quality, but we believe that the simulation of two full months is an acceptable option to obtain a first reliable estimate of the flare's impact under different seasonal conditions. The atmospheric composition over the area has then been reconstructed using a three-dimensional modelling system obtained by the coupling of WRF meteorological model, and FARM CTM.

28/11/2023 14:14:00	'Granny, I've been shot,' said Palestinian student targeted in Vermont - BBC News	After being ambushed and shot in the spine on a US street at the weekend, Hisham Awartani called police. Then the Palestinian-American student phoned his British-born grandmother. "Granny, I've been shot," the 20-year-old said, his uncle told the BBC.Mr Awartani was targeted on Saturday in Burlington, Vermont, along with two fellow Palestinian-American students.He and the other victims - Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Aliahmad - are expected to survive.All three are recovering from their injuries in an intensive care unit at hospital.But for Mr Awartani, who was most critically injured, family members fear he may not walk again. His road to recovery will be long either way, his uncle said."The bullet is lodged in his T2 vertebra against his spine," Rich Price said. The uncle said the incident had left him and other relatives of the victims with a sense of shame, as family members had encouraged the young men to pursue university education in the US for stability and safety."Never could we have imagined that they would come here to study and something like this could happen to them," Mr Price said. Mr Awartani is in his third year of studies at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.He and his friends were attacked after attending the birthday party of Mr Price's twin eight-year-old sons at a local bowling alley. The three 20-year-olds are childhood best friends who attended the Ramallah Friends School, a Quaker-run private non-profit in the West Bank. They were in Burlington visiting relatives for US Thanksgiving, and were staying with Mr Awartani's grandmother, Marian Price, who is originally from Surbiton, Surrey. They were gunned down round the corner from her home."Within five minutes of leaving the house, a man stepped out of the darkness, pulled a gun on them and shot four times," said Mr Price.Two of them were shot in the chest, he said, and a third was shot in the lower part of his body. Mr Awartani was also shot in the hand, his uncle said. Police have arrested a suspect, 48-year-old Jason Eaton, who lives near Mr Awartani's relatives, in a neighbourhood close to the University of Vermont. When he opened his front door to find federal agents who were searching for him, he told them he had been expecting them, officials saidMr Eaton appeared in court on Monday and pleaded not guilty to three counts of second-degree attempted murder. He is being held without bail. Police have not identified a possible motive, but are investigating whether a hate crime was committed.Relatives believe the young men were deliberately targeted because of their Palestinian background. They were speaking a mix of English and Arabic at the time they were shot, and two were wearing keffiyehs, traditional Palestinian scarves. The incident comes as the US deals with a surge in Islamophobia and antisemitism since the start of the Israel-Gaza war.Mr Price said the attack is especially heart-breaking given the sense of safety the family previously felt in Burlington, a city of around 45,000 people."To have something like this happen," Mr Price said, "which in our view is most likely driven by hate, it is devastating for us."The uncle said that despite his nephew's serious injury, he had shown strength and even a sense of humour while recovering in intensive care. "I do know that he is incredibly grateful that so many people are thinking about him," he added.Mr Price said his family had been heartened by the support the three young men have received, not just from the US but across the globe. At a vigil held in his honour on Monday night at Brown University's campus, a professor read out a statement from Mr Awartani describing himself as "one casualty in a much wider conflict", NBC News reported.But the vigil was disrupted by hundreds of pro-Palestinian students who chanted "shame on you" at the university president and demanded the school divest its endowment from companies profiting from the war.US President Joe Biden has denounced the attack."While we are waiting for more facts, we know this: there is absolutely no place for violence or hate in America. Period," Mr Biden said in a statement. 	
28/11/2023 09:34:00	Israel Gaza: 33 Palestinians released on fourth day of truce - BBC News	More Palestinians have been freed from Israeli prisons on the fourth day of a truce between Israel and Hamas.The release of 33 people means 150 Palestinians have been released since Friday - the day both sides began swapping hostages and prisoners.Fifty-one Israeli hostages, including three-year-old-twin sisters, have been freed by Hamas as part of the deal. Qatar has said the pause in fighting will be extended by two days, which Israel has not confirmed or denied.Little information has been released about the latest group of Palestinians to be freed.On Monday both Hamas and Qatar - which has played a major role in the talks between the warring sides - said 30 Palestinian children and three women were due to be freed.The Israel Prison Service later said 33 people had been freed from Ofer prison in the West Bank, and a detention centre in Jerusalem, but did not specify their genders or ages. By the evening, Reuters news agency reported that a bus carrying the newly released Palestinian prisoners had arrived in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.Images showed people in the Palestinian city, waiting to greet them - some carrying green flags of Hamas, their faces covered with balaclavas. Separate images showed a Palestinian boy named Muhammad Abu Al-Humus reuniting with his mother, and other family members, at the family's home in East Jerusalem. Al-Humus called his release "an indescribable joy" and kissed his mother's hand, the AFP news agency reports.It was not immediately clear which facility he had been detained in, or for how long. Eitaf Jaradat, one of the three Palestinian women released in the latest exchange, said "the price of our freedom is seemingly expensive" as she was welcomed back by her family."We always hope that we are freed and that our people are in a good situation. But this is our destiny that we were freed while they are on a sea of blood," she told Reuters.Ms Jaradat was arrested in 2021, accused of involvement in a shooting that caused the death of an Israeli settler, according to Reuters.While fighting between Hamas and Israel is temporarily suspended, aid organisations have taken the opportunity to send lorries into Gaza filled with essentials such as food, water, fuel and medicines.Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children, should a two-day extension of the truce go ahead. Israel has not commented explicitly on the extension, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Monday evening that it had "approved the inclusion of 50 female prisoners in the list of prisoners eligible to be released, in the event that a release of additional Israeli hostages is carried out".	
28/11/2023 03:46:00	Israel Gaza: Three-year-old-twins among hostages released by Hamas - BBC News	A mother and her three-year-old twin daughters, who were kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October, are among 11 Israeli hostages released on Monday.Sharon Aloni Cunio, and her children Ema and Yuly, were taken from kibbutz Nir Oz with some other family members.Their release came on the fourth day of a truce between Israel and Hamas, with Israeli hostages being swapped for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.Another mother and seven children make up the latest batch of freed hostages.Sharon Aloni Cunio's husband, David Cunio, was also taken hostage by Hamas last month. He and his brother Ariel are still believed to be in Gaza, held captive. Her sister Danielle Aloni and five-year-old niece, Emilia, were released by Hamas last week. They were all kidnapped from the same kibbutz - Nir Oz, in southern Israel - after taking shelter in a safe room. Hamas had then set fire to the house, and the family were captured as they tried to escape the flames.Also freed on Monday were teenage brothers Or Yaakov, 16, and Yagil who turned 13 while being held by Hamas.They were kidnapped on 7 October along with their father Yair Yaakov and his partner Meirav Tal, both of who are still thought to be in captivity. The children's mother, Ranana, was on the phone with them when Hamas arrived, and heard her youngest son cry: "Don't take me, I'm too young!"Siblings Sahar Kalderon, 16, and her 12-year-old brother Erez were freed by Hamas, too. Their father Ofer, 53, has not been released. Also released were Karina Engel-Bart, 52, and her daughters, Mika, 18 and Yuval, 11. Ms Engel-Bart's husband, 55-year-old Ronen Engel, remains in Gaza. Speaking to local media in Israel, her brother Diego Engel-Bert, said the family had been "glued to the TV screen and full of happiness and longing" after finding out their relatives were to be released. Eitan Yahalomi, 12, was the final Israeli hostage to be released on Monday. His mother, Batshema Yahalomi, told the BBC earlier this month that Eitan and her husband, Ohad, had been taken by Hamas fighters on the back of motorbikes. Qatar, a chief negotiator in the talks between Israel and Hamas, said on Monday that both sides had agreed to extend the temporary truce by two days. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied this.Under the extension, Hamas has committed to release another 20 women and children, according to US national security spokesman John Kirby.He estimated that up to nine of the remaining hostages were American, and said he hoped they would be among those released in the coming days.	
27/11/2023 21:35:00	Elon Musk visits Israel after antisemitism row - BBC News	Israel's president has told Elon Musk he has "an important role" in preventing antisemitism, which both he and his social media platform X have been accused of promoting.Addressing the entrepreneur, Isaac Herzog said social media "including some you lead - harbor so much of the age-old disease of antisemitism".On Monday Mr Musk visited a kibbutz Hamas targeted in its deadly attack.He toured the Kfar Aza with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Mr Musk was shown footage of the 7 October attacks on Israel by Hamas, in which 1,200 people died and 240 were taken hostage, including brutal footage from bodycams. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 14,500 people have been killed in Israel's retaliatory campaign.The pair also held a brief live-streamed conversation on X, during which Mr Musk agreed with Mr Netanyahu that the only way to obtain peace and security was to destroy Hamas."You first have to get rid of the poisonous regime as you did in Germany, as you did in Japan. Yeah, in World War Two," Mr Netanyahu said.Mr Musk replied: "There's no choice. There's no choice."The trip also saw an agreement reached over Mr Musk's satellite internet service, Starlink.After Gaza experienced major internet disruption and outages as Israel intensified its military operations, Mr Musk had suggested giving Starlink to major aid organisations in the territory. But Israel argued the tech would be used by Hamas.Now an agreement has been reached that Starlink can only be used in Israel and Gaza with approval of the Israeli government. Israel's Communication Minister Shlomo Karhi said this understanding was "vital".Mr Musk's visit comes after Apple, Disney, IBM and Comcast paused adverts on X in the wake of an investigation by a US group, Media Matters for America, which flagged ads appearing next to pro-Nazi posts.Advertising is a critical source of income for X, which has fiercely challenged the report, questioning its research methods. It has launched what Elon Musk billed as a "thermonuclear lawsuit" against the organisation.In response, Media Matters called Mr Musk a bully. Mr Musk has also been criticised for promoting an antisemitic trope when he replied to a post on X that shared a conspiracy theory which falsely accused Jewish communities of pushing hatred against white people, calling it "actual truth".It appeared to be an endorsement of a racist and antisemitic conspiracy theory known as "white genocide," which argues that Jewish people systematically plot to encourage immigration of "non-white" people to Western countries in order to "eliminate" the white race.It prompted a significant backlash, with the White House among those denouncing Mr Musk's endorsement of the post.Mr Musk has denied his post was antisemitic and has said his comments referred not to all Jewish people but to groups like the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), who have been critical of the platform, and other unspecified groups.	
27/11/2023 21:15:00	Israel-Hamas truce in Gaza extended for two days, Qatar says - BBC News	Israel and Hamas have agreed to extend the four-day truce in Gaza for another two days, mediator Qatar says.Hamas said the extension was "under the same conditions", which were for 50 Israeli hostages to be released in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners.Israel has yet to comment, but it had offered a day's pause in the fighting for every 10 Israeli hostages freed.It came as 11 hostages were released in the final exchange under the original deal that took effect on Friday.Israeli officials said three-year-old twins and their mother were among them, along with six more children, an 18-year-old and her mother. The Israeli military said they had crossed into Israeli territory. However all of the released children's fathers remained in Gaza.Those freed included people who also held French, German and Argentine nationality, Qatar said.Thirty-three Palestinian women and teenagers in Israeli jails were due to be released under the truce deal.Hamas - which is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other Western powers - has freed 39 Israelis over the previous three days. In exchange, Israel has freed 117 Palestinian prisoners.Nineteen foreign nationals, one of whom has Israeli citizenship, have also been handed over by Hamas under separate agreements.The pause in the fighting is also allowing a big increase in deliveries of aid to Gaza, where there is a deepening humanitarian crisis.Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza and imposed a siege in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,800 people have been killed in the territory since the war began.Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari announced on Monday afternoon on X, formerly known as Twitter, that "as part of the ongoing mediation, an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian pause for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip".White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US welcomed the extension."This humanitarian pause has already brought a halt to the fighting together with a surge of humanitarian assistance. Now, in order to extend the pause Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children over the next two days," he said."We would of course hope to see the pause extended further and that will depend upon Hamas continuing to release hostages."Before the start of Monday's exchange, an Israeli official said that 184 people remained in captivity in Gaza, including 14 foreign nationals and 80 Israelis with dual citizenship.On Sunday, a Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas was prepared to release up to 40 additional hostages, which would mean a four-day extension under the terms offered by Israel.Israel was reported to be leaning towards a more gradual, day-by-day approach. And it has made it clear that it is preparing to resume the war in Gaza at the end of the process."At the end of the outline, we will go to realising our goals with full force: eliminating Hamas, ensuring that Gaza will not go back to being what it was and, of course, releasing all of our hostages," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement on Sunday evening.Earlier, Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the agreement would be extended if Hamas was "able to prove, to locate, and secure some of the hostages that are within the criteria of the first group, which is women and children".But he warned that Hamas's "very complicated structure" presented a challenge for Qatari mediators, with the group's political leaders in Doha having to relay information to and from military commanders in Gaza.	
27/11/2023 17:05:00	How Hamas built a force to attack Israel on 7 October - BBC News	Five armed Palestinian groups joined Hamas in the deadly 7 October attack on Israel after training together in military-style exercises from 2020 onwards, BBC News analysis shows.The groups carried out joint drills in Gaza which closely resembled the tactics used during the deadly assault - including at a site less than 1km (0.6 miles) from the barrier with Israel - and posted them on social media. They practised hostage-taking, raiding compounds and breaching Israel's defences during these exercises, the last of which was held just 25 days before the attack.BBC Arabic and BBC Verify have collated evidence which shows how Hamas brought together Gaza's factions to hone their combat methods - and ultimately execute a raid into Israel which has plunged the region into war. On 29 December 2020, Hamas's overall leader Ismail Haniyeh declared the first of four drills codenamed Strong Pillar a "strong message and a sign of unity" between Gaza's various armed factions.As the most powerful of Gaza's armed groups, Hamas was the dominant force in a coalition which brought together 10 other Palestinian factions in a war games-style exercise overseen by a "joint operation room".The structure was set up in 2018 to coordinate Gaza's armed factions under a central command. Prior to 2018, Hamas had formally coordinated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Gaza's second largest armed faction and - like Hamas - a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries.Hamas had also fought alongside other groups in previous conflicts, but the 2020 drill was billed in propaganda as evidence a wider array of groups were being unified.Hamas's leader said the first drill reflected the "permanent readiness" of the armed factions.The 2020 exercise was the first of four joint drills held over three years, each of which was documented in polished videos posted on public social media channels. The BBC has visually identified 10 groups, including PIJ, by their distinctive headbands and emblems training alongside Hamas during the Strong Pillar drills in footage posted on the messaging app Telegram.Following the 7 October attack, five of the groups went on to post videos claiming to show them taking part in the assault. Three others issued written statements on Telegram claiming to have participated. The role of these groups has come into sharp focus as pressure builds on Hamas to find dozens of women and children believed to have been taken as captives from Israel into Gaza by other factions on 7 October.Three groups - PIJ, the Mujahideen Brigades and Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades - claim to have seized Israeli hostages, alongside Hamas, on that day. Efforts to extend the temporary truce in Gaza were said to be hinging on Hamas locating those hostages.While these groups are drawn from a broad ideological spectrum ranging from hard-line Islamist to relatively secular, all shared a willingness to use violence against Israel.Hamas statements repeatedly stressed the theme of unity between Gaza's disparate armed groups. The group suggested they were equal partners in the joint drills, whilst it continued to play a leading role in the plans to attack Israel.Footage from the first drill shows masked commanders in a bunker appearing to conduct the exercise, and begins with a volley of rocket fire.It cuts to heavily armed fighters overrunning a mocked-up tank marked with an Israeli flag, detaining a crew member and dragging him away as a prisoner, as well as raiding buildings. We know from videos and harrowing witness statements that both tactics were used to capture soldiers and target civilians on 7 October, when around 1,200 people were killed and an estimated 240 hostages were taken.The second Strong Pillar drill was held almost exactly one year later.Ayman Nofal, a commander in the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - the official name for Hamas's armed wing - said the aim of the exercise on 26 December 2021 was to "affirm the unity of the resistance factions".He said the drills would "tell the enemy that the walls and engineering measures on the borders of Gaza will not protect them".Another Hamas statement said the "joint military manoeuvres" were designed to "simulate the liberation of settlements near Gaza" - which is how the group refers to Israeli communities.The exercise was repeated on 28 December 2022, and propaganda images of fighters practising clearing buildings and overrunning tanks in what appears to be a replica of a military base were published to mark the event.The exercises were reported on in Israel, so it's inconceivable they were not being closely monitored by the country's extensive intelligence agencies.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have previously carried out air strikes to disrupt Hamas's training activities. In April 2023, they bombed the site used for the first Strong Pillar drill. Weeks before the attacks, female surveillance soldiers near the Gaza border reportedly warned of unusually high drone activity and that Hamas was training to take over observation posts with replicas of their positions.But, according to reports in the Israeli media, they say they were ignored.Brigadier General Amir Avivi, a former IDF deputy commander in Gaza, told the BBC:  "There was a lot of intelligence that they were doing this training - after all, the videos are public, and this was happening just hundreds of metres from the fence (with Israel)."But he said while the military knew about the drills, they "didn't see what they were training for".The IDF said they "eliminated" Nofal on 17 October 2023, the first senior Hamas military leader to be killed during the conflict. Hamas went to great lengths to make sure the drills were realistic.In 2022, fighters practised storming a mock Israeli military base built just 2.6km (1.6 miles) from the Erez crossing, a route between Gaza and Israel controlled by the IDF.BBC Verify has pinpointed the site in the far north of Gaza, just 800m (0.5 miles) from the barrier, by matching geographic features seen in the training footage to aerial images of the area. As of November 2023, the site was still visible on Bing Maps.The training camp was within 1.6km (1 mile) of an Israeli observation tower and an elevated observation box, elements in a security barrier Israel has spent hundreds of millions of dollars constructing.The mock base is on land dug several metres below ground level, so it may not have been immediately visible to any nearby Israeli patrols - but the smoke rising from the explosions surely would have been, and the IDF is known to use aerial surveillance. Hamas used this site to practise storming buildings, taking hostages at gunpoint and destroying security barriers.BBC Verify has used publicly available information - including satellite imagery - to locate 14 training sites at nine different locations across Gaza.They even trained twice at a site less than 1.6 km (1 mile) from the United Nations' aid agency distribution centre, and which was visible in the background of an official video published by the agency in December 2022.On 10 September 2023, the so-called joint committee room published images on its dedicated Telegram channel of men in military uniforms carrying out surveillance of military installations along the Gaza barrier.Two days later, the fourth Strong Pillar military exercise was staged, and by 7 October, all the tactics that would be deployed in the unprecedented attack had been rehearsed.Fighters were filmed riding in the same type of white Toyota pickup trucks which were seen roaming through southern Israel the following month.The propaganda video shows gunmen raiding mock buildings and firing at dummy targets inside, as well as training to storm a beach using a boat and underwater divers. Israel has said it repelled attempted Hamas boat landings on its shores on 7 October.However, Hamas did not publicise its training with motorcycles and paragliders as part of the Strong Pillar propaganda. A training video posted by Hamas three days after 7 October shows fences and barriers being demolished to allow motorcycles to pass through, a tactic they used to reach communities in southern Israel. We have not identified similar earlier videos.Footage of fighters using paragliding equipment was also not published until the 7 October attack was under way.  In a training video shared on the day of the attack, gunmen are seen landing in a mock kibbutz at an airstrip we have located to a site north of Rafah in southern Gaza.BBC Verify established it was recorded some time before 25 August 2022, and was stored in a computer file titled Eagle Squadron, the name Hamas uses for its aerial division - suggesting the paragliders plan was in the works for over a year. Before 7 October, Hamas was thought to have about 30,000 fighters in the Gaza Strip, according to reports quoting IDF commanders. It was also thought that Hamas could draw on several thousands of fighters from smaller groups.Hamas is by far the most powerful of the Palestinian armed groups, even without the support of other factions - suggesting its interest in galvanising the factions was driven by an attempt to secure broad support within Gaza at least as much as bolstering its own numbers.The IDF has previously estimated 1,500 fighters joined the 7 October raids. The  Times of Israel reported earlier this month the IDF now believes the number was closer to 3,000.Whatever the true number, it means only a relatively small fraction of the total number of armed operatives in Gaza took part. It is not possible to verify precise numbers for how many fighters from smaller groups took part in the attack or the Strong Pillar drills.While Hamas was building cross-faction support in the build-up to the attack, Hisham Jaber, a former Brigadier General in the Lebanese army who is now a security analyst at the Middle East Centre for Studies and Research, said he believed only Hamas was aware of the ultimate plan, and it was "probable [they] asked other factions to join on the day".Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer in security studies at Kings College London, told the BBC: "While there was centralised planning, execution was de-centralised, with each squad operationalising the plan as they saw fit."He said people inside Hamas were said to be surprised by the weakness of Israel's defences, and assessed militants had likely bypassed Israel's surveillance technology by communicating offline. Hugh Lovatt, a Middle East analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Israel would have been aware of the joint training drills but "reached the wrong conclusion", assessing they amounted to the "standard" activity of paramilitary groups in the Palestinian territories, rather than being "indicative of a looming large-scale attack".Asked about the issues raised in this article, the Israel Defense Forces said it was "currently focused on eliminating the threat from the terrorist organisation Hamas" and questions about any potential failures "will be looked into in a later stage".It could be several years until Israel formally reckons with whether it missed opportunities to prevent the 7 October massacre.The ramifications for its military, intelligence services and government could be seismic.

27/11/2023 16:02:00	COP27: What was agreed at the Sharm el Sheikh climate conference? - BBC News	A new global climate pact - the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan - was agreed at the COP27 summit in November 2022.It included a historic commitment by richer nations to give money to developing nations to help them recover from the damage and economic losses wreaked from ongoing climate change impacts.It followed a year of devastating climate change-related disasters, from severe floods in Pakistan to ongoing drought in East Africa.But there was also disappointment expressed by some world leaders that there was no agreement to reduce fossil fuel usage.The plan - although not legally binding - has provided new ambitions for the world's nations on climate change.New moneyFor the first time countries agreed to establish a "loss and damage" fund. This will be a pot of money to help poorer nations recover from the impacts of climate change, such as destroyed homes, flooded land or lost income from dried-out crops.Previously, these countries have only received money for mitigation - efforts to move away from fossil fuels, and adaptation. This is money to prepare for the future impacts of climate change.The issue of loss and damage has been highly controversial. Richer nations have previously not wanted to agree to a new fund as they thought it would make them liable to cover all economic losses from climate change.In October - after five rounds of negotiations - countries agreed the fund would be run by the World Bank, but the total value of the fund and the amount developed countries would contribute was not finalised. It is hoped that these details will be agreed in December at COP28. Fossil fuelsTwo years ago at COP26, in Glasgow, countries agreed to "phase down" coal. The next step was for countries to agree to commitments on reducing the use of oil and gas - but this did not materialise at COP27. Instead countries committed to "enhancing a clean energy mix, including low-emission and renewable energy".But the phrase "low-emission energy" has raised concerns.It has not been formally defined, and there is worry that it could open the door to more gas development - as burning gas produces less emissions than other fossil fuels like coal.The UK's independent climate change body, the UKCCC, concluded there had been "limited progress on ambition to reduce emissions".The president for this years' COP - Sultan al-Jaber of the UAE - has said the phase down of fossil fuels is "inevitable" and that this years' summit will accelerate expansion of renewables and carbon capture to achieve this. A flurry of other announcements was made.Nature and foodFor the first time the main agreement had specific sections on forests and "nature-based solutions".These are actions that protect or enhance the environment that also have climate benefits, for example restoring mangroves.By including these new sections, leaders agreed that climate change, and efforts to protect plants and animals, should be complementary and not contradictory.Just weeks after COP27 governments met again in Montreal to agree a "global goal for nature".The text also mentioned food for the first time, and recognised how food shortages could continue to be driven by climate change.New research from the universities of Bournemouth, Exeter and Sheffield, published last year, estimated that 42% of recent food price inflation has been due to climate change. In Egypt countries committed to a four-year programme to discuss solutions to ongoing food issues.Buying less stuffCurrently countries calculate their total emissions and set targets based on what they produce within their borders, such as from producing electricity, or burning fuels.This means they don't count the emissions from the goods and services produced by another country for them. This is despite the fact that developed nations import large amounts of manufactured products. If these "consumption-based" emissions were counted then the UK's carbon footprint would more than double.For the first time in a global climate agreement countries recognised "the importance of transition[ing] to sustainable patterns of consumption".It is not yet clear how governments will translate this into local plans or actions.Trading carbonIn 2021 at COP6 in Glasgow countries agreed to establish a global market for trading carbon.Simply put, this means that countries or companies that produce fewer emissions than their targets could "sell" the carbon as a credit to another country or company that has produced too many emissions.Although the basic rules for this market had been agreed before Egypt there were still a lot of unresolved issues.The main one was what could be counted as a carbon credit. For example if a country planted lots of trees which absorb carbon dioxide could they sell this?A smaller group of countries has been working on the issue for the past year and presented their recommendations in Sharm el-Sheikh. But many observers and government's weren't happy.Teresa Anderson, Climate Justice Lead at Action Aid International, told the BBC there was concern that indigenous groups' rights wouldn't be protected: "You can make a really tenuous claim about your product - that it will remove carbon in some way from the atmosphere, but that could be in the form of tree plantations taking land from communities."She added that "one of the looniest proposals on the table is that you can actually cut down forests to turn into furniture" - with companies claiming they store carbon.A decision on this issue has now been delayed till COP28 this year. The focus of COP27 in Egypt was all about implementation - rather than new targets. Eight years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming "well below" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.Ahead of the conference last year 200 countries were asked to submit new plans to cut emissions by 2030, to prevent temperatures rising by more than 1.5C.With these new plans, global temperatures are still expected to rise to 2.4C. So the Egyptian COP President Sameh Shoukry wanted to focus on turning some of the more ambitious targets and pledges into tangible action.Some countries will put the commitments they make at COPs into domestic law, but most will have to be self-policed.This means it is difficult to hold countries to account for their promises. Back in 2009 richer nations promised developing countries they would give them $100bn (£88bn) a year by 2020 to help with climate change, that goal was missed and there has been no action.This year's COP28 summit is in UAE.Top image from Getty Images.

27/11/2023 16:02:00	Israel-Gaza war: The Red Cross's delicate role in hostage crises - BBC News	With intense focus on the hostages released by Hamas, a quiet but crucial part has been played by an organisation at the centre of their handover, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).Footage of the releases shows Red Cross staff, in their distinctive white vests emblazoned with its internationally recognised emblem, taking the hostages from masked gunmen, carefully helping them into their vehicles, giving them first aid and even playing with children in their first moments of freedom.The organisation was in contact with Hamas ever since it seized about 240 people during its massive attack on Israel on 7 October and took them back to Gaza. It has repeatedly called for their release, or at least to allow the ICRC to visit them.So far, 58 hostages - 40 Israeli and 12 Thais - have been released to the ICRC. The organisation was not involved in the negotiations around the terms for a release, but was standing by to facilitate the release once those terms had been agreed.From Israel, there has been some criticism that the ICRC has not done more. But the organisation said "the ICRC cannot force its way in to where hostages are held, nor do we know their location".The statement reflects frustration in Geneva that not everyone understands what the Red Cross can and cannot do. It is trying to fulfil its traditional role under the Geneva Conventions, asking to visit the hostages, deliver medical supplies, and bring news to desperate families. None of that can happen unless both Hamas and Israel agree. The ICRC is unarmed, and relies entirely on the trust of the warring parties - and civilians caught up in conflict - to carry out its work.And in the same way as it has transported hostages out of Gaza, it has also taken to their West Bank homes Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange. The logistics are a complicated but the ICRC is no stranger to such complexities. Last year it facilitated the release of almost 900 prisoners in Yemen held by Houthi rebels and Saudi-backed government troops. The operation took two days; the ICRC visited each prisoner to ensure they were well enough to travel and actually wanted to return home and then chartered planes to fly into conflict zones to pick them up.At the time Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC's regional director for the Middle East, admitted how relieved he had been that the exchange went quite smoothly. Often, he said, the life of an aid worker is "about frustration… it's about saying more often 'no' than 'yes'".The preparations the ICRC has been making for the Gaza hostages are part of a long history. In the Red Cross museum in Geneva, there is an archive of six million registration cards, with details of the prisoners and the missing from two world wars. It's a fascinating collection: one card confirms that Charles de Gaulle, France's World War Two leader and later its president, had been taken prisoner at the battle of Verdun in 1916. Others show the anxiety of mothers looking for their sons, and the sad replies confirming they had been killed.The collection illustrates the ICRC's key role under the Geneva Conventions: tracing the dead and missing, visiting prisoners of war, checking on their welfare, and exchanging messages between POWs and their families. In a quiet building in the hills above Geneva, the Red Cross tracing agency is now doing exactly the same for Russian and Ukrainian families as the war resulting from Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022 continues.But in the century between World War One and today, the ICRC's work has expanded. Warfare has changed. Traditional armies are often replaced by armed militias, and civilians as well as fighters are detained, abducted or simply go missing. The Red Cross aim remains the same: to bring news of missing loved ones, and - if possible - to reunite families separated by war.During Nelson Mandela's long imprisonment in apartheid South Africa, the ICRC visited him regularly on Robben Island. Until the Good Friday agreement for peace and power sharing in Northern Ireland, the ICRC visited members of paramilitary groups who had been imprisoned there.The Red Cross also helps with prisoner exchanges, and the release of those abducted or taken hostage. When hundreds of schoolgirls were abducted by Boko Haram in Nigeria in 2014, the ICRC helped facilitate the release of some of them two years later. But, as with the hostages in Gaza now, supporting, or facilitating, did not mean negotiating. "We were not involved in the negotiation for their release… we transferred the girls with the agreement of both parties involved," the ICRC said at the time.Mr Carboni, who accompanied his boss Mirjana Spoljaric to Qatar earlier this week, explained how the Red Cross sees its fundamental role, relatively unchanged for more than a century."I look at my kids, I look at my brothers, and I say 'imagine now there is a front line between us, they are captured, and I can't see them'. Or worse, you have no news, you don't know. "So when we manage to reunite people, it's something hard to describe, this sense of purpose," he says.	
27/11/2023 11:34:00	US Navy seizes attackers who held Israel-linked tanker - BBC News	A US Navy warship has captured armed men who seized an Israeli-linked tanker off the coast of Yemen on Sunday, US defence officials say.The assailants attempted to escape on a boat but were chased by the US warship.US Central Command reported that two missiles were then fired towards the warship from rebel Houthi-controlled territory in the country. The Houthis have promised to target Israel over its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel launched its retaliatory campaign after the 7 October attack in southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage.Since then, more than 14,500 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip, roughly 40% of them children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Houthis declare themselves part of an "axis of resistance" of Iran-affiliated groups.  The tanker attacked on Sunday was identified as the Central Park by the vessel's company. Central Park is managed by Zodiac Maritime Ltd, a London-headquartered international ship management company owned by Israel's Ofer family. Zodiac Maritime said that among the 22 crew were Russian, Vietnamese, Bulgarian, Indian, Georgian and Filipino nationals, as well as a Turkish captain.The rebels are reported to have threatened to attack the tanker, which was carrying phosphoric acid, if it did not divert to a Yemeni port.In a statement, the US military said the USS Mason, with help from allied ships, demanded that the commercial ship be released by the attackers.Five armed individuals then tried to escape on a fast boat but were chased by the USS Mason and they eventually surrendered, the statement added.Two missiles were then fired towards the warship but landed far from the vessel, the US said.The incidents are the latest in a series of attacks undertaken by the Houthis.They fired several missiles and drones towards Israel just after Israel launched its operation.The US said at the time that all the missiles and drones were intercepted by its warship in the Red Sea.Houthi rebels last week said they seized an Israeli cargo ship in the Red Sea. Israel said the ship was not Israeli, and no Israelis were among its crew. The Houthis have been locked in a prolonged civil war with Yemen's official government - backed by Saudi Arabia - since 2014.	
27/11/2023 10:37:00	Israel-Lebanon border: The Irish troops watching Israel’s hidden conflict - BBC News	"If you hear an alarm sounding it means you need to run to the nearest bunker," says Captain Aódhan McGuinness as we arrive at Camp Shamrock. He is the tactical operations director for the Irish troops who run this UN peacekeeping base close to the Lebanon-Israel border. We can hear the buzz of Israeli drones hovering overhead. They sound like hair dryers or electric razors, and are now a constant presence day and night above towns and villages in southern Lebanon. A loud explosion nearby interrupts Captain McGuinness' safety briefing. "Ok, today's round has started," he says. The blast is yet another sign of escalating tensions in the area since Hamas launched its unprecedented assault on Israel back in October.The UN peacekeeping mission, known as Unifil, is responsible for monitoring the Blue Line, the unofficial frontier between Lebanon and Israel.During the last four decades the area has witnessed on and off clashes between the Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group, Hezbollah, and the Israeli army. While Hezbollah is labelled a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and others, it is a mainstream political party in Lebanon, leading an alliance which fell just short of a majority in the national parliament in elections last year.Wearing body armour and helmets we join a group of heavily armed peacekeepers in a convoy of armoured vehicles for a 20-minute drive to another base that is just 500m (1,600ft) from the Blue Line. With Israeli military installations visible across the frontier, the commander of the outpost, Lieutenant Dylan Cadogan, says they often have to take shelter in bunkers during strikes, sometimes for hours. "We have seen houses destroyed and we have seen civilians caught in crossfire that needed our help."From the base's watchtower he points at a pink house in the distance: "There was a mother and a child in that building only 400m (1,300ft) from us. "Their house was shelled, and they had to run here to take refuge and we provided them with medical support and took them to safety." The Unifil troops have recovered the bodies of people killed in the fighting but cannot say how many were Hezbollah fighters due to the sensitivity of their mission and the need to remain neutral between the warring parties. "It is not our job to comment on these, just observe, monitor and report what we see to our headquarters," Lieutenant Cadogan says. Since Israel launched its offensive on Gaza following Hamas's attack on 7 October, Hezbollah has regularly carried out rocket and drone attacks from southern Lebanon, some aimed at military targets, others fired more indiscriminately into northern Israel. Israeli forces have retaliated with heavy air strikes and artillery fire. Due to the fighting 60,000 people have been displaced from the border area on the Lebanese side, while thousands of Israelis have been evacuated from northern Israel. Monitoring groups say that in the first week following Hamas's attack in October there were around 70 reported incidents near the Blue Line, and by mid-November it had risen to about 250 attacks a week. The peacekeeping force was first deployed in 1978 after Israel invaded southern Lebanon in response to cross border attacks from there by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). Since then, more than 300 peacekeepers have been killed, 48 of them Irish, something which is on the minds of the troops' families. Captain Tony Smith, 27, on his second deployment, regularly reassures his relatives back home in Wexford, in south east Ireland. "Of course my mother wants me to go home now, which eventually I will, but she knows why we are here and despite her concerns she supports that."Approaching the nearby town of Tebnine, posters of Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah and fallen Hezbollah fighters line the road. It's 10km (6.2 miles) from the Blue Line and has been heavily damaged in previous conflicts. Like most of the towns and villages in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah is very influential here and controls security in the area. One of the local residents, 57-year-old Ali Saad, says he grew up with the Irish Unifil soldiers.Speaking with a distinctive Irish accent, Ali says one peacekeeper helped teach him English when he was a young boy. That soldier was one of three generations of the same Irish family to serve with Unifil. His father also served several decades ago, and his son is currently stationed in Lebanon.Ali credits the Irish troops with helping to save his life when they picked him up from school and took him to one of their bunkers during an air strike. In the years since, he has worked as a translator for Unifil and a group of Irish soldiers even attended his wedding to his wife, Bassima, who also helps the peacekeepers with language services. But while Ali values the troops' presence, he is sad that the conflict they are there to monitor has dragged on so long. "To be honest we never thought this mission would last for over 44 years," he says. For Bassima the current fighting has brought back painful memories of earlier conflicts, like the Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. "I was putting my younger son inside an empty washing machine because I was hoping that it could project him," she says. "Now, we keep hearing all these sounds of explosions and I just can't take it."She believes that growing up surrounded by conflict has affected her son, who is now 23. He still gets nervous when Unifil helicopters fly overhead.  "We can't go back to where we were," she adds. "We are wasting our life from one conflict to another, I just cannot go through another war."Back at the base, Unifil commander Lieutenant Colonel Cathal Keohane is concerned that the level of violence in the area has been increasing."We have seen an expansion and more attacks deeper inside to Lebanon, we have seen a wider range of weapons being used," he says, worrying that the situation could escalate. "Whether it arises deliberately from one side, or some inadvertent circumstances precipitate the outbreak of all-out war, that is a serious concern for us."He hopes that the ceasefire in Gaza will lead to an easing of tensions around the Blue Line, but says it could take displaced people some time to return to their homes, even if the cross border fire ends. 	
27/11/2023 06:00:00	UAE planned to use COP28 climate talks to make oil deals - BBC News	The United Arab Emirates planned to use its role as the host of UN climate talks as an opportunity to strike oil and gas deals, the BBC has learned.Leaked briefing documents reveal plans to discuss fossil fuel deals with 15 nations.The UN body responsible for the COP28 summit told the BBC hosts were expected to act without bias or self-interest.The UAE team did not deny using COP28 meetings for business talks, and said "private meetings are private".It declined to comment on what was discussed in the meetings and said its work has been focused on "meaningful climate action".The documents - obtained by independent journalists at the Centre for Climate Reporting working alongside the BBC - were prepared by the UAE's COP28 team for meetings with at least 27 foreign governments ahead of the COP28 summit, which starts on 30 November.They included proposed "talking points", such as one for China which says Adnoc, the UAE's state oil company, is "willing to jointly evaluate international LNG [liquefied natural gas] opportunities" in Mozambique, Canada and Australia.The documents suggest telling a Colombian minister that Adnoc "stands ready" to support Colombia to develop its fossil fuel resources.There are talking points for 13 other countries, including Germany and Egypt, which suggest telling them Adnoc wants to work with their governments to develop fossil fuel projects.The briefings show the UAE also prepared talking points on commercial opportunities for its state renewable energy company, Masdar, ahead of meetings with 20 countries, including the UK, United States, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Brazil, China, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kenya.COP28 is the UN's latest round of global climate talks. This year it is being hosted by the UAE in Dubai and is due to be attended by 167 world leaders, including the Pope and King Charles III.These summits are the world's most important meetings to discuss how to tackle climate change.The hope is COP28 will help limit the long-term global temperature rise to 1.5C, which the UN's climate science body says is crucial to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. But that will require drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, it says - a 43% reduction by 2030 from 2019 levels. As part of the preparations for the conference, the UAE's COP28 team arranged a series of ministerial meetings with governments from around the world.The meetings were to be hosted by the president of COP28, Dr Sultan al-Jaber. Each year the host nation appoints a representative to be the COP president.Meeting representatives of foreign governments is one of the core responsibilities of COP presidents. It is the president's job to encourage countries to be as ambitious as possible in their efforts to cut emissions.The leaked briefing documents seen by the BBC were prepared for Dr Jaber - who is also CEO of the UAE's giant state oil company, Adnoc, and of the state renewables business, Masdar.The documents contain a summary of objectives for the meetings, including information about the minister or official Dr Jaber was due to meet and what issues he should raise in the UAE's efforts to progress the climate talks.For more than two dozen countries, the documents also contain talking points drawn up by Adnoc and Masdar:The BBC has seen an email exchange in which COP28 staff members are told Adnoc and Masdar talking points "always need to be included" in the briefing notes. The COP28 team said it was "simply untrue" that staff had been told this.It is not clear on how many occasions Dr Jaber and his colleagues raised the talking points in COP28 meetings with foreign governments.We know, on at least one occasion, a nation followed up on commercial discussions brought up in a meeting arranged by the UAE's COP28 team.However, 12 nations have told the BBC there was either no discussion of commercial activities during meetings, or a meeting did not take place.  These included the UK. The leaked documents show the COP28 president had been briefed to "seek government support" to more than double the size of a wind farm off the coast of Sheringham in Norfolk in which Masdar has a stake. Attempting to do business deals during the COP process appears to be a serious breach of the standards of conduct expected of a COP president.Those standards are set by the UN body responsible for the climate negotiations, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).The UNFCCC says the "cardinal principle" for COP presidents and their teams is "the obligation of impartiality".It told the BBC that COP presidents are "expected to act without bias, prejudice, favouritism, caprice, self-interest, preference or deference, strictly based on sound, independent and fair judgement"."They are also expected to ensure that personal views and convictions do not compromise or appear to compromise their role and functions as a UNFCCC officer," it continued.Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the head of the COP20 summit in Peru in 2014, worries a collapse in trust could mean no progress on tackling climate change in Dubai. "The president of the COP is the leader of the world, is trying to build consensus on behalf of the planet," he told the BBC."If any president of the COP tries to bring a particular interest, [including] commercial interest, that could mean the failure of the COP."Prof Michael Jacobs of Sheffield University, who is an expert on UN climate politics, told the BBC the COP28 team's actions looked "breathtakingly hypocritical"."I actually think it's worse than that," he said, "because the UAE at the moment is the custodian of a United Nations process aimed at reducing global emissions. And yet, in the very same meetings where it's apparently trying to pursue that goal, it's actually trying to do side deals which will increase global emissions."Several of the proposed projects mentioned in the briefing documents appear to represent new oil and gas developments. The International Energy Agency, a global watchdog, has said that to keep temperature rises to the 1.5C target, no new oil and gas fields should be developed.At a press conference last month, COP28 director-general Majid al-Suwaidi said the UAE's climate summit team was "fully independent" of both Adnoc and Masdar.COP28 has been "very clear about our independence" in discussions with the UNFCCC, he added.In a statement, the COP28 team told the BBC: "The fact that Dr Sultan al-Jaber holds a number of positions alongside his role as COP28 president-designate is public knowledge and something we have been transparent about from the outset."Dr Sultan al-Jaber is singularly focused on the business of COP and delivering ambitious and transformational climate outcomes at COP28," the statement said, adding it would be a "distraction" to suggest that the work he has undertaken has not "been focused on meaningful climate action".  These are serious allegations but ultimately the success of the UAE's leadership of the climate talks, and of the COP28 president himself, will be judged by the results achieved at the summit, experts say.  The COP28 summit is due to end on Tuesday 12 December.

27/11/2023 05:59:00	Swansea University: Rare Egyptian artefacts come to Wales - BBC News	Hundreds of rare Egyptian artefacts dating back as far as 7,000 years ago are set to be displayed until May. Swansea University's Egypt Centre will host 800 items in a collection on loan from Harrogate Museum for three years. The university's experts will analyse the objects, in the hope of improving understanding of antiquity.The artefacts range from 1,400 to 7,000 years old, and come from across the ancient Egyptian world.But despite their disparate origins, the Egypt Centre's curator, Dr Ken Griffin, said they were all linked by the Egyptians' desire for their names to be recalled by future generations.He said that desire was the reason the first exhibition of 30 items had been entitled Causing Their Names to Live."The thing which jumps out at you is the number of artefacts which bear phrases around a variation of causing their name to live," he said."There's a popular misconception that the Egyptians were obsessed with death, but the opposite is true. Everything was about being remembered on earth, so that their souls would live on in the afterlife."He added that the collection dispelled the myth that tombs were laden with curses in order to keep people out."They wanted people to visit to promote these acts of remembrance," he said."Many inscriptions offer inducements to visit, to the effect of: 'If you make an offering at my tomb, I'll put in a word for your own soul with the gods in the afterlife'."The curses only referred to anyone who sought to desecrate or rob a tomb; then they could frequently be threatened with being stung by a scorpion or eaten by a crocodile."The collection includes: coffin fragments; funeral cones which would have stood at the entrance to a tomb; sculptures of the person's living form, known as shabti; and stelae, carved drawings of events from their life.The centrepiece is a seated stone statue of Senetre, daughter of Egyptian scribe Nebamun, bearing an inscription urging people to remember his daughter.Dr Griffin said: "This statue tells us two things.  Firstly, for high-ranking families like Nebamun's, the acts of remembrance were also about dynastic control.  "We think we're into ancestry these days…the Egyptians could recite 10 or 15 generations of their lineage, it was a means of enforcing their right to rule."Secondly, Senetre's young age shows how dangerous life was, even for high-born families."Wild animals, disease, death in childbirth and infant mortality all meant the average life expectancy was around 35, so they needed this belief system to show there was more to the spirit than the human body."Dr Griffin added our understanding of Egyptology could only be improved through collaborations such as this loan, likening the process of interpretation to "a massive game of Wordle"."Often we're not aware of what institutions have in each other's collections, so it's only by sharing that we can improve our understanding," he said.The loan coincides with the Egypt Centre's 25th anniversary, and Dr Griffin says it showed how far they've come in a short time. But he added there were still some advantages to remaining small."The British Museum has over 100,000 Egyptian antiquities, and is only able to display a tiny fraction of them. All of our 7,000 are available to view by appointment, and 2,000 are permanently exhibited," he said.	
28/11/2023 23:00:00	Israel says 12 more hostages released by Hamas have left Gaza - BBC News		
27/11/2023 00:21:00	More Palestinian teen prisoners freed amid hopes of extended hostage deal - BBC News	A further 39 Palestinians have been freed from Israeli prisons in the third exchange for hostages being held in Gaza. They were released as part of an agreement which has seen 40 Israeli hostages taken on 7 October returned.It brings the total number of Palestinians released since the first swap on Friday to 117.A last exchange is expected on Monday under the current deal agreed by Israel and Hamas, but it could be extended.Among the latest Palestinian prisoners to be freed was teenager Mohammed Al-Awar, who spent 16 months in jail. His mother said she had mixed feelings about his release."Our joy is incomplete because of the huge number of people killed in Gaza," she said in a video showing their reunion. Another teenager, Abdurahman Al-Zaghal, was also freed but was not with the others as he is in an Israeli hospital receiving medical treatment. He was shot in the head and hit by shrapnel in the lower part of his body in August as he went out to buy bread, according to his uncle. Israeli authorities said he was trying to throw a petrol bomb on a settlement post in the area.Al-Zaghal's trial was held in absentia as he was still in intensive care. He was seen on Sunday removing an electronic bracelet from his leg. As in the earlier nights of prisoner swaps, large crowds took to the streets in the West Bank - where detainees are being returned to initially - to greet the coaches carrying the released prisoners. Footage shows some of those released being paraded around on people's shoulders, while other members of the crowd wave Palestinian flags. Israel has compiled a list of 300 Palestinian prisoners, mainly teenage boys, who are eligible for release under the deal struck with Hamas.Under a deal brokered with the help of Qatar, 50 Israeli hostages - women and children - were to be freed by Hamas over four days during a ceasefire, in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners.Some 40 Israeli hostages in total have been freed so far, alongside 18 foreign nationals. Israel previously said the ceasefire could be extended if at least 10 Israelis were released daily. However, the government has vowed to wipe out Hamas and added that any cessation in its attacks was only temporary. Hamas said on Sunday that it wanted to extend the agreement and increase the number of hostages released. A senior Palestinian official familiar with negotiations taking place in Qatar told the BBC the group has informed mediators it is willing to extend the pause by two to four days, and that an extension could see the release of an additional 20 to 40 Israeli prisoners.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the framework deal as a "blessed thing", also apparently hinting that it could be extended.Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman told the Financial Times that the group would need to locate dozens of hostages held in Gaza by other groups in order to secure an extension.Many of those kidnapped in the 7 October attacks - thought to be about 240 people - are being held by Hamas, an Iran-backed Islamist group that is categorised as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, the US and the European Union.However, groups including Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which also participated, are believed to be holding some.Some 1,200 people, most of them civilians were killed in the 7 October raid, according to Israel. In retaliation for the attack, Israel has bombed Gaza relentlessly, wrecking its infrastructure.Hamas says nearly 15,000 people have died, including many children. Large supplies of aid - notably food, water and hygiene kits - are desperately needed.	
26/11/2023 15:29:00	Palestinian teenager 'dizzy with happiness' to be freed - BBC News	Thirty-nine Palestinian teenagers and women were freed from Israeli prisons on Saturday after the ceasefire deal looked to be in peril. They were released as part of an agreement which has seen 26 Israeli hostages taken on 7 October returned. It takes the total number of Palestinians released since the start of the temporary ceasefire to 78.One of those released, Mohammad dar-Darwish, 17, said he was "dizzy with happiness" to return home. The exchange was delayed after Hamas accused Israel of changing the agreed list of prisoners it would release.Hamas also said that not enough aid shipments that had been guaranteed access to Gaza as part of the deal had made it through. But the handover went ahead after last-minute mediation involving Qatar and Egypt.Israel denied breaking the terms of the agreement, which entered its third day on Sunday.On Saturday night, a crowd of people - including some waving the green flag of Hamas - greeted a coach carrying released Palestinians as it made its way through the West Bank, where detainees are being returned to initially. Six of them were women, while all the others were under the age of 18.  Among them was Mohammad dar-Darwish, who was held in an Israeli jail for seven months accused of throwing a petrol bomb at soldiers. He denies the charge.He said he was "dizzy with happiness" when he returned home and found his father and brother in the crowd waiting to greet the detainees.Speaking to the BBC, he claimed Palestinian prisoners were mistreated after the 7 October attack. Israel's prison service says it treats prisoners lawfully.Israel has compiled a list of 300 Palestinian prisoners, mainly teenage boys, who are eligible for release under the deal struck with Hamas.Most are in prison awaiting trial, with less than a quarter of those on the list having been convicted.Among the adult women released was Israa Jaabis, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2015 when her car burst into flames 1.5km (0.9 miles) from a checkpoint in the West Bank.Israel said it was an attempted car bombing and she was convicted, but Israa Jaabis - now 38 - denied the charge, and her family has previously claimed the fire started because of an engine fault.She suffered serious facial burns after the car's engine caught fire, but had requests for surgery turned down by Israel's prison authorities.After being released eight years into her sentence, she was pictured hugging her son Mua'tassim, 15, who was eight years old at the time of his mother's arrest.Some of those released under the ceasefire deal are prisoners who were still children when they were arrested.Marah Bakeer was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years for a knife attack on a border police officer when she was 16.After returning to her family in East Jerusalem, she said "I'm emotional, it's a very good feeling", and said she only found out about her release hours before it happened.Nourhan Awad, 23, served eight years of her 10 year sentence before being released on Saturday. She was convicted over a stabbing in Jerusalem, and was shot by police during her arrest. Her cousin was shot and killed during the arrest.She was filmed running to her family in Qalandia, West Bank, after her release, and said she would visit the grave of her cousin before returning home.A second group of Israeli hostages - all women and children - were released from Gaza on Saturday evening.More detainees and hostages are set to be released on Sunday as part of the agreement.	
26/11/2023 14:16:00	West Bank: Eight Palestinians killed during Israeli raid - BBC News	Eight Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank in the past 24 hours, according to the Palestinian health ministry.The most serious incident was an Israeli raid overnight in the city of Jenin, in which five were killed.The Israeli army said it was mounting a raid to capture a Palestinian who was suspected of involvement in an ambush that killed two Israelis in August.Palestinian factions have called for a strike in Jenin to mourn those killed.The West Bank has seen almost daily clashes for more than a year and a half, after Israel suffered a wave of deadly violence by Palestinian militants. Israeli forces have gone into West Bank towns and cities in search of those suspected of being involved in shootings and stabbings or planning such attacks.  Jenin has been a flashpoint, and hundreds of Palestinians - both fighters and civilians - have been killed.Back in July, Israeli forces launched an incursion into the city's refugee camp, which is regarded as a hotbed of militants. Thirteen Palestinians were killed in the fiercest confrontation in the West Bank for 20 years.  In addition, Israeli settlers have responded to killings carried out by Palestinian gunmen with rampages in Palestinian towns and villages.  So, the area was already at boiling point before the Hamas assault on Israel on 7 October.In the weeks since then, the UN says some 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or settlers in a new escalation of the conflict. Four Israelis have been killed by Palestinians.Even as Israel has been fighting a war with Hamas in Gaza, it has tightened its controls on the West Bank in a bid to prevent a spill-over of the conflict.  But this appears only to have further undermined the Palestinian Authority and boosted the rise of militant groups in Jenin and beyond. 	
26/11/2023 13:08:00	For many Israeli hostage families, the painful wait goes on - BBC News	Avi Shamriz was keeping busy during the day. No job was too small. The families in the hotel needed new clothes, new phones. The free shop needed be kept stocked. Movies for the kids. A birthday party. He wandered the grounds, checking in on people. "I don't stop," he said.But at night, when the hotel was quiet and the small jobs were all done, Avi could no longer distract himself from thinking about his son."I'm thinking, is he safe? Are they treating him well? Does he have enough food? Is he sick, is he injured? Does he have clothes to wear? He is in a tunnel, do they have a shower? It must be dark there. Is it cold?"Alon Shamriz, a 26-year-old student of computer engineering from the Kfar Aza kibbutz near the border with Gaza, is believed to have been taken hostage when Hamas stormed the kibbutz during its 7 October attack on Israel. This is what the family hopes - that he is in Gaza. They know that Alon was not found among the dead.On Friday afternoon, Avi and his family were sitting in the grounds of a hotel near Tel Aviv that is now home to about 400 people displaced from Kfar Aza. Dotted among the families at the hotel are a few like Avi's, with loved ones among the hostages.As Avi sat on his garden chair, describing his sleepless nights, all of Israel awaited the release of the first 13 hostages in a few hours' time, in exchange for 39 Palestinian prisoners.It was a day of mixed emotions. Dozens of families knew that their loved one would almost certainly not be among the 50 hostages due to be released as part of the deal struck between Israel and Hamas, because mothers and children had been prioritised. "On one hand, I am happy that this has begun, because it might continue," Avi said. "But right now I don't trust anyone. I don't trust Hamas, I don't trust my own government to keep doing the right thing. So, I have nothing. Only to wait."All over Israel this weekend, families were bracing for footage of the first hostages being returned home, knowing that their pain and uncertainty would endure. Naama Weinberg, whose cousin Itai Svirsky, 38, is also believed to be among the hostages, watched the exchange from her apartment in Tel Aviv. "I sat in front of the news for hours, my eyes glued to the screen," she said on Saturday. "I was crying from happiness and joy, I texted the families of the people who came out to send them love."But there was also some jealousy, she said. "Itai is my cousin. He is my family. I want everyone back, of course, but I really want him back."Along with some other hostage families, Naama's family is facing a daunting scenario: both of Itai's parents were killed in the attack but it isn't clear whether he knows."He was with his mother at the house when the attack happened, but we don't know what he saw," Naama said. "Did he see her being murdered before he was taken? Or was he taken before she was murdered? "Was her son being taken away the last thing my aunt saw?"The family knew they would have to break it to Itai that his father, who was killed in a separate building, was gone."The healing process is going to be extremely difficult," Naama said, tears forming in her eyes. "Itai is going to come home an orphan."By the end of Monday, 50 Israeli hostages should have been released along with 15 foreign nationals, and 150 Palestinian detainees freed by Israel in return, facilitated by a four-day ceasefire. Israel has prioritised the release of the elderly, mothers, and children. About 150 Israelis will still be in Gaza, their families forced to endure longer. "I want to hope, but I don't think she will be involved in this deal," said Yamit Ashkenazi, whose 30-year-old sister Doron, a veterinary nurse, is believed to be in Gaza. Like a few of the relatives, Yamit has a new tattoo. It reads, 'As the sun we will rise again,' but some of the sun's rays are missing. "They will be added when she is home," Yamit said.Israeli authorities did not confirm to family members in advance whether their loved ones were expected to be released this weekend or not, but families like Yamit's - and Avi's and Naama's - had already reconciled themselves to the fact that their relatives did not fit the criteria."I am a mother also, so I understand why the children have to come out first," Yamit said. "But Doron is my parents' young daughter. She is a human being. Behind every number there is a person with a story and relatives. So we must get them all back, not just certain categories."Yamit and her parents were preparing on Saturday to travel to central Tel Aviv for a massive rally to call for all the hostages to be brought home. This rally was going to be particularly big, to coincide with the first hostage release, but Yamit's family had been going every Saturday to the newly renamed Hostages Square, to call for everyone to be brought back.Naama Weinberg was also at the rally. "It's exhausting to fight this fight, but we can't quit until he's home," she said. "Until all the hostages are home."The exhaustion was visible on Naama's face, and on the faces of the other family members who were still waiting. They had endured 50 days of campaigning, of media appearances, of lying awake at night thinking about their loved ones in Gaza. The deal this weekend had given them some hope, they all said. But it also brought fear that something could go wrong."I'm scared that it might give the world the feeling that the trade is done, that we got some of the hostages back and it will all quiet down," Naama said."The situation is very sensitive, anyone can blow it," Avi Shamriz said. "Someone says something wrong, somebody shoots someone, and we are back to square one."And then there was the bombing of Gaza, Avi said. "The government say they are being careful, but you cannot be careful when you are dropping bombs," he said. "You just don't know who you are going to hit."As the hostage families gathered with thousands of others in central Tel Aviv on Saturday night, Avi was back in his hotel room. He did not believe in the power of the rallies. He thought they were counter-productive. "I am doing my best to do work behind the scenes," he said. He was also quietly preparing for his son's return. Alon's Toyota Camry was destroyed in the Hamas attack, so a few weeks ago Avi set up a fundraiser to buy him a new one. When Toyota Israel found out, it donated a used Camry for free. "It doesn't have a sunroof like Alon's did, but that's OK," Avi said. "It will be ready for him when he comes home."Idan Ben Ari contributed to this report. Photographs by Joel Gunter	
26/11/2023 09:32:00	More hostages released by Hamas despite agonising delay - BBC News	A second group of Israeli hostages left Hamas captivity on Saturday, after hours of delay had increased the anxiety of desperate families.The Israeli military said 13 Israelis were released in Gaza and in exchange 39 more Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel in the West Bank. Hamas also released four Thai hostages.The first releases took place smoothly on Friday, under a temporary four-day truce deal brokered by Qatar.Urgent talks saved Saturday's handover.The Israelis had been expected to be handed over to the Red Cross on Gaza's border with Egypt at 16:00 (14:00 GMT).The Hamas armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, said there were issues over the delivery of aid to northern Gaza and the selection criteria for Palestinian prisoners being exchanged for captives held by Hamas. Israel denied violating the terms of the deal.Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said a total of 340 aid trucks had gone into Gaza since Friday, but only 65 had reached northern Gaza - which he said was less than half of what Israel had agreed on. Israel describes the north as a war zone and says the UN is responsible for delivering the aid.Later a senior Palestinian official close to the talks confirmed Qatar's statement that the dispute had been resolved.And Hamas voiced "appreciation towards Egypt and Qatar for ensuring the continuation of their temporary truce with Israel".Under the deal, 50 Israeli hostages - women and children - are to be freed by Hamas over four days, in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners.The Israeli government says the truce could be extended if at least 10 Israelis are released daily - but it has also vowed to wipe out Hamas and insists the deal is only temporary. Hamas kidnapped about 240 people when it raided southern Israel on 7 October, and killed 1,200, most of them civilians, Israel says. The Iran-backed Islamist group is categorised as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, the US and the European Union.In retaliation for the 7 October attack Israel has bombed Gaza relentlessly, wrecking its infrastructure. Hamas says nearly 15,000 people have died, including many children. Large supplies of aid - notably food, water and hygiene kits - are desperately needed.On Saturday evening some 50,000 people rallied in central Tel Aviv with the slogan "Bring them back home" on posters and t-shirts, hoping that the fragile truce would hold.Two of the Israeli hostages who were released late on Saturday were siblings Noam and Alma Or, 17 and 13 respectively. In the 7 October attacks, they were seen by a neighbour being dragged out of their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, along with their father, according to their nephew. Their father has not been released.Their mother was killed in the attack, but the teenagers did not know this, their uncle, Ahal Besorai, told the BBC."We had to bring the sad news to them," he said.Dr Shoshan Haran, 67, was also kidnapped from Be'eri and released on Saturday. She is the founder of a not-for-profit organisation to help feed those in poverty and has a PhD in agronomy. She was freed along with her daughter Adi Shoham, 38, and her children, Nave, eight, and Yahel, three. Also released were Sharon Avigdori, 52, a drama therapist, and her daughter Noam, 12, who are relatives of Dr Haran and were kidnapped from Be'eri at the same time. Another child who was released yesterday is Emily Hand, who turned nine while in captivity. The Irish-Israeli girl had been held hostage without any of her family with her.Emily's father, Tom Hand, who was originally told Emily had been killed, told the BBC that he was determined to keep doing everything he could to help bring the other hostages home.Most of the 39 Palestinians released by Israel on Friday - 24 women and 15 teenage boys - were in pre-trial detention. One of them, Sarah al-Suwaisa, said the Israelis had fired teargas and cut off the prisoners' electricity before the release. She called it "humiliating, psychological torture" and said "only Hamas helped us".A crowd gathered again in Beitunia on Saturday to receive more released Palestinians - women and teenagers who were held at Ofer prison. Many green Hamas flags were displayed there, the BBC's Lucy Williamson reports.Among those freed was Nourhan Awad, 23, who was arrested in 2015 on suspicion of being involved in a stabbing operation in Jerusalem. She served eight of the 10 years she was sentenced to. Israa Jaabis had also been in prison since 2015 after her car broke down on a highway 1.5km (0.9 miles) from a checkpoint in the West Bank. Israel said at the time that it was an attempted car bombing but this has been disputed. Meanwhile, Thailand's Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said that the four Thai nationals released on Saturday were doing well."Everybody is safe, on the whole in good mental health and are able to speak normally," he wrote on social media. 	
26/11/2023 09:16:00	Syrian asylum seeker says masters degree is a 'dream come true' - BBC News	An asylum seeker from Syria has received a masters degree after having to flee his home country and abandon his studies there.Mohamed Hady Taresh graduated with a first class masters degree in cyber security from the University of Gloucestershire on Friday.Mr Taresh was forced to leave Syria in 2013 because of the ongoing civil war.He said: "It's a dream come true and especially in these circumstances and the challenges we faced."Mr Taresh arrived in the UK in 2022 seeking refuge and a better future for his wife, Jollanar and their five-year-old daughter Alice.He had a 10-year career working in various IT management roles in Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Cyprus.But with an armed conflict displacing millions of people, Mr Taresh said coming to the UK was a "life or death matter" for his family. "I remember the day that we had to leave the city [Raqqa] because the city [fell down] in a very dramatic situation," he said.The family fled to England and arrived at a hotel in Cheltenham in middle of the night."My wife was scared because we came in the middle of the night," he said."[But] the moment we wake up, it was something magical, because of the green landscapes of the countryside and the feeling that we are safe right now."Mr Taresh was not legally permitted to work in the UK while his asylum application was processed by the Home Office, so he decided to return to education."I rebuilt myself from scratch," said Mr Taresh, who became the first postgraduate student to be awarded the University of Gloucestershire's Michael Perham Sanctuary Scholarship.The scholarship helped him to cover living expenses by providing support such as food vouchers and travel tickets to and from campus.He received a first-class master's degree in Cyber Security, which he received at the university's graduation ceremony at Cheltenham Racecourse on Friday."This is the moment that I was dreaming about. I can't find the words to express what I feel right now," he said.Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk 	
25/11/2023 15:27:00	Gaza truce: Palestinians search for loved ones and check damaged homes - BBC News	People have been waiting in long queues for fuel and aid in the Gaza Strip, as the four-day truce between Israel and Hamas appears to hold for a second day.Gazans are trying to make the most of the pause in fighting to gather much-needed supplies, search for loved ones and even take a walk by the sea.Some have visited their homes - or what is left of them - to see damage and recover what they can find.The truce has also seen more supplies allowed into the Palestinian territory.Israel imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip as it launched its retaliatory operation aimed at eliminating Hamas, following its 7 October attack in which militants killed at least 1,200 people in southern Israel and took more than 240 hostages.Since then, more than 14,500 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The four-day truce, mediated by Qatar, is meant to result in the release of 50 hostages and 150 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held in Israeli jails.  On the first day of the truce on Friday, around 150 trucks carried supplies into the Gaza Strip from Egypt. While it was the biggest amount of aid to enter Gaza since the first convoy crossed the border on 21 October, the UN says more is still needed.Communications are largely down across Gaza, however pictures emerging from the Strip show long queues for fuel and other supplies in Rafah, in the south of the territory.Trucks have been waiting on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing early on Saturday morning, ready to carry in food, water, fuel and medical supplies.The Israeli military confirmed that four tankers containing fuel and another four carrying cooking gas entered Gaza on Saturday morning.It is a slow process to get over the border with every vehicle checked by the Israeli military before making the crossing.The Palestinian Red Crescent said 61 aid trucks carrying food supplies, drinking water and medicines had set off from Rafah towards the north of Gaza.It said this would be the largest aid convoy to reach the north since the beginning of the fighting.The Israeli government said it was expecting 226 aid trucks to enter through the Nitzana crossing in southern Israel. "This will include 113 trucks containing food, seven containing medical supplies, 27 containing water, 43 containing various supplies for shelter, 25 trucks containing hygiene supplies," spokesman Eytan Schwartz said. An additional 11 Egyptian trucks are carrying medical supplies to the Emirati hospital, he said.Despite joy for many at the cessation of fighting, it has been mixed with sadness after many returned to their destroyed homes to save what remained and retrieve the bodies of their loved ones from under the rubble.Tahani al-Najjar used the calm of the truce to return to the ruins of her Khan Younis home on Saturday, Reuters news agency reported.The 58-year-old pulled several intact cups from the rubble of her home, which she said had been destroyed by an Israeli air strike which also killed seven members of her family.In the southern city some people are living in makeshift tents outside the Nasser Hospital as they wait to decide whether to return to the north of the Strip.Crates of tomatoes, lemons, aubergines, peppers, onions and oranges could be seen at a street market in the city.Juliette Touma, spokesperson for the UN Relief and Works Agency, Unrwa, told the BBC the situation on the ground was "absolutely terrible" and, while the aid which had reached Gaza was welcome, the organisation was ready to receive much more.She said there was a need for basic hygiene items as well as more medical equipment, fuel and food.People have described having to flee with only the clothes on their backs and most have been unable to wash properly.Many public shelters are extremely overcrowded, Unrwa said, with its schools and other facilities housing more than a million displaced people.	
25/11/2023 15:00:00	Israel's Palestinian prisoner release a 'window of hope' in West Bank - BBC News	By nightfall, the road in front of the Beitunia checkpoint had the feel of a restive festival, the sting of politics and tear gas mingling in the air.Small campfires flickered in front of a handful of green Hamas flags; there were many more Palestinian ones.The return of 39 Palestinians from Israeli prisons to their homes in the occupied West Bank was never just going to be a family affair.Israel's jailing of large numbers of people on security grounds is widely seen by Palestinians as a tool of the occupation.Charges range from murder and violent attacks on Israelis to stone-throwing. Many Palestinians say Israel is criminalising acts of resistance by an occupied people - the Israeli Prison Service (IPS) told the BBC all prisoners are detained "according to and under the provisions of the law".A quarter of the population of the West Bank has spent time in an Israeli jail; it is a shared experience.And more than 3,000 people have been arrested since the 7 October attacks - including almost 900 children - according to the Palestinian Prisoners' Club president, Abdallah Zughary. Many of these detainees have been placed in administrative detention without charge, he says."Most of them are civilians, not affiliated with any kind of political party or militant group," Mr Zughary told me. "Since 7 October, there have been no visits by families or lawyers to prisoners. And six prisoners have died." He accuses Israel of using the justice system as a "revenge policy".A spokesperson for the IPS told the BBC that over the past few weeks, "four national security prisoners died" in different circumstances and on different days. "We have no knowledge of the causes of death," they added.They refused to comment on the suggestion that families and lawyers had not been allowed to visit prisoners.There is little faith here in Israel's military courts, which are responsible for policing an occupied population, and which human rights groups have accused of handing down guilty verdicts to Palestinians 99% of the time.The release of 39 women and teenagers is a tiny drop in the ocean of prisoners, but a massive symbol for Palestinians of their ability to - occasionally - force Israel's hand.Mustafa Barghouti, a senior Palestinian politician, told me that prisoners were a key part of the deal agreed between Israel and Hamas, and a key part of why that deal was good for Palestinians.It should also be taken as a sign, he said, that a permanent ceasefire was possible, despite Israel's insistence on resuming the war after the hostage deal has run its course."Israel has said many things before," Dr Barghouti told me. "They said they would kill Hamas. Now they are negotiating with them."Israel has said its goals of eliminating Hamas and getting the hostages back are not in conflict, but some in its army worry that the deal could allow their enemy to regroup.It has also strengthened the political standing of Hamas here in the West Bank - many of those gathered to wait for the returning prisoners at Beitunia checkpoint credited the group, though others stressed that this moment belonged to all Palestinians."We would like that this happened without the hostages taken by Hamas," human rights lawyer Mohammed Khatib said.  "But Israel doesn't want [to do] this without paying the price. Without the Hamas hostages, Israel would not allow these people out."But, he said, it was also a "window of hope" for both Palestinians and Israelis."The end [goal] is that they must accept us as people, they must accept our right to exist."We are humans: we have names, families, lives. I see all of this in the eye of a child released from prison today."The return of prisoners here has been paved by a brutal attack, a devastating war and a hostage crisis."There's a joy in this release but it is incomplete joy," Abdallah Zughary told me, "because there's a big price Palestinians have paid over past 45 days."Eman Barghouti, welcoming home her sister-in-law Hanan today, told me her family would not celebrate the release publicly, out of respect for Palestinians killed, injured and displaced by Israel's bombardment of Gaza. She said all the families she knew were doing the same.But the crowds swarming around the prisoners' bus as it crossed into Beitunia had no such reserve; a moment of happiness for prisoners' families is also a moment of victory for Palestinians across the West Bank.Behind the darkened windows, some of the prisoners could be seen dancing - one wrapped in a Palestinian flag.To Israel the prisoners it released today are a security threat. To the Palestinians gathered to greet them, they are victims of Israel's occupation - and their release is symbolic of a wider goal.	
25/11/2023 08:40:00	Israel-Gaza: Families' relief as hostages released - BBC News	Families of 13 Israeli hostages released by Hamas have spoken of their relief at their return.The group, which includes young children and elderly women, are now back in Israel after being brought by the Red Cross from Gaza into Egypt.Soon after, 39 Palestinian detainees were released across the Beitunia checkpoint in the West Bank.Ten Thai nationals and one Filipino were also released by Hamas, in a deal separate to the one mediated by Qatar.Under the terms of the Qatar deal, a total of 50 Israeli hostages and 150 Palestinian detainees are meant to be released over four days during a temporary pause in the fighting.The hostages released by Hamas on Friday were taken to an Egyptian hospital for medical assessments before being taken back to Israel. The Israelis include four children - aged two, four, six and nine - as well as an 85-year-old woman."We have now completed the return of the first of our hostages. Children, their mothers and other women. Each and every one of them is a entire world," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said."But I emphasise to you - the families, and to you - the citizens of Israel: We are committed to the return of all our hostages."Yoni Asher's wife, Doron Katz Asher, 34, and their two daughters Raz, four, and Aviv, two, have been released."I am determined to bring about the resurrection of my family from the trauma and the terrible bereavement we went through," Mr Asher told the BBC. "I don't celebrate, I won't celebrate until the last of the kidnapped returns," he said."The families of the kidnapped are not posters, they are not slogans, they are real people, and the families of the kidnapped are from today my new family, and I will make sure and do everything that the last of the kidnapped comes home."Margalit Moses, 78, was also among those released by Hamas. A cancer survivor, she was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas on 7 October.Daniele Aloni and her six-year-old daughter Emilia have also been released as part of the deal. They were kidnapped on 7 October during a visit to stay with family in Kibbutz Nir Oz.During the attacks, the last message Daniele sent to her family said that "there were terrorists in their house" and she was afraid that they would not survive.Itay Ravi, whose 78-year-old uncle Avraham remains in captivity, says "this is one step towards being happy" after three of his family members were released.His aunt, Ruthi Munder, 78, his cousin Keren Munder, 54, and her son, Ohad Munder-Zichri, nine, were kidnapped from Nir Oz."They're making their way now to Israeli hospitals, to family, and this is very exciting. However, we cannot be completely happy," he told BBC Newsnight. "It's still a very, very horrific reality that we're in," Mr Ravi added. Ohad turned nine while being held in Gaza."The only celebration that we're going to have soon is [for] Ohad's ninth birthday," Mr Ravi said. "Now we're going to have a big celebration for him, with all the friends and family, after he gets into the new reality. We'll see how he's back…I don't know how a nine-year-old comes back after 50 days in the hands of a terrorist organisation. I hope he does well."There was also huge relief among families of the Thai nationals and Filipino released by Hamas. Kittiya Thuengsaeng, the girlfriend of 28-year-old Thai hostage Wichai Kalapat, described the emotional rollercoaster she went through since he disappeared.She was told by local Thai officials that her boyfriend of three years had died in the 7 October attacks. But when Thai authorities announced all of the names of the deceased, Wichai's name was not on there.Five days ago, she was told he was on the list of Thai hostages.Urai Chantachart confirmed her brother Boonthom Pankhong, 39, and his girlfriend Natthawaree Mulakan were among the Thai hostages released by Hamas on Friday. Urai told BBC Thai that the family was "overjoyed" and that they had never lost faith that Boonthom was still alive. Looking at a photo released by the foreign affairs ministry, she said she thought her brother looked "better than expected", although he seemed to have lost weight. He and his girlfriend are now receiving receiving treatment at Shamir Medical Center in Israel, she added.Gelienor (Jimmy) Pacheco, 33, from the Philippines, was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7. Jimmy was a carer for fellow kibbutz resident Amitai Ben Zvi who was killed in the Hamas raid.The releases of Wichai, Jimmy, Boonthom and Natthawaree were confirmed on Saturday morning.A total of 39 Palestinian detainees have been released from Israeli prisons as part of the exchange.They are accused of a range of offences, from throwing stones to attempted murder. Some had been convicted of crimes while others were awaiting trial.The group of 24 women and 15 teenage boys was released across the Beituniya checkpoint in the occupied West Bank and greeted by large crowds chanting.One Palestinian detainee released was Marah Bakeer. She was arrested in 2015, when she was 16 years old, and sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in jail for a knife attack on a border police officer.Bakeer told waiting journalists: "This deal comes following the death of many people and this makes us unhappy and uncomfortable."She said she was kept in solitary confinement and had "no idea what was happening outside, no idea about the situation in Gaza"."The news of the deal was a surprise," she said.The detainees were chosen from a list of 300 women and minors compiled by Israel.Less than a quarter of those on the list have been convicted - the vast majority are being held on remand while awaiting trial. Most of those listed are teenage boys - 40% of them under the age of 18. There is also one teenage girl and 32 women.Hamas took more than 200 hostages during a cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed.Human rights organisations say the number of Palestinians held without charge in Israeli jails has shot up since the 7 October attacks.At least 60 aid lorries have entered Gaza since the pause in fighting - Israel says eight of the lorries are bringing in fuel, part of 130,000 litres to be delivered each day of the truce.Although the four-day ceasefire agreement suggests all areas should be accessible to aid agencies, Israel has told Palestinians now displaced in the south not to try to return home, saying the north is a war zone - although many thousands of civilians are believed to remain there.Additional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone	
26/11/2023 00:00:00	Israel releases 39 Palestinian prisoners after Hamas hands over 17 hostages - BBC News		
25/11/2023 00:54:00	Gaza hostages: 'My father wasn’t released, but I’m happy for those families' - BBC News	Maayan Kaplun Keidar believes her father, Dror Kaplun, is one of those held hostage by Hamas on the Gaza Strip since 7 October - although she does not know for sure. She did not expect him to be among those released in Friday's Israel-Hamas deal, but hopes the agreement paves the way for him, and all those being held hostage, to be freed at a later date.Dror lived with his wife on kibbutz Be'eri, a few kilometres from the border with Gaza, and one of the communities worst hit in the Hamas attacks. For the first few hours, Ms Kaplun Keidar said he was sending "horrifying" messages on the family Whatsapp group - including that Hamas fighters had entered the community and started burning houses - but communications eventually went quiet. "I was praying there was a network problem," she told BBC News. She has not heard from him since, but shortly after the attacks she saw a video online of him being marched through the streets by Hamas gunmen. Dror's wife, Marcelle Frailich Kaplun, can also been seen in the video, as can their neighbours, Ms Kaplun Keidar said. A few days later she received news that Marcelle's body had been found, as had those of the neighbours - she has received no such news about her father's body, leading her to believe he was taken back to Gaza. "Even if there's a 5% chance he's alive, I need to fight for him," she said. On Friday, Hamas released 24 hostages - including 13 Israelis - in a deal brokered by Qatar, the largest round of releases since the attacks. Mark Regev, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, described the release as "bittersweet", because most hostages were still in Gaza. Under the terms of the deal, 50 Israeli hostages - as well as 150 Palestinian detainees, 39 of which were released on Friday - are meant to be freed over four days during a temporary pause in fighting in the Gaza Strip. It had previously been reported that only women and children would be released, and Ms Kaplun Keidar was not expecting her father to be among the group - but she was watching developments closely. Speaking to the BBC shortly before the release was confirmed, she said she wanted to see it happen before celebrating - "you never know what might happen," she said. "But I'm very happy they are supposed to be released. I'm very happy for those families that will meet their loved ones, even if I'm not one of them," she said. Ms Kaplun Keidar added that she hoped this deal would mean more hostages would be released in the future. "Hopefully this will be the start of the release of everyone," she said, although she acknowledged that "anything could happen". Sharone Lifschitz is in a similar position. Her 83-year-old father, Oded, is missing, presumed to be held captive. Her mother Yocheved, 85, was one of only four people released by Hamas before Friday. An Israeli soldier was also freed in ground operations. Ms Lifschitz said dozens of people from her community, Nir Oz, were taken hostage. "So you can understand that these people we lived with all our lives," she told the BBC before the release was confirmed. "We know them, so there's a huge amount of anticipation." "But each person that will come back is a great joy, and obviously we also fear that our loved ones will not be on this list [of those released]," she said. Ms Lifschitz's father was also not expected to be released on Friday, and she said he would "fighting to be at the back of the queue". "He will be saying, 'No you go first'."While she said that each person released is a "ray of light", and that she was looking forward to seeing them, she added that the damage caused by the 7 October attacks is ongoing. She said that some of those released will be informed for the first time that their relatives or friends were killed."The trauma is not going to end - this is a long and horrendous story," she said. 	
25/11/2023 00:45:00	Khtek: The Moroccan rapper who is grateful to have bi-polar disorder - BBC News	Khtek is one of Morocco's most popular female rap artists. In fact, she's probably the brightest star of her generation in her country's female hip-hop firmament.In the three years since she burst onto the scene, she has won many fans, especially young women, with her bravery, openness and unwillingness to conform to expectations.For a start, she doesn't present herself as a star - whatever that means. When I meet Khtek, whose real name is Houda Abouz, in her favourite café in the middle of the bustling medina in Morocco's biggest city, Casablanca, she looks like the girl next door, relaxed jeans, crop top, body bag. The only concession to glamour is her shimmering eye make-up.On stage, performing with huge charisma for her adoring fans, she isn't much different - the crop top swapped for a silver bandeau. Khtek still appears to be presenting her authentic self, and the crowd loves her for it.Khtek's choice of name is itself a form of throwing down the gauntlet to men on behalf of women. In Darija, Moroccan Arabic, "khtek" means "your sister", she tells me, and it is used by men as a way of insulting one another. "They think that your sister is something sacred that can't be touched, a point of weakness. I used to listen to a lot to rap before even starting rapping and I noticed that a lot of people use the word 'khtek' to disrespect other rappers, to make fun of them. "And I was like: 'Why are we using this word in this way?'" Then she thought: "It might be interesting to become the sister that everyone is dissing and we're gonna see."It proved to be a smart move, because the name Khtek got her a lot of attention. Though at first, she says, radio hosts used to try to tone it down and call her "the sister", which is less offensive.Khtek started freestyling and performing at festivals even before she had recorded anything, but it was when she began sharing her art on her social media accounts that things really took off."I started receiving really huge feedback. I went from the little girl who rapped on the streets to becoming one of the biggest female rappers in Morocco - and I'm not saying that because of ego, just because it is true."In 2020 Khtek featured on a couple of songs with some of Morocco's biggest male rap stars - Hors Série with El Grande Toto, Draganov and Don Bigg, and Fratello with Tagne and Stormy.Khtek tells me she's been fascinated by the rap scene in Morocco and how it has evolved. "Back in 2013 there were two main things that were happening, which were like political rap, underground rap, rap that was really critiquing the system, the society we live in and touching big subjects and taking risks in their music, and other rappers that were just doing the music for the sake of the music, trying to make their names heard and take Moroccan hip-hop to another level," she says.Khtek feels that compared to the heady days of the Arab Spring, young people, including rappers, are no longer so interested in politics."Now people are only talking about cars, about going on vacation, about having money - before we didn't have Instagram, and influencers, seeing people on trips, brands, all of that mindset."We are not talking about serious subjects. That's why we are not getting arrested. People who are talking about serious subjects are getting arrested," she says.Khtek says she focuses on "things that really matter to me, which are mental health, women's rights, the situation I live in, the fact that we don't really have freedom of expression, even my contradictions, things that I see in myself and my society". Khtek talks about mental health with great openness in her music and in interviews. She herself has struggled with depression since she was a child, and she was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder in 2016. Khtek says the disorder, and the medication she now takes to regulate it, have brought challenges, including making her feel sluggish at times, and putting on weight, but overall she's very positive and feels passionate about communicating this."It's my reality, and it makes me who I am, because bi-polar disorder can be really related to creativity. A lot of the most amazing creatives in the world, even Kanye West, he is struggling with bi-polar disorder. "It makes me understand why certain people do certain things. It makes me see the world differently. I don't take happiness for granted. "A lot of times I talk about being sad, about having suicidal thoughts, about being manic, about all the times that I think I'm going crazy, so it inspires my work and makes me an artist with a story to tell, so I'm really grateful for having bi-polar disorder, as weird as it can seem."The positive response Khtek has received for opening up about this has been rewarding for her. In Morocco, she tells me, many people hide their mental illness and will not take their medication in public. This is because some Moroccans believe that mental illness is a kind of moral failing - you are not close enough to God."Yes, praying can help and spirituality can help. It can make you feel better. But when you have something that comes from hormones, it comes from things that are really biological in your brain. It's like having diabetes. When you have diabetes, you take meds," she says. Khtek says she was lucky to have the support of her family."If I was raised in another family maybe they will think I am possessed or something like that, they will take me to get [an] exorcism and those things can be really dangerous," she says.You can listen to DJ Edu's conversation with Khtek here, as well as his overview of the Moroccan hip-hop scene and his meeting with Moroccan rapper Dizzy DROS.	
25/11/2023 00:23:00	When this truce ends, the decisive next phase of war begins - BBC News	Israel's military campaign in Gaza City is probably in its final stages. The truce, brokered to allow for the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, will delay the IDF by anywhere from four to nine days, depending on how many hostages Hamas decides to release.When that ends, Israeli experts expect the battle for control of Gaza City to resume and last another week to 10 days.But what happens when the Israeli military turns its attention to the southern Gaza Strip, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strongly indicated?Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas wherever it exists. It assumes that the group's most important leaders, Yayha Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, are somewhere in the south, along with thousands of fighters and, probably, a significant number of Israeli hostages.If Israel decides to do to the south what it's already done to the north, will Western - especially American - goodwill start to run out?With the bulk of the Gaza Strip's estimated 2.2 million people now crammed into the southern two thirds of the Strip, many of them homeless and traumatised, is a larger humanitarian disaster looming? One of the last straws might be the sight of hundreds of Palestinian civilians, huddled in tents, amid the sandy fields of a place called al-Mawasi.According to the UN relief agency for Palestinians (Unrwa), almost 1.7 million people have been displaced across the Gaza Strip since 7 October. Most of them are in the south, living in overcrowded shelters. UN officials speak of already desperate conditions, with tens of thousands of people sheltering in schools, hospitals and, in some cases, tents. Early winter rains have already caused flooding, adding to the misery.For several weeks, Israeli officials have been talking about a solution - a so-called "safe area" at al-Mawasi, a thin strip of mainly agricultural land along the Mediterranean coast, close to the Egyptian border. Last week, leaflets dropped over the nearby city of Khan Yunis warned of impending airstrikes and told people to move west, towards the sea.In a post on social media on Thursday, Avichay Adraee, the IDF's spokesman for the Arabic media, told Gazans al-Mawasi would provide "the appropriate conditions to protect your loved ones."But how realistic is it to expect more than two million people to shelter there while the war rages nearby? And just how "appropriate" are conditions at al-Mawasi?The map shows a patchwork of fields, greenhouses and scattered houses. Although it is hard to be certain, the area defined by Israel is about 2.5km (1.6 miles) wide, at its widest, and just over 4km (2.5 miles) long.Dr Michael Milshtein, a former adviser on Palestinian affairs to Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), calls it "a beautiful and fruitful place, but quite small".Aid agencies take a less generous view."It's a tiny piece of land," Juliette Touma, director of communications for Unrwa, says. "There's nothing there. It's just sand dunes and palm trees."Any attempt to accommodate hundreds of thousands of displaced people, in an area seemingly lacking in essential infrastructure - there are no hospitals - will present the UN with a mammoth humanitarian challenge, including the setting up of emergency shelter, most likely tents.It is also a moral challenge with deep historical resonance - much of Gaza's population is descended from refugees who lived in tents after their expulsion from Israel in 1948. The Gaza Strip is already home to eight refugee camps, which have evolved over the decades into bustling, overcrowded towns. The UN doesn't want to be responsible for setting up yet another camp.Israeli officials say it will be up to aid agencies to make sure help reaches al-Mawasi from the Rafah crossing, more than 10km away. They haven't said how this will work in practice.US officials are said to be trying to negotiate with Israel over additional safe areas, possibly including one at Dahaniya, at the far southern tip of the Gaza Strip.Under the terms of the hostage release agreement, which came into effect on Friday, Israel should also allow 200 trucks of aid into Gaza each day, much more than in recent weeks. But on 16 November, a statement by the heads of 18 UN agencies and NGOs involved in providing assistance to Palestinian civilians appeared to reject Israel's plans outright."We will not participate in the establishment of any 'safe zone' in Gaza that is set up without the agreement of all the parties," it said. UN officials say the parties include Israel, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank.Without mentioning al-Mawasi by name, the 16 November statement warned that Israel's unilateral proposals could put many lives at risk.One of the signatories, Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation, called the plans "a recipe for disaster"."Attempting to cram so many people into such a small area with such little infrastructure or services," he said, "will significantly increase risks to health for people who are already on the brink."Israeli officials say Hamas is to blame and seem unfazed by the dangers. Al-Mawasi, they say, is the one area Israeli forces have undertaken not to attack."It's going to be dire. But they'll live," says Lt Col Richard Hecht, an IDF spokesman.For Israel, it's a matter of military necessity. Just as Hamas was embedded in Gaza City, it says, so the group's fighters and infrastructure exist in Khan Yunis and Rafah. Removing the civilian population ahead of an assault, Israelis argue, is the humane way to approach the job of defeating Hamas."People in Israel don't like the situation where people in Gaza are somewhere in al-Mawasi, under the rain of winter, which is coming," says retired Maj Gen Yaacov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser. "But what is the alternative? If someone has an idea how to destroy Hamas without it, please tell us."The prospect of further months of suffering, compounded by extreme overcrowding and harsh winter conditions, is bound to add to mounting international disquiet over the conduct of Israel's military campaign in Gaza."Conducting a new major ground operation in that area risks casualties and displacement of civilians on a scale which will threaten to undermine international sympathy for Israel," a Western official told me, speaking on strict condition of anonymity.'It's a question of how long Western patience will last."The Netanyahu government knows that it can count on unprecedentedly deep reserves of Western goodwill, following the unspeakable horrors perpetrated by Hamas on 7 October. But Israeli officials also know those reserves are not endless and that international calls for restraint are likely to become louder when the hostage truce comes to an end and Israel resumes its military campaign."My hope is that international pressure after the truce is ended will not prevent that," says Dr Eyal Hulata, who led Israel's National Security Council from 2021 to 2023."My hope is that the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu will not cave to pressure with this. This is what the citizens of Israel expect of their leaders."With winter looming, Israel gearing up for the decisive next phase of its campaign, and no agreement on how to deal with the civilian population, Gaza's long agony looks set to continue. Perhaps even to get worse.	
24/11/2023 19:32:00	Israel releases 39 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons - BBC News	A total of 39 Palestinian detainees have been released from Israeli prisons in exchange for a group of hostages held by Hamas.The deal - mediated by Qatar - includes a four-day pause in the fighting.They are accused of a range of offences, from throwing stones to attempted murder. Some were convicted while others were awaiting trial.The group of 24 women and 15 teenage boys was released across the Beituniya checkpoint in the occupied West Bank.They will then be allowed to return home, according to Israel's prison service.The detainees were chosen from a list of 300 women and minors compiled by Israel.Less than a quarter of those on the list have been convicted - the vast majority are being held on remand while awaiting trial. Most of those listed are teenage boys - 40% of them under the age of 18. There is also one teenage girl and 32 women.Earlier, the road by Beituniya checkpoint, near Ramallah, was sharp with the smell of tear gas. Groups of Palestinian men and boys faced the Israeli army lining up on the road ahead. The army fired rubber bullets and tear gas towards the crowd, to push them back. Some of the young people gathered threw stones and tear gas canisters back towards the troops. "It's a sign of hope for Palestinians and Israelis that the ceasefire will continue and the killing will stop," Mohammed Khatib, who was in the crowd, told the BBC.Upon the prisoners' release, the bus that transported them inched its way through a sea of jubilant Palestinian supporters. Through the windows, some of the prisoners could be seen dancing, one wrapped in a Palestinian flag. Outside, mobile phones were raised to the glass amid ululations and shouts of welcome and "God is great". A few in the crowd waved Hamas flags, but others spoke of Palestinian unity, a small moment of victory in the midst of a gruelling war. For Israel, the released prisoners are a security threat; for the Palestinians gathered here to greet them, they are victims of Israel's occupation - and their release is a symbol. Thirteen Israeli hostages were released by Hamas under the truce deal. It was confirmed on Friday that they had arrived back in Israel.  The Thai prime minister says that a group of Thai nationals held hostage by Hamas in Gaza were also released - separate from the Qatar-mediated truce deal. Israel and Hamas reached a deal earlier this week to release 50 of the hostages held in Gaza during four-day pause in fighting.The agreement should see a total of 150 Palestinians held in Israeli jails released and a significant increase in humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza. Some 60 lorries carrying medical supplies, fuel and food entered from Egypt on Friday.Hamas took more than 200 hostages during a cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed.Human rights organisations say the number of Palestinians held without charge in Israeli jails has shot up since the 7 October attacks.There are now thought to be more than 6,000 Palestinians held by Israel on security grounds - many still awaiting trial.Almost every Palestinian family in the West Bank is thought to have had a relative detained by Israel at some point in the past - often in jails inside Israel, making it difficult or impossible for their relatives to visit.	
24/11/2023 15:36:00	David Cameron warns Israel over Gaza civilian casualties - BBC News	Lord Cameron has warned Israel that it will never be secure unless there is "long-term safety, security and stability" for the Palestinian people.In his first full interview as foreign secretary, he welcomed Friday's pause in the fighting to get hostages out of Gaza and humanitarian aid in. But he told the BBC that civilian casualties in Gaza were too high.He also said that Israeli forces must abide by international humanitarian law.Lord Cameron urged Israel to crack down on what he called "completely unacceptable" violence by settlers in the occupied West Bank.It was important for Israel to realise, he said, that "it must act in a way that delivers its long-term security" and he said that would ultimately depend on "Palestinians living in peace and stability and security in this land at the same time".He also said that getting Arab countries involved in working for a future for the Palestinian people that gave them some kind of security was "a very big part of the picture". Lord Cameron was speaking on the day he visited Ramallah in the West Bank where he met Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority and other senior Palestinian leaders. He announced the UK would give a further £30m in humanitarian aid to the United Nations and other agencies on the ground in Gaza, mainly shelters, blanket, food and medicine.  He said Israel had a right to self-defence and what happened on 7 October was "completely appalling", but he added: "When I met the Israeli president, prime minister and others, I stressed over and over again that they must abide by international humanitarian law, that the number of casualties are too high and they have to have that at the top of their minds." He said he would have a "continuous dialogue" with Israel about this and also the rising settler violence in the West Bank. "People are actually targeting and on occasion killing Palestinian civilians, it's completely unacceptable and those people responsible for that, it's not good enough just to arrest them, they need to be arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned. These are crimes."Lord Cameron said he had come to Israel to talk to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other leaders about the future. "There won't be long term safety and security and stability for Israel, unless there is long term safety, security and stability for the Palestinian people," he said. "And you have to start thinking about the future…you've got to paint a picture of Palestinians living in peace and stability." He added: "You've got to think about what will happen in Gaza after this conflict has finished and how is that going to be stabilised? How is that going to be secure? How's it going to be governed. "And then you've got to think about how you start to build the capacity for there to be a state in which Palestinians can live in stability and security, that, of course, that's difficult. But you have to try."

It added: "Access to adequate and timely legal representation was frequently denied, with reports of coerced confessions, which may have been obtained as a result of torture."The protests against Iran's clerical establishment erupted in September 2022 following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly wearing her hijab "improperly".Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands detained in a violent crackdown by security forces, which have portrayed the protests as "riots".Two informed sources told BBC Persian that Milad Zohrevand was executed at Hamadan Central Prison at dawn on Thursday. But prison authorities had not handed over his body to his family by the afternoon, they said.Hengaw, which focuses on Iran's Kurdish ethnic minority, said in a statement that Zohrevand had also not been notified that his execution was imminent or granted a final meeting with his family.It strongly condemned the execution, which it said "not only violates the right to life but also egregiously infringes upon the human rights of the detainee and his family".Hengaw also alleged that the Revolutionary Guards - a major military, political and economic force in Iran - had put pressure on authorities to carry out the execution.It said this had happened without the explicit consent of the family of the officer whom Zohrevand was alleged to have killed.Last week, Hamadan's prosecutor said a branch of the Supreme Court had confirmed the death sentence handed to a defendant convicted of the murder of Ali Nazari, a member of the Revolutionary Guards' intelligence service. They did not identify the defendant, but legal collective Dadban cited sources as saying that it was Zohrevand. It also reported that his family had been pressured into not publicising his case.Zohrevand was reportedly accused by prosecutors of being one of a group of five masked men who shot Nazari as he confronted students demonstrating at the Malayer Faculty of Medical Sciences in October 2022.Iran is second only to China in the number of executions carried out annually.The UN secretary general's report said Iran was carrying out executions "at an alarming rate", putting to death at least 419 people in the first seven months of the year. That is a 30% increase compared to the same period in 2022.	
23/11/2023 18:29:00	Allow more aid into Gaza, Lord Cameron urges Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel - BBC News	Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron has urged Israel to allow more aid into Gaza to show the Palestinian people and the world that the West wants to help. He also said all possible precautions should be taken to minimise civilian casualties.  Lord Cameron had talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog. He arrived amid uncertainty about when a pause in the fighting in Gaza, agreed with Hamas, would take effect.  Qatar said the truce, aimed at allowing some of the hostages held by Hamas and some Palestinians held in Israeli jails to be freed, would now begin on Friday morning. Humanitarian aid would start being delivered to Palestinian civilians in Gaza as soon as possible after the fighting stopped, a Qatari foreign ministry spokesman added. A four-day halt in the conflict had been due to come into force on Thursday morning, but was delayed.  The foreign secretary, who made a surprise return to government last week, said he hoped it could be an "opportunity to crucially get hostages out and get aid into Gaza". Earlier, Lord Cameron visited Kibbutz Be'eri, the scene of one of the worst Hamas attacks on Israel which triggered the war on 7 October. Around 100 Israelis were killed, many of them women and children.He said: "I wanted to come here to see it for myself; I have heard and seen things I will never forget." As he met Mr Netanyahu in Jerusalem, he added: "There is never any excuse for this sort of hostage-taking."All the hostages should be released, but I hope that everyone who is responsible and behind this agreement can make it happen, to bring relief to those families, including, of course, there are British nationals who have been taken hostage."But as well as expressing support and solidarity, the foreign secretary also called on Israel to minimise civilian casualties and get more humanitarian aid into Gaza."It is vitally important that we demonstrate to the Palestinian people, to the world, that we want to help. Those people need food, they need water, they need medicine," he said.  A defiant Mr Netanyahu pledged: "We will continue with the goals of the war and to destroy Hamas, because Hamas has already promised that they will do the same thing again and again and again."There is no hope for peace between Israel and the Palestinians and between Israel and the Arab countries if we do not eradicate this murderous movement, which threatens the future of all of us," he told the foreign secretary.Until the pause comes into force, Israel has said it will continue to target Hamas. Under the deal agreed, 50 hostages seized by Hamas last month would be released, along with more than a hundred Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails.Meeting Mr Herzog, Lord Cameron spoke of a "huge amount of trauma in Israel because of the taking of 244 hostages".He said he remembered "the worst days of being prime minister was when British hostages were taken in Syria, and so many of them lost their lives in the most gruesome, terrible fashion".He added: "I remember the effect that had on me as prime minister and thinking about that, and so perhaps know a tiny bit of what your nation is going through."On Wednesday, Lord Cameron met foreign ministers from Arab and Islamic countries - including the Palestinian Authority - at Lancaster House in London to discuss the crisis.Counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia and Nigeria were there, as well as the secretary general of the League of Arab States and the ambassador of Qatar. The foreign secretary said the group discussed how to use the planned pause in the fighting to consider "how we can build a peaceful future which provides security for Israel but also peace and stability for the Palestinian people".Amnesty International UK's chief executive Sacha Deshmukh said "short pauses" were "not enough", and Lord Cameron should back a full ceasefire "in the interests of averting further civilian suffering for Palestinians and Israelis". "With the horrifying civilian death toll from Israeli attacks in Gaza still rising and no permanent ceasefire in sight, it's vital that David Cameron uses this trip to signal an urgently needed change of direction from the UK Government in support of humanity and international law," he added.The Hamas attacks in Israel last month killed some 1,200 people and saw about 240 taken hostage.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said more than 14,000 people have been killed in Israel's retaliatory campaign.	
23/11/2023 17:54:00	What we know about Israel-Hamas Gaza deal on hostages - BBC News	Israel and Hamas have reached a deal to exchange 50 of the hostages held in Gaza for a four-day pause in fighting.The agreement should also see 150 Palestinians held in Israeli jails released and a significant increase in humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza. Mediator Qatar has said the pause will start at 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Friday and the first group of 13 hostages will be released at 16:00.The US president has said the deal will end the hostages' "unspeakable ordeal" and "alleviate the suffering of innocent Palestinian families".The Israeli government has vowed to complete its war to eliminate Hamas and return the rest of the more than 200 hostages who Hamas gunmen kidnapped during a cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed.Hamas - which Israel, the US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation - has said the deal will give Palestinians time to recover after an intense Israeli air and ground assault which its government in Gaza has said has killed more than 14,500 people. Their names have not been published, but we do know that they will all be women and children.After Israel's coalition government signed off on this deal early on Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement that "at least 50 hostages - women and children - will be released over four days, during which a pause in the fighting will be held".It also offered Hamas an incentive to release more, saying: "The release of every additional 10 hostages will result in one additional day in the pause."That clause is important for the hostages' families, some of whom had previously told the BBC that they did not want to see a partial deal. The 50 hostages, expected to be released in four batches, will be Israeli nationals or dual nationals, rather than foreigners. A spokesman for Qatar's foreign ministry told reporters in Doha on Thursday afternoon that the first group of hostages to be released on Friday would comprise 13 children and women, some of them elderly. "Hostages from the same family will be put together in the same batch," Majid al-Ansari noted.He also said a list of names for the first group had been handed to Israel's Mossad intelligence agency to facilitate the implementation of the deal.Mr Netanyahu's office later confirmed that officials were "checking the details of the list and are currently in contact with all of the families".A senior US official said on Wednesday that at least three American citizens - including three-year-old Avigail Idan, an Israeli dual national whose parents were killed in Kibbutz Kfar Aza - would be among the 50 hostages.A senior Israeli official said on Tuesday afternoon that Hamas could also unilaterally release the 26 Thai nationals believed to be among the hostages. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been designated to receive the hostages in Gaza, as its staff did when Hamas freed two Israeli-American women and two Israeli women last month. On Wednesday night, Mr Netanyahu quoted the agreement as saying that the ICRC would also "be allowed to visit the remainder of the hostages and to give them required medications". However, Mr Ansari was unable to disclose whether that was the case.Israeli forces operating inside Gaza have also rescued one female soldier and recovered the bodies of two other female hostages - a soldier and a civilian.The Israeli government said it would "continue the war in order to return home all of the hostages, complete the elimination of Hamas and ensure that there will be no new threat to the State of Israel from Gaza".A longer Hamas statement issued on Wednesday morning gave more details of what Israeli military action was expected to cease for the duration of what it called a "hudna", or temporary truce.  It said all drone and Israeli aircraft activity was expected to stop for four days in the south of Gaza. But in the north - which has been the main target of Israeli operations to dismantle Hamas - the same will only hold between 10:00 and 16:00 local time (08:00-14:00 GMT) each day.Israeli troops and tanks are expected to remain in their positions inside Gaza during the four-day pause, but the Hamas statement said Israeli forces would not attack or arrest anyone.Mr Ansari said there would be "a comprehensive ceasefire" in the north and south, while Qatar's chief negotiator, Minister of State Mohammed al-Khulaifi, told Reuters news agency that there would be "no attack whatsoever, no military movements, no expansion, nothing".                 For Palestinians in Gaza, 1.7 million of whom have fled their homes according to the UN, a respite in the brutal fighting cannot come soon enough.The deal will allow 200 lorries carrying aid, four fuel tankers and four lorries carrying cooking gas to enter Gaza via Egypt's Rafah crossing on each of the four days. But it is understood that the boost in fuel - desperately needed for hospital generators, water desalination and sewage facilities - will only last for as long as the pause. Mr Ansari said the additional aid would start going into Gaza as soon as possible after the pause began on Friday morning and there was a period of calm that made it safe for humanitarian workers.Israel cut off electricity and most water, and stopped deliveries of food, fuel and other goods to Gaza in retaliation for Hamas's attack. It allowed 1,399 lorryloads of humanitarian supplies to enter via Egypt between 21 October and 21 November, compared to a monthly average of 10,000 before the war, according to the UN. It blocked all fuel deliveries until last week, saying it could be stolen by Hamas and used for military purposes.And although the deal will allow people in Gaza safe passage from north to south, it will not permit the hundreds of thousands of displaced people from the north to return home.Hamas said that the deal would also see 150 Palestinian prisoners - all women and children - released by Israel. The Israeli government statement did not mention that, but on Wednesday morning its justice ministry published a list in Hebrew of the names of 300 prisoners eligible for release as part of the deal - based on the possibility that Hamas will agree to free 50 more hostages.The list comprises 123 boys aged between 14 and 17, one 15-year-old girl, 144 18-year-old men, and 32 women aged between 18 and 59. Most are remanded in custody while awaiting trial on charges that range from stone-throwing to attempted murder. The reason the list had to be published is because of a legal formality in Israel. Ahead of any prisoner release, Israeli citizens must be allowed 24 hours to make an appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court. Mr Ansari said Qatar could not disclose any details about the Palestinian prisoners or how many would be freed on the first day. But he did suggest that the releases would happen at the same time as those of the hostages in Gaza. Israel is currently holding about 7,000 Palestinians accused or convicted of security offences, according to Israeli and Palestinian rights groups. Almost 3,000 Palestinians are reported to have been arrested in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, where violence has also surged, since 7 October.   Hamas's statement ended by saying the deal aimed to "serve our people and strengthen their steadfastness in the face of aggression".It also warned: "Our fingers remain on the trigger, and our victorious fighters will remain on the look out to defend our people and defeat the occupation."Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman said an operations room in Doha would maintain real-time lines of communication with Israel, the Hamas political office, and the ICRC, so that any possible breach is "communicated immediately to both sides and there is a way to walk back from it".The most important thing was to "make sure that the environment in which the hostage transfer will happen will be a safe one", he added.Mr Ansari said Qatar hoped to extend the temporary truce beyond the initial four days by securing the release of more hostages. He also expressed hope that it would serve as a "proof of concept for further de-escalation measures... and a more sustainable truce in Gaza".	
23/11/2023 17:15:00	Israel-Gaza war: Hamas hostage's family not expecting release - BBC News	The family of Irish-Israeli girl Emily Hand do not expect her to be among the first group of Israeli hostages to be released by Hamas.A spokesperson for Tom Hand, the father of nine-year-old Emily, told Irish broadcaster RTÉ that she is not on the list of 13 people expected to be released on Friday.The family have no information about future lists, the spokesperson added.Israel and Hamas have reached a deal to exchange 50 of the hostages - all of them women and children - held in Gaza for a four-day pause in fighting.Emily Hand’s Dublin-born father Tom was initially informed that his daughter was among a group of people killed in an attack on a kibbutz on 7 October.The Irish embassy in Israel later confirmed to RTÉ that Emily was believed to have been abducted rather than killed.Emily was in Kibbutz Be'eri, about three miles from Gaza, when Hamas launched its attack.More than 100 people were killed in the kibbutz.Israel began attacking Gaza after Hamas fighters crossed the border on 7 October, killing 1,200 Israelis and taking more than 200 hostages.Since the Hamas attacks of 7 October, Israel has been carrying out military action in Gaza.The agreement to exchange 50 of the hostages should also see 150 Palestinian women and teenagers held in Israeli jails released and an increase in humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza.Mediator Qatar said the pause would start at 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Friday and the first group of 13 hostages would be released about 16:00.	
23/11/2023 15:43:00	Gaza war: Father of twins killed in Hamas attack says he is broken by deaths - BBC News	For the father of 12-year-old twins Yannai and Liel Hetzroni-Heller the last few weeks have been filled with agonising waits and devastating news.It was nearly six weeks after the attacks by Hamas in Israel before Gavin Heller, from London, had confirmation that both his children had been killed.The twins were killed at Kibbutz Be'eri with their great-aunt and grandfather.Mr Heller said so little was found of Liel's body that some of her toys were buried at a ceremony instead."I don't even know how to put this into words," he told the BBC. "They just found remnants of Liel... initially they didn't have enough pieces to make a formal identification. They identified her literally by sieving the remnants. This will unfortunately live with me for the rest of my life."Israeli media has reported the children, who were British-Israeli, were held hostage by Hamas gunmen in a building that caught fire during a stand-off with Israeli forces.His daughter was finally identified just five days ago, with the help of forensic archaeologists. "I was literally inconsolable with grief, not finding her body and at least having something to bury."The children's great-aunt, who helped raise them after their mother suffered brain damage giving birth, and their grandfather were also murdered. Mr Heller believes they were killed for just one reason."It's something that is such a shock that people can do this to other human beings just because they were Jewish. "There was no other reason why these Hamas terrorists came in the kibbutz other than to kill, murder, maim Jewish children, babies, parents and old people all because they lived in the Jewish homeland."Mr Heller says Liel was "a bundle of energy, an extrovert. She loved to perform. She was like a princess. She was very popular and liked to be the centre of attention."He said Yannai was a very sporty child who loved tennis, football and basketball."He had a shyness about him that I think everyone respected... he was a lovely boy who was really coming into his own in terms of his character and personality."He mourns the life the twins will not now have."They really loved each other and unfortunately they will never be able to live their life to do what they wanted to do in the future and that really is a crying shame, an absolute tragedy... I won't watch them grow up, I will never see them get married, I will never see the flourish as normal teenagers would."Mr Heller, who lives in the UK, recalled the agony of not knowing what had happened to his children for weeks after the attack on 7 October."It was just an utter sense of fear, terror... not knowing whether they were hostages in Gaza. The worst thing is I wasn't able to protect them... and being in London not knowing where they were. It was agonising, absolutely agonising."Before the attack occurred, Mr Heller had been due to visit his children in October. Liel, he said, had asked him to bring her some perfume."I have lost both my children who I cared for deeply and loved."There were 1,200 Israelis killed by Hamas on 7 October and more than 200 still being held hostage in Gaza.Mr Heller has one wish. "Something of this magnitude should never happen again. The world must come together and ensure this awful atrocity should never happen, ever, ever again."	
23/11/2023 14:52:00	Israeli forces detain director of Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital - BBC News	Israeli forces have detained the director of Gaza City's al-Shifa Hospital for questioning, a week after their controversial raid there.Dr Mohammed Abu Salmiya was held at a checkpoint as he evacuated patients to the south, a colleague told the BBC.The Israeli military said he was being questioned over evidence that al-Shifa "served as a Hamas command and control centre". He and Hamas have denied that.Meanwhile, heavy fire was reported around another hospital in the north.A doctor at the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia said Israeli troops had also ordered its full evacuation. The Israeli military said it was checking the reports.Israel launched a major military campaign in the Gaza Strip with the objective of destroying Hamas - which it classes as a terrorist organisation - in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,500 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since the Israeli air and ground strikes began, while the United Nations has warned of a humanitarian crisis. On Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to exchange 50 of the hostages - all children and women - for a four-day pause in the fighting. Mediator Qatar says the truce will start at 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Friday, with the first group of 13 hostages to be released at 16:00. About 250 patients and staff members are estimated to remain at al-Shifa, which is the biggest medical facility in Gaza but is no longer operational.On Wednesday, 190 wounded and sick people, their companions, and a number of medical teams were evacuated from the hospital in an ambulance convoy to the south, in co-ordination with the World Health Organization and other humanitarian agencies, according to the United Nations.The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said in a statement overnight that the evacuation process lasted for almost 20 hours "as the convoy was obstructed and subjected to careful inspection while passing through the checkpoint" on Salah al-Din Road that separates northern and southern Gaza. "Furthermore, three paramedics and a companion of a wounded person were detained. The latter and two paramedics were later released, while the third paramedic, colleague Awni Khattab, is still detained until this moment."Neither the UN or PRCS mentioned Dr Abu Salmiya. But the head of orthopaedics at al-Shifa, Dr Adnan al-Bursh, told the BBC he had also been detained while accompanying the evacuated patients on Wednesday.On Thursday afternoon, the Israeli military confirmed that Dr Abu Salmiya had been taken for questioning by the Shin Bet internal security agency, "following evidence showing that al-Shifa Hospital, under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control centre"."The Hamas terror tunnel network situated under the hospital also exploited electricity and resources taken from the hospital. In addition, Hamas stored numerous weapons inside the hospital and on the hospital grounds."Furthermore, after the Hamas massacre on 7 October, Hamas terrorists sought refuge within the hospital, some of them taking hostages from Israel with them," it added, also alleging that a female soldier who had been taken hostage was murdered on the premises.Hamas has repeatedly denied that the hospital was used as a shelter by fighters, as have hospital staff and health ministry officials. Hamas has also claimed the soldier was killed in an Israeli air strike.On Wednesday, the Israeli military showed embedded journalists what it said was further evidence of a Hamas "terror tunnel complex" beneath al-Shifa.  A Reuters news agency reporter said he had accessed a reinforced underground tunnel through an outdoor shaft in the hospital's grounds. The tunnel led to a series of rooms, including a bathroom, kitchen and an air conditioned meeting room that the military said was used by Hamas commanders, he added.Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. This protection extends to patients, as well as to medical staff and ambulances.However, hospitals can lose their protection if they are used by a party to the conflict to commit an "act harmful to the enemy". In a separate development on Thursday, a senior doctor and a health ministry official said Israeli troops had ordered the full evacuation of the Indonesian Hospital, outside which fighting has been raging in recent days.The Indonesian Hospital's medical director, Dr Marwan Sultan, told the BBC the situation inside was "very difficult", with "heavy firing continuing around the hospital, from tanks, every 15 minutes"."We cannot stay in rooms, as the windows are being hit," he said. "We are staying in corridors in the hospital. My office was targeted several times."   "We are currently 10 medical professionals and 200 patients. No Israeli soldiers are currently inside the hospital, but we expect the same scenario as al-Shifa to happen unless the truce takes place," he added."We asked Gaza's health ministry for three buses today to evacuate the Indonesian Hospital, and we asked also for 13 ambulances for patients who cannot be seated. They are liaising with the Red Cross." The Israeli military said on Thursday morning that its troops were "striking terror targets" in the Jabalia area, which is just to the south of the hospital. On Monday, the health ministry said 12 patients and other civilians at the hospital had been killed by Israeli fire. The Israeli military said its troops had targeted "terrorists" who opened fire at them from inside the facility. Deadly Israeli strikes were also reported in the north of Gaza on Thursday, as well as in the southern city of Khan Younis.	
23/11/2023 10:59:00	Palestinian-Americans struggle with survivors' guilt - BBC News	For many Palestinian-Americans living thousands of miles away from Gaza but watching the deadly violence from afar, it's more than grief that grips them - it's also guilt.  "I think guilt is a feeling that a lot of Palestinians in the diaspora feel because every single Palestinian has Palestine in their heart, no matter where we live," says Anees, a Palestinian-American musician who lives in Virginia.  The 31-year-old has a huge Instagram following of 1.7 million people, and since the start of the Israel-Gaza war has used his platform to post about the war and call for a ceasefire."When we see the devastation, when we see the killings, I think inherently we feel this guilt that it could have been us," he says.Since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 people hostage, the Israeli military has responded with a heavy bombing campaign which it says is aimed at Hamas but which the UN says is "wiping out whole families and entire neighbourhoods". More than 14,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Palestinian-Americans who spoke to the BBC say watching what's happening in Gaza unfold on social media feeds and TV screens has been emotionally debilitating. "Everything I enjoy - every little thing - from the smallest to the biggest joy, my second thought is [Palestinians in Gaza] don't get to enjoy this," says Anees."I'm still able to go with safety to the grocery store without being bombed. I'm still able to go out to dinner without being bombed."In the minds of many Palestinian-Americans, the answers for how and why they're in the US only add to the complexity of emotions - many are the children and grandchildren of Palestinians who fled previous wars.Jinan Deena, born in Ohio and one of seven million Palestinians around the world, says her grandmother was one of up to 750,000 Palestinians who fled or were forced out of their homes at gunpoint in the war that followed Israel's creation in 1948. This violent displacement is what Palestinians today call al Nakba, or "the Catastrophe", and it pushed Jinan's grandparents to want to leave, she says.Her family first resettled in the West Bank, where Jinan's mother was born, before coming to the US in 1981. "Sometimes I wonder what if my mom stayed, and I was born and raised there?" Jinan, 41, spent many summers in the West Bank and lived there for two years as a teenager. But her family eventually returned to the US because "it just wasn't easy for us to go from living in America to living under occupation".The presence of Israeli military tanks and checkpoints, tear gas and rubber bullets was too much, she says."I look back at us leaving, and I'm like, 'Was that a cowardly thing to do? What makes me better than them?' Palestinian guilt has different levels to it."The US sends Israel billions of dollars in military aid every year, and a bill is making its way through Congress which would send more. "I also feel guilty as an American, because my tax money is going to fund this huge war," says Jinan.The rising death toll has intensified the emotional distress of Palestinian Americans. At least 5,600 children in Gaza have died since 7 October, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And the number grows each day, "becoming a graveyard for children", according to the UN. "I feel helpless, and I feel hopeless," says Jinan. "I find joy in absolutely nothing."Feelings of guilt are also amplified by news of living conditions on the ground. Residents of Gaza have had their access to water cut off by Israeli blockades, and are facing food and water shortages and disease. Some residents of Gaza have told the BBC that they have been driven to drink sea water."I was running water into a massive pot to boil potatoes and I just broke down crying," Marcelle Afram recalls."Here I am just being able to turn on the faucet and literally pour more water into one pot to boil potatoes than one person in Gaza is able to have in an entire week right now."Marcelle, a food catering business owner in Washington DC, says feelings of guilt have moved him to turn down work that isn't related to fundraising for Palestinian causes."If I don't use everything at my disposal to help, I will have to live with that for the rest of my life." It's a sentiment echoed by Anees, who says he only uses his platform now to speak about the war.Stephanie, an administrator of a Facebook group for Palestinians, says she feels similarly. She asked that we not use her last name, saying she has received threatening messages on Facebook since becoming more vocally pro-Palestinian.Pregnant with her first child, intense nausea and fatigue kept her on the sidelines during some of the initial protests in Boston. Instead, she says she tried to be an "activist at home" and made calls to her state representatives urging for a ceasefire."I would feel bad. Part of me was like, 'People are dying, and you feel sick and you're going to stay home?'"Eventually, she says her feeling of "personal responsibility" outweighed the discomforts of her pregnancy.She attended a pro-Palestine rally in Boston on 22 October, the biggest she had ever been to in her life.It was moving, and it made her feel something else she said she hadn't in a while - hopeful."It made me feel like maybe we could make a difference."	
24/11/2023 23:00:00	Israel Gaza live news: Freed hostages named as they arrive in Israel - BBC News		
23/11/2023 02:25:00	Gaza hostages deal: 'Until I see them with my own eyes I won't believe anything' - BBC News	Hen Avigdori is a well-known Israeli television comedy writer who says his mission has always been to make people laugh. But for the past 48 days, that has changed to a campaign to get "my girls back."The last contact he had with his family - wife Sharon, who's 52, and their 12-year old daughter, Noam - was on 7 October, at 10am, when they said they were going to the safe room and everything was going to be okay.  "They had gone to visit a very peaceful kibbutz in the south of Israel. Nothing would have prepared us for the awful situation that followed," says Hen."We were all supposed to go to Kibbutz Be'eri to visit my wife's brother, but at the last minute the boys decided to stay at home and the girls went away. The next thing we knew there was a big mess in the south, and they were declared as missing - for the first two weeks - and then we got the 'kidnapped' status."For Hen Avigdori's family and the vast majority of the hostages, there has been no proof of life. With a hostage release deal announced on Wednesday, he is hopeful that his wife and daughter will be among those released."Hope has been the only thing that kept us going over the past 48 days," he says. "But I am also very cautious, I don't get my hope too high. As I explained to my 16-year-old son and all the family, till the day I see the girls with my own two eyes, we won't believe anything." Hen says he has been trying not to think about the conditions in which they're being kept. Hamas says it has hidden the hostages in "safe places and tunnels" within Gaza. "I try not to imagine," he says, "I try not to think about that because I have a mission and the mission is to get them out. The more I think about their condition, the more depressed I get."Meanwhile Hen has met senior figures in the Israeli government, the Red Cross, and what he calls a "very senior member of the Qatari negotiating team".And, he says, he has put a lot of pressure on the Israeli government to prioritise hostage release over military victory. On Monday, during a heated debate between Israeli politicians and the family members in the Israeli Knesset, Hen pleaded with parliament members to "stop talking about killing Arabs and start talking about saving Jews."Hen says he always believed that in the end there was no way to get his family out without a deal. A military option to get 240 people out of Gaza is not feasible, he believes. But he adds that "there'll be no good feeling about the deal even after all the hostages are released, until Hamas feels the Israeli boots on the ground." Hen says that it means "bringing an end to the existence of Hamas and releasing every single hostage from captivity are interlinked."Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, is an American-Israeli citizen who has been missing since Hamas's attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz. His father, Jonathan, says the deal might be seen as a sign of things to come, but, like Hen, he says he will only believe it when he sees the first group of hostages cross into Israel. "My son is a peace-loving civilian who has two daughters and his wife is eight months pregnant. I, my Kibbutz Nir Oz and the whole country will of course welcome the women and children back into our community - if the deal actually happens. Up until that moment we'll be cautious, we're talking here about negotiating with a barbaric organisation."Others hostages' families expressed the same caution, that at the last minute the deal might be jeopardised by new demands.Abigail, a three-year-old Israeli-American, was taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October after both her parents were killed."We're hoping and praying that she is one of the first groups," her great aunt Liz Hirsh Naftali told CBS, the BBC's US partner. Abigail's cousin Noa Naftali added they were "cautiously hopeful, every day".The deal is only "the beginning of a journey that needs to end with the release of all of the hostages," says Ruby Chen.His son, Itay, 19, is an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier who was on active duty with a tank unit on 7 October when he was taken. After hearing the news of the deal, Ruby said he was joyful that the hostages, all of whom he described as "the extended new family members", would be coming home. Chen knows that his son will not be among the 50 to be released, but the deal is like "a framework", and it is in place. It can be a sign of hope for other deals to happen in the near future, he says. 	
22/11/2023 21:52:00	How the Israel-Hamas hostage deal came together - BBC News	In the days immediately after the 7 October attack on Israel, a secret cell was set up to work for the release of some 240 hostages captured by Hamas. So began an "extremely excruciating five-week process" involving four countries, co-ordination between spy masters and high stakes presidential calls, says a senior US administration official.  Israel and Hamas have now agreed that 50 Israeli women and children will be released over a four-day pause in the fighting, in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners, also women and children.As the breakthrough deal was announced, the official described to journalists how it happened.  Qatar spearheaded the effort, he said, approaching Israel and the US with a proposal to establish a cell that would work quietly and intensely on the issue. Doha acted as the main channel to Hamas, but Egypt was also part of the complex negotiating arrangement.  The first breakthrough came on 23 October, when Hamas released two American women. That was the "pilot" project, said the administration official, which "proved the concept". After that, efforts for a larger release began in earnest. Israel delegated the head of Mossad, David Barnea, as its negotiator and he regularly consulted the CIA chief Bill Burns on the contours of a deal.  The process was painfully protracted because messages had to be passed from Doha or Cairo to Hamas in Gaza and then back out again. And the talks were highly technical, painstakingly hammering out details on corridors, surveillance, timeframes and total numbers.  The administration official said President Joe Biden was "directly and personally" engaged, calling up the leaders of Israel and Qatar at critical times. Mr Biden saw a hostage deal as the "only realistic path to secure a multi-day humanitarian pause in the fighting", said the official, because the Israelis made clear they would not stop their offensive for anything else.  That calculation is part of the agreement, which offers to extend the suspension of hostilities if Hamas releases more hostages.  "We also have confidence that…as we are in the pause period, additional women and children will come out," said the US official.  One of the sticking points was a failure by Hamas to clearly identify who would be in the initial group of 50. It eventually produced the information when President Biden called the Emir of Qatar and said this was a deal breaker, said the official.  Just as they appeared to be closing in on an agreement in mid-November everything stalled, he said, because communications with Hamas "went dark". He did not elaborate, but it was also around this time that Gaza ran out of fuel.  The administration official said when communications were restored it still took time to work out gaps in the very detailed agreement because of Israel and America's high level of distrust with Hamas.  He sidestepped questions about whether the hostage deal and the negotiations channel that brokered it offered a path towards ending the war.  But he said when it came to the hostages, "what I just described for the last five weeks is not going to stop. As we go through this initial phase, we're determined to get everybody home".	
22/11/2023 15:39:00	Arnolfini gallery cancels Palestine film festival events - BBC News	An art gallery has cancelled two Palestinian film events amidst ongoing conflict in the Middle East.The Arnolfini, Bristol, withdrew its offer to host the festival over concerns it could be "construed as political activity".More than 1,500 people have signed an open letter, criticising the venue's decision.The events are still scheduled to take place elsewhere in the city. Hosted across four venues from 2 to 10 December, Bristol's Palestine Film Festival aims to celebrate Middle Eastern culture by showcasing contemporary film and arts.A screening of Farha, a coming-of-age film based on a true story, and a live poetry night headlined by rapper and activist Lowkey, were due to take place at the venue on 2 December.Arnolfini announced on 21 November the "challenging" and "difficult" decision not to host the scheduled events.In a statement released by the venue, festival organisers cited concerns that the performances and discussion panels might "stray into political activity".Organisers also said they did not have the resources to properly assess risks for the event in light of current tensions.They add they were "legally obliged" as an arts charity to follow government guidance on remaining apolitical."We shared these reasons with the Bristol Palestinian Film Festival. We understand their disappointment," the Arnolfini said in its statement."We are pleased that the events are still scheduled to take place elsewhere in the city," they added. Watershed, their partner venue, will now host the screening of Farha and the poetry event will be held at Sparks. Arnolfini has faced backlash since its announcement, with 1,574 people so far signing an open letter criticising the decision."These events were intended to explore the issue of increasing silencing and censorship of Palestinian and pro-Palestinian voices in the arts," the letter reads."We find it particularly ironic and disappointing that Arnolfini has chosen to withdraw from these events, indicating its unwillingness to take a stand against such censorship in arts and culture," it adds.Alison Sterling, member of the board of trustees for the Palestine Film Festival, said: "We'd prefer not to comment on the decision by Arnolfini at this time, in order to keep the focus on the films, the filmmakers and the people of Palestine, and to deliver a great festival for the people of Bristol."Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

21/11/2023 17:48:00	Lebanon PM says Israeli strikes killed journalists - BBC News	Four people, including two journalists, have been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon, local media say, as exchanges of fire intensify along the border.Lebanon's prime minister condemned the "attack" in the village of Tayr Harfa that killed an Al Mayadeen TV reporter and cameraman along with another man.Israel's military said it had "operated against a threat" in the same area and that it was reviewing the incident. An elderly woman was also reportedly killed in Kfarkela, to the east.Earlier, Israeli aircraft struck what the military said were "terrorist cells" in the border area as well as targets belonging to the Lebanese group Hezbollah, which has repeatedly fired missiles and mortar shells across the border since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip six weeks ago.Al Mayadeen, a Beirut-based Arabic TV channel, said its reporter Farah Omar and cameraman Rabih al-Maamari were "deliberately targeted" as they reported from Tayr Harfa, a village about 2km (1.2 miles) from the border."An Israeli warplane fired two rockets on Farah and Rabih's location," it said. "Farah and Rabih had just ended a live broadcast at 10 AM [08:00 GMT], giving updates on the latest Israeli bombardment in South Lebanon."A picture posted on social media appeared to show the journalists' bodies on the ground near a burning TV camera mounted on a tripod.Lebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) said another civilian, whom it named as Hussein Aqeel, was killed. Al Mayadeen's director, Ghassan bin Jiddo, said he was a "contributor"."This attack proves once again that there are no limits to Israeli crimes, and that its only goal is to silence the media that exposes its crimes and attacks," Lebanese Prime Minister Nabjib Mikati said, according to NNA.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that its soldiers had "operated against a threat posed from a launching area of ​​the Hezbollah terrorist organisation" in the Jibbain area, which is 1.5km east of Tayr Harfa."This is an area with active hostilities, where exchanges of fire occur. Presence in the area is dangerous. The incident is under review," it added. The IDF has previously insisted that it does not deliberately target journalists, but this would appear to be the third attack on journalists working in southern Lebanon since the start of the war.A fourth person, who NNA identified as 80-year-old Laiqa Sarhan, was killed and several family members were wounded in a strike on a village further east along the border, the aftermath of which was witnessed by a BBC team.Their house in Kfarkela was hit and badly damaged. Fire fighters from local civil defence units rushed to the scene to put out the blaze, as ambulances took the wounded family members, including children, to hospital.Earlier on Tuesday, the IDF put out a statement saying that aircraft had "struck three armed terrorist cells in the area of the border" and "a number of Hezbollah terror targets, including military infrastructure and structures used for directing terrorist activity".Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Shia Islamist group that wields considerable military and political power in Lebanon. It is considered a terrorist organisation by Israel, UK, the US and others. The deadly exchanges along the border escalated after 7 October, when Gaza-based gunmen from Hamas - another Iran-backed group that is also classed as a terrorist group by Israel and Western powers - attacked southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 240 others hostage.Israel launched a military operation to destroy Hamas in response to the attack. More than 14,000 people in Gaza have been killed, according to the Hamas-run government.Tuesday's incident in Lebanon comes almost a week after an Israeli attack hit an area in the village of Yaroun where a group of journalists was working. On 13 October, Israeli strikes killed a Reuters news agency cameraman, Issam Abdallah, and six other journalists were wounded as they reported on clashes near the border. Lebanon's public health ministry reports that at least 77 people, including combatants and civilians, have been killed due to armed clashes along the border with Israel, according to the UN. Israeli authorities say six soldiers and three civilians have been killed in northern Israel over the same period.  	
21/11/2023 16:08:00	Parents and siblings of UK woman killed in Gaza attack - BBC News	Twelve relatives of a UK woman, including her parents and four siblings, have been killed in an Israeli rocket attack in Gaza.Fatma Aljaja's nephew and nieces, brother-in-law and two sisters-in-law also died when rockets hit their apartment in Gaza City.Ms Aljaja, who left Gaza 10 years ago and now lives in Staffordshire, said the pain of losing them was "like something you can't describe".Rockets struck the home on 8 November.Her mother Noura Abu Hassira, 65, and father Ghanem Taufeek, 75, had decided not to evacuate south from their apartment, about a quarter of a mile from the Al-Shifa Hospital, because they felt there was no safe passage, she said.Thousands have been trapped at Gaza's largest hospital by nearby battles between Israeli forces and Hamas miltants. Israel says Hamas fighters have operated in tunnels underneath the hospital, a claim denied by the group, which the UK government considers a terrorist organisation.Gaza-born Ms Aljaja lives with her husband Mohammed Sheraz in Burton-upon-Trent.They learnt of their deaths when a relative called them. "It was eight o'clock on a Monday morning [and you] don't expect that phone call," said Mr Sheraz."She was shaking next to me asking 'who? who?'"I think it took me 30 seconds to a minute to let it out but obviously Fatma was completely in bits at that stage." The couple heard family members in Gaza spent the best part of three days digging the bodies out by hand."We are trying to stay strong but the burn is inside. You feel the burn inside you. I don't think this will go," Ms Aljaja said."Nobody will feel it until you lose your whole family in one second."It's something you can't describe. Some kind of pain you can't describe."She said she believed the apartment had been targeted deliberately because of her brother Mohammed's aid and journalism work. The only member of the family to survive the rocket strikes was a niece, three-year-old Hannah, who was pulled from the rubble alive. She was treated for burns and other injuries but it is not clear what has happened to her since. Mr Sheraz said they had heard she was being cared for by her grandparents somewhere in the north of Gaza. "Miraculously she survived that carnage… [but] she has lost everything," he said.Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk	
21/11/2023 07:51:00	Palestinian football's 'star defender' among players stuck in Gaza - BBC News	The rumble of continuous bombardment is a far cry from the sound of cheering fans and referees blowing their whistles - sounds that Ibrahim Abuimeir is used to. The 21-year-old is part of the Palestinian national football team along with two other players in Gaza - Ahmed Kullab and Khaled Al-Nabris. The three should have been training for the World Cup Qualifiers. The Palestinian team is due to play against Australia on Tuesday in Kuwait.But Ibrahim, Ahmed and Khaled were not able to make it to selections. They're stuck in Gaza and every day they face the threat of being killed.Ibrahim had a narrow escape. An air strike hit his neighbour's home on October 30. The impact also destroyed Ibrahim's house. Seventeen of his neighbours were killed in the attack. "We found only one of the bodies intact. The others were ripped apart. Two bodies are still under the rubble. We haven't been able to dig them out. We've had to identify people from parts of their bodies," Ibrahim told Amr Tabash, a freelance journalist working for the BBC in Gaza. "My grandparents were injured. It took us two days to pull them out."We spoke to Ahmed Kullab over the phone. "We find ourselves under a siege in a bloody conflict. The constant bombing makes life very unpredictable," he said. Ahmed's cousin was killed in an attack. Two of Ibrahim's teammates from RafaSports Club, his local team, have died. "They were sitting in their homes thinking they were safe, and they were bombed," he said.After days of trying his phone, we were able to contact Khaled who confirmed he's in Gaza, but didn't want to be interviewed. Conditions are tough. "Saltwater comes only once or twice a week. For drinking water, we currently rely on wells and water desalination using solar power," Ahmed said. Ibrahim, described by his trainers as one of the star defenders of the Palestinian team, starts his day standing in a queue for water. They say they are grateful to have survived so far, but it is a bleak life without the sport they love and which gives it meaning. "I'm heartbroken. Getting the chance to participate in the World Cup would have been significant," said Ibrahim. "Football is my whole life. No words can capture the depth of my emotions. For 44 days I haven't played, and each day gets harder than the previous one."In the grief of war, this is the heartache of losing out on an opportunity, which can be crucial in sporting careers that often have short time spans.  "Football has been a dream for me from a very young age. I was so excited that I might be called up to the first team of the Palestinian football team. I'm very sad," said Ahmed. Ibrahim says he was able to watch ten minutes of one of the matches played by the Palestinian team, and he felt both sad and proud as he watched. I met Ehab Abujazar, one of the trainers of the Palestinian national football team, in Ramallah in the West Bank. He used to be a player himself and has trained Ahmed and Ibrahim for many years. Ehab's family is in Gaza too."My father passed away on the second day of the war, from illness. Sadly I couldn't travel to Gaza to bid him farewell and see him one last time because of the conflict," he said. "Danger is ever-present in Gaza and my family are constantly moving to find safer places to take shelter."Ehab said that even before the war it was not straightforward for players in Gaza to be allowed out to play."The President of the Palestinian Football Association negotiated tirelessly with the Israeli government, and with the intervention of FIFA the process had been eased slightly," Ehab said. Ibrahim described the process. "We would leave our homes at 6am and gather at the Rafah crossing. Then we would wait in a hall on the Palestinian side for two to three hours until the paperwork was completed. Then we would pass over to the Egyptian side. "We weren't allowed to enter Egypt, but escorted to the airport and kept in a room there until it was time for our flights. Very often, we spent two days travelling," he said."It was hard, but we didn't mind as we were so preoccupied with the game," he added. With thousands killed during the war, I asked Ehab why it is important for the Palestinian team continue to play football."In times like these, it is crucial for the Palestinian team to play. It showcases our resilience, " he said. "Football is not merely a game for us; it is a method through which we strive to achieve the dream of an officially recognised state for every Palestinian."Ahmed has a similar message. "Football is powerful way to demonstrate that the Palestinian people, despite the challenges they face, are human beings, that they have ambitions, dreams and talents."Additional reporting: Amr Tabash in Gaza, Naomi Scherbel-Ball, Nathalie Jimenez and Haneen Abdeen in Jerusalem	
21/11/2023 03:47:00	Netanyahu vows 'absolute victory' over Hamas ahead of expected pause in fighting - BBC News		
21/11/2023 02:23:00	Yahya Sinwar: Who is the Hamas leader in Gaza? - BBC News	Yahya Sinwar has disappeared. Hardly surprising when thousands of Israeli troops backed by drones, electronic eavesdropping devices and human informants, are all trying to discover his whereabouts.Sinwar, who has striking snow-white hair and jet-black eyebrows, is the leader of Hamas's political wing in Gaza, and one of Israel's most wanted men. It holds him responsible along with others for the 7 October raid into southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, and more than 200 others kidnapped."Yahya Sinwar is the commander… and he is a dead man," declared the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari in early October."This abominable attack was decided upon by Yahya Sinwar," said IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. "Therefore he and all those under him are dead men walking."That includes Mohammed Deif, the elusive leader of Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades. Hugh Lovatt, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), believes Deif was the brains behind the planning of the 7 October attack because it was a military operation, but Sinwar "would likely have been part of the group that planned and influenced it".Israel believes that Sinwar, who is effectively second-in-command after Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, is cornered below ground, hiding in tunnels somewhere beneath Gaza with his bodyguards, communicating with no-one for fear that his signal will be tracked and located. Sinwar, 61, widely known as Abu Ibrahim, was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp at the southern end of the Gaza Strip. His parents were from Ashkelon but became refugees after what Palestinians call "al-Naqba" (the Catastrophe) - the mass displacement of Palestinians from their ancestral homes in Palestine in the war that followed Israel's founding in 1948. He was educated at Khan Younis Secondary School for Boys and then graduated with a bachelor's degree in Arabic language from the Islamic University of Gaza. At that time, Khan Younis was a "bastion" of support for the Muslim Brotherhood, says Ehud Yaari, a fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who interviewed Sinwar in prison four times. The Islamist group "was a massive movement for young people going to the mosques in the poverty of the refugee camp", Yaari says, and it would later take on a similar importance for Hamas.Sinwar was first arrested by Israel in 1982, aged 19, for "Islamic activities" and then arrested again in 1985. It was around this time that he won the confidence of Hamas's founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.The two became "very, very close", says Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. This relationship with the organisation's spiritual leader would later give Sinwar a "halo effect" within the movement, Michael adds.Two years after Hamas was founded in 1987, he set up the group's feared internal security organisation, the al-Majd. He was still only 25.Al-Majd became infamous for punishing those accused of so-called morality offences - Michael says he targeted shops that stocked "sex videos" - as well as hunting down and killing anyone suspected of collaborating with Israel. Yaari says he was responsible for numerous "brutal killings" of people suspected of co-operation with Israel. "Some of them with his own hands and he was proud of that, talking about it to me and to others."According to Israeli officials, he later confessed to punishing a suspected informer by getting the man's brother to bury him alive, finishing the job using a spoon instead of a spade. "He is the kind of man who can gather around him followers, fans - together with many who are simply afraid of him and don't want to pick any fights with him," Yaari says.In 1988, Sinwar allegedly planned the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers. He was arrested the same year, convicted by Israel for the murder of 12 Palestinians and given four life sentences.Sinwar has spent a large part of his adult life - over 22 years - in Israeli prisons, from 1988 to 2011. His time there, some of it in solitary confinement, appears to have radicalised him even further. "He managed to impose his authority ruthlessly, using force," says Yaari. He positioned himself as a leader among the prisoners, negotiating on their behalf with prison authorities and enforcing discipline among the inmates. An Israeli government assessment of Sinwar during his time in prison described his character as "cruel, authoritative, influential and with unusual abilities of endurance, cunning and manipulative, content with little... Keeps secrets even inside prison amongst other prisoners… Has the ability to carry crowds".Yaari's assessment of Sinwar, built up over the times they met, was that he is a psychopath. "[But] to say about Sinwar, 'Sinwar is a psychopath, full stop,' would be a mistake" he says, "because then you will miss this strange, complex figure".He is, Yaari says, "extremely cunning, shrewd - a guy who knows to switch on and off a type of personal charm".When Sinwar would tell him Israel must be destroyed and insist there was no place for Jewish people in Palestine, "he would joke, 'Maybe we'll make an exception of you'".While incarcerated Sinwar had become fluent in Hebrew, reading Israeli newspapers. Yaari says Sinwar always preferred to speak Hebrew with him, even though Yaari was fluent in Arabic. "He sought to improve his Hebrew," Yaari says. "I think he wanted to benefit from somebody who spoke higher Hebrew than the prison wardens."Sinwar was released in 2011 as part of a deal that saw 1,027 Palestinian and Israeli Arab prisoners released from jail in exchange for a single Israeli hostage, the IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. Shalit had been held captive for five years after being kidnapped by - amongst others - Sinwar's brother, who is a senior Hamas military commander. Sinwar has since called for more kidnappings of Israeli soldiers.By now, Israel had ended its occupation of the Gaza Strip and Hamas was in charge, having won an election and then eliminated its rivals, Yasser Arafat's Fatah party, by throwing many of its members off the tops of tall buildings. When Sinwar returned to Gaza, he was immediately accepted as a leader, Michael says. Much of this was to do with his prestige as a founding member of Hamas who had sacrificed so many years of his life in Israeli prisons.But also, "people just feared him - this is a person that murdered people with his hands", Michael says. "He was very brutal, aggressive and charismatic at the very same time.""He's not an orator," says Yaari. "When he speaks to the public, it's like somebody from the Mob."Yaari adds that immediately after leaving prison, Sinwar also forged an alliance with the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades and chief of staff Marwan Issa.In 2013, he was elected a member of Hamas's Political Bureau in the Gaza Strip, before becoming its head in 2017. Sinwar's younger brother Mohammed also went on to play an active role in Hamas. He claimed to have survived several Israeli assassination attempts before being pronounced dead by Hamas in 2014. Media reports have since surfaced asserting he may still be alive, active in Hamas's military wing hiding in tunnels beneath Gaza and may even have played a part in the 7 October attacks.Sinwar's reputation for ruthlessness and violence earned him the nickname of The Butcher of Khan Younis. "He's a guy who imposes brutal discipline," says Yaari, "People knew in Hamas and they still do - if you disobey Sinwar, you put your life on the line."He is reputed to have been responsible for the 2015 detention, torture and murder of a Hamas commander named Mahmoud Ishtiwi who was accused of embezzlement and homosexuality.In 2018, in a briefing to the international media, he signalled his support for thousands of Palestinians to break through the border fence separating the Gaza Strip from Israel as part of protests over the US moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Later that year he claimed to have survived an assassination attempt by Palestinians loyal to the rival Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank.Yet he has also shown periods of pragmatism, supporting temporary ceasefires with Israel, prisoner exchanges, and a reconciliation with the Palestinian Authority. He was even criticised by some opponents as too moderate, Michael says.Many in Israel's defence and security establishment believe it was a fatal mistake to have let Sinwar out of prison as part of the prisoner exchange.Israelis feel they were lulled into a false sense of security in the mistaken belief that by offering Hamas economic incentives and more work permits, the movement would have lost its appetite for war. This, of course, turned out to be a disastrous miscalculation."He sees himself as the guy destined to liberate Palestine - he's not about improving the economic situation, social services for Gaza," says Yaari. "It's not him."In 2015, the US State Department officially categorised Sinwar as a "Specially Designated Global Terrorist". In May 2021 Israeli airstrikes targeted his home and office in the Gaza Strip. In April 2022, in a televised address, he encouraged people to attack Israel by any available means.Analysts have identified him as a key figure linking Hamas's political bureau with its armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, which led the October 7th attacks in southern Israel.On 14 October, an Israeli military spokesman, Lt Col Richard Hecht, called Sinwar "the face of evil". He added: "That man and his whole team are in our sights. We will get to that man."Sinwar is also close to Iran. A partnership between a Shia country and a Sunni Arab organisation is not an obvious one, but both share a goal to end the state of Israel and "liberate" Jerusalem from Israeli occupation.They have come to work hand in hand. Iran funds, trains and arms Hamas, helping it to build up its military capabilities and amass an arsenal of thousands of rockets, which it uses to target Israeli towns. Sinwar expressed his gratitude for the support in a speech in 2021. "Had it not been for Iran, the resistance in Palestine would not have possessed its current capabilities."Yet killing Sinwar would be more of a "PR victory" for Israel than it would actually impact the movement, Lovatt says. Non-state organisations tend to operate like a hydra's head - one operational commander or figurehead leader gets removed and they are quickly replaced by another. Their successor sometimes lacks the same experience or credibility but the organisation still manages to regenerate itself in some form."Clearly, he would be a loss," says Lovatt, "but he would be replaced and there are structures in place to do that. It's not like killing Bin Laden. There are other senior political and military leaders within Hamas."Perhaps the bigger question remains this - what happens to Gaza when Israel ends its military campaign to eradicate Hamas, and who will ultimately be in charge? And can they prevent it from becoming once again a launchpad for attacks on Israel, triggering in return the kind of massive retribution and destruction we are seeing now.Additional reporting by Jon Kelly	
20/11/2023 23:46:00	Israeli tanks surround north Gaza's Indonesian Hospital - BBC News	Israeli tanks have reportedly encircled Gaza's Indonesian Hospital, where the Hamas-run health ministry said 12 people were killed on Sunday night.The hospital's director, Dr Marwan Al-Sultan, told the BBC that the post-operative care department was hit and troops were only about 20m (66ft) away.On Monday evening, he said intermittent shooting could still be heard on site.The Israeli military said its forces targeted "terrorists" who had opened fire at them from within the hospital.The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said he was "appalled". "Health workers and civilians should never have to be exposed to such horror, and especially while inside a hospital," Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.Health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra accused Israel of "tightening its noose" around the hospital in the north of the enclave, and later told AFP news agency 200 patients had been evacuated by bus to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis.He said the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was helping to coordinate the evacuation of the remaining 400 patients.Meanwhile, 28 premature Palestinian babies evacuated on Sunday from Gaza City's besieged Al-Shifa Hospital, which Israeli forces raided last week, have been transported to Egypt for treatment.Israel launched a major military campaign in Gaza in response to a cross-border attack by hundreds of Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 14,000 people have been killed in the territory since Israel launched its retaliatory campaign against Hamas. The UN Security Council has called for "urgent and extended humanitarian pauses" for "a sufficient number of days" to allow UN agencies to safely enter the sealed-off territory.But five days on, the International Rescue Committee says the killing and suffering of Palestinians has increased, and has urged the Security Council and others to bring about a ceasefire "without limits on its duration, to protect lives and allow aid to flow".On Monday morning, video footage verified by the BBC showed several tanks stationed on a road about 240m (800ft) north-east of the Indonesian Hospital, which is funded by Indonesia.The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, cited medical sources as saying that dozens of Israeli armoured vehicles were in the surrounding area and that snipers were on rooftops, preventing ambulances from reaching the hospital. The health ministry said 12 wounded patients and people with them were killed and dozens more were wounded when an Israeli shell reportedly hit the second floor of the facility.Dr Al-Sultan told the BBC that he heard gunfire all around the building overnight and that at least 10 people were killed. Al Jazeera posted a video that the Qatar-based network said showed journalist Anas al-Sharif walking through the hospital following the incident. The body of at least one person could be seen, as well as damage to ceilings and equipment in several rooms and corridors. Sharif reported that "victims are piling up on the floor" and that there was "an overwhelming state of panic among patients". Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. Any military operation around hospitals must take steps to spare patients, medical staff and other civilians inside them.A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: "Overnight, terrorists opened fire from within the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza toward IDF troops operating outside the hospital. In response, IDF troops directly targeted the specific source of enemy fire. No shells were fired toward the hospital.""Despite the challenges the IDF faces in a war against a terrorist organisation which operates out of hospitals, the IDF is committed to international law and takes numerous measures to minimize harm to non-combatants."Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden said he believed a deal to free hostages in Gaza was close, as the ICRC said its president had travelled to Qatar to meet with Hamas and Qatari government representatives.US national security spokesman John Kirby said he believed "we're closer than we've ever been, so we're hopeful". The ICRC does not take part in negotiations leading to hostage releases but is there to facilitate any deal that is agreed.That has been the process with the four hostages freed so far - Qatari negotiations with Hamas followed by the ICRC retrieving the hostages from agreed locations and bringing them back to Israel.Qatar's prime minister has said a deal to free some of the hostages now hinges on "minor" practical issues. On Sunday night, the IDF released new videos from Al-Shifa Hospital, where it has claimed there was a vast underground Hamas command centre. It said one showed a tunnel leading to a blast-proof door and that two others taken from CCTV cameras showed two hostages - one of them wounded - being taken to the hospital on 7 October. The IDF also said a pathologist's report and its intelligence had shown a female Israeli soldier whose body was recovered from a building near Al-Shifa last week had been injured in an Israeli air strike and then killed by a member of Hamas inside the hospital. Hamas has denied using Al-Shifa and other hospitals as shields for its fighters.At the same time, the WHO has said it was finalising its plans to complete the evacuation of between 250 to 260 seriously wounded or ill patients trapped at Al-Shifa."These include around 29 patients with spinal injuries, 22 patients with kidney failure requiring kidney dialysis," the WHO's Regional Emergency Director, Dr Richard Brennan, told the BBC."The vast majority of the remaining patients have complicated war injuries - terrible fractures and amputations, bad burns, head, abdominal, chest injuries, and many of which are complicated by severe wound infection."Thirty-one premature babies were evacuated from Al-Shifa to the Emirates Hospital in southern Gaza on Sunday by the Palestinian Red Crescent and UN, with the assistance of the IDF. At least five other babies had previously died after being removed from their incubators due to a lack of power after the hospital ran out of fuel.On Monday, 28 of the evacuated babies were taken to Egypt via the Rafah border crossing for treatment. Some are being admitted to the hospital in El-Arish while others in more serious conditions are being flown to Cairo.Dr Mohamed Salama, head of the neo-natal unit at al-Ahli Emirates hospital, told the BBC that the parents of two babies had refused to send them to Egypt "due to personal circumstances". A third baby was being kept in Gaza because his condition was stable and his parents were unknown, he said.Dr Brennan described the evacuation as "one of the few bits of good news we've had during this conflict", but noted that the babies had "a long road ahead of them" to recover.In a separate development, medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said its clinic in Gaza City came under fire on Monday morning."Our colleagues saw that a wall was torn down and part of the building was engulfed by fire as heavy fighting took place all around it. An Israeli tank was seen in the street," a statement said.An MSF member of staff and 20 family members were in the clinic and in extreme danger, while 50 other people were in nearby buildings, it added.There was no immediate comment from the IDF.On the Front Line: Jeremy BowenBBC News International Editor Jeremy Bowen on what it's like reporting from inside Israel and Gaza (UK only).Available now on BBC iPlayer	
20/11/2023 22:42:00	US says Israel hostage deal 'closer than ever' - BBC News	A deal to release hostages taken from Israel during Hamas's attacks last month is "closer than ever before", according to a senior US official. "We're hopeful... but there's still work to be done," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. At a separate event, US President Joe Biden also said he believed an agreement was nearing.An estimated 240 people were kidnapped in the 7 October Hamas attacks, during which 1,200 Israelis were killed.Since then, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said 13,000 people in Gaza have been killed in the territory in Israel's retaliatory campaign.Hints that a deal to secure the release of hostages may be nearing have been increasing in recent days - including from Qatar, which was instrumental in securing the release of four hostages last month.Now the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)'s president has travelled to Qatar - where hostage negotiations are being mediated and where the political leadership of Hamas is based.In a statement, the ICRC said its president, Mirjana Spoljaric, had travelled there in order to "advance humanitarian issues" related to the conflict. While the ICRC has stressed that it does not take part in direct negotiations leading to the release of hostages, it does help to facilitate releases once they have been agreed. So far, the group has facilitated the release of four hostages released by Hamas - a mother and daughter - who are US nationals - and two elderly Israeli women. "As a neutral humanitarian intermediary, we remain ready to facilitate any future release that the parties to the conflict agree to," the ICRC said.On Sunday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said that only "very minor" practical and logistical obstacles remain in the way of securing a deal.The Israeli ambassador to the US - Michael Herzog - had also waded in, saying he was hopeful a deal for the release of a significant number of hostages would be reached "in the coming days".From talking to a figure familiar with the talks recently, the BBC understands that Israel and Hamas may be looking at some kind of phased release. This could include a small number of hostages being freed initially, alongside a ceasefire. If this holds, more people could be let go. Elsewhere, it has been suggested that part of the package could be the release of some Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, possibly women and minors.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far ruled out a halt to Israel's retaliatory attacks in Gaza, saying previously he would only consider a ceasefire when all hostages were released.Its operation, which involves air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops, aims to eliminate Hamas. More than 13,000 are thought to have died so far, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.Last week Israel's military said it had found the bodies of two hostages - 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss and 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano - in the Gaza Strip.On Monday there were fraught interactions between the families of hostages and Israeli politicians.In one incident, several relatives of those held hostage in Gaza walked out of a meeting with the country's Prime Minister Netanyahu and other senior politicians after reportedly being told that securing the release was not the main priority. Udi Goren, whose cousin is among those who were kidnapped, told Israeli news organisation Channel 12 that relatives were now being told that the goal of freeing hostages was on par with destroying Hamas."It's a huge disappointment," he said. In another, which saw highly-charged scenes in the Knesset (Israel's parliament), relatives pleaded with far-right members of Israel's governing coalition not to introduce legislation to allow the use of the death penalty against Hamas, saying it could endanger hostages.Ultra-nationalist members of the knesset accused them of siding with Hamas by attempting to slow down the controversial bill. Gil Dickmann, whose aunt was killed by Hamas and whose two cousins are among the hostages, was among the relatives who took part in the confrontation. He told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme he thought the politicians had "crossed a line" with the allegation and accused far-right leader and government minister Itamar Ben-Gvir of "doing whatever to spark more and more violence, more and more hate"."Our trust in the government was lost on 7 October," Mr Dickman said. "And I think you can understand why. Our families or relatives were all hurt in a way that we couldn't imagine before."But I think that the bringing back of the kidnapped and abductees is the one thing that can bring back trust and bring back our belief in ourselves."On the Front Line: Jeremy BowenBBC News International Editor Jeremy Bowen on what it's like reporting from inside Israel and Gaza (UK only).Available now on BBC iPlayer	
20/11/2023 20:20:00	Japan condemns Yemen's Houthi rebels hijack of cargo ship in Red Sea - BBC News	Japan has condemned the hijacking of a Japanese-operated, British-owned cargo ship in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels.The Yemeni militia claimed the vessel was Israeli, and a spokesman said the seizure was only the beginning of a "battle at sea". Israel said the ship was not Israeli and a Japanese government spokesperson said it was operated by Nippon Yusen.Japan's chief cabinet secretary said it was working towards the ship's release.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed the Houthi's backer, Iran, for the hijacking.Mr Netanyahu said neither the vessel nor the crew were Israeli and called it an "Iranian attack on an international ship". Iran has denied involvement.Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen - also known as NYK Line - said the ship, named Galaxy Leader, was carrying 25 crew members when it was seized near Hodeida, Yemen on its way to India.Those on board are believed to include Bulgarian, Mexican, Filipino and Ukrainian nationals. Galaxy Leader is owned by Galaxy Maritime Ltd, which is registered in the Isle of Man. It is owned by Ray Car Carriers, which is co-owned by Israeli businessman Abraham Ungar, according to documents from the Isle of Man Government's Companies registry.In a statement quoted by Reuters news agency, Galaxy Maritime Ltd said the ship was "illegally boarded by military personnel via a helicopter" on Sunday, and was now being held at the port of Hodeidah in Yemen. Unverified video footage released by the Houthis on Monday and aired on the group's TV channel, Al Masirah, showed armed men descending from a helicopter onto the ship.Mr Ungar told The Associated Press news agency he was aware of the incident but could not comment on it. "The government of Japan absolutely condemns such an act," said Hirokazu Matsuno, Japan's chief cabinet secretary said on Monday, adding there were no Japanese nationals among the crew.He said ministries and agencies were working with the relevant countries for the early release of the vessel and its crew."We are also urging related countries such as Saudi Arabia, Oman and Iran to strongly urge the Houthis to release the ships and sailors as soon as possible."Matthew Miller, spokesman for the US state department, called the Houthi's seizure of the ship "a flagrant violation of international law" and demanded the "immediate release of the ship and its crew".Mohammed Abdulsalam, a spokesman for Yemen's Houthi rebels, said on X, formerly Twitter, the group's seizure of the vessel was only "the start" of its fighters waging "battle at sea".Houthi's military spokesman, Yahya al-Sarea, claimed the ship was Israeli and had been taken to a port in Yemen.The group had earlier threatened to target any Israeli ship within their reach in response to Israel's retaliatory military action in the Gaza Strip following the 7 October attack by Hamas militants.More than 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage during the surprise Hamas attack on the south of the country, according to the Israeli government. In retaliation, it launched a massive military operation to try and eliminate Hamas - involving air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops - with the aim of eliminating Hamas.According to the Hamas-run health ministry, the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 13,300. More than 2,000 more are feared to be buried under rubble.The Houthis have fired several missiles and drones towards Israel just after Israel launched its retaliatory operation.The US said at the time that all the missiles and drones were intercepted by its warship in the Red Sea.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described the attack on the ship as a "very grave incident of global consequence".The IDF said the vessel was on its way from Turkey to India when it was seized in the southern Red Sea near Yemen.Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has recently said that what he called resistance groups allied to Tehran were "cleverly adjusting pressure" on Israel and its supporters.Earlier this month, the Houthis shot down a US military drone off Yemen's coast, American officials said.The Houthis have been locked in a prolonged civil war with Yemen's official government - backed by Saudi Arabia - since 2014.

20/11/2023 15:29:00	Emily Hand: Missing Irish-Israeli girl's dad talks of 'nightmare' - BBC News	An Irishman whose nine-year-old daughter is believed to have been abducted by Hamas has described the incident as "his worst nightmare".  Dublin-born Tom Hand was initially informed that Emily Hand was among a group of people killed in an attack on a kibbutz on 7 October. The Irish embassy in Israel later confirmed to Irish broadcaster RTÉ that Emily was believed to have been abducted rather than killed.Mr Hand said on Monday that he prayed that he would get Emily back.But he said he knew that she would be "very broken" and it would "take a long time to fix her".He was speaking at a news conference at the Israeli embassy in London, where some of the hostages’ families pleaded for their release.“They took her away, led away by terrorists… kidnapped and taken to Gaza,” Mr Hand said.“And now we are just waiting for news. "This is my worst nightmare - believe me, it’s a nightmare.“If you have families and kids, just imagine one day [that] one of them is gone. "The sheer terror of a nine-year old-girl down in those dark tunnels.“Sheer terror and panic every hour of every day. "She must be saying every day: ‘Where is my daddy - why isn’t he coming to save me?’”Speaking to RTÉ, external earlier this month, Emily's family said the Israeli Defense Forces now believed there was a "high possibility" she was among the people being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.Emily was in Kibbutz Be'eri, about three miles from Gaza, when Hamas launched its attack.More than 100 people were killed in the kibbutz.Israel began attacking Gaza after Hamas fighters crossed the border on 7 October, killing 1,200 Israelis and taking more than 200 hostage.Since the Hamas attacks of 7 October, Israel has been carrying out military action in Gaza. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs previously said it was "aware of the case of Emily Hand and is providing consular assistance to her family".The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 13,000 people have been killed in the territory since Israel began its campaign against Hamas.	
20/11/2023 10:31:00	Gaza: Belfast-born dad reunited with children fleeing warzone - BBC News	A Belfast-born man who lost his wife, his mother and other family members in a bomb in Gaza has been reunited with his young children in Dublin Airport.Khalid El-Estal vowed to look after his four-year-old son Ali and one-year-old daughter Sara in honour of his wife Ashwak Jendia who died last month.The children left Gaza via Egypt with assistance from the Irish government. They are among more than 50 Irish-Palestinian citizens and dependents who have travelled to Ireland with help from the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs. "Finally we did it, but we lost a lot – we lost their mum and my mum and my brother," Mr El-Estal told reporters at Dublin Airport. "But it’s ok, we will be strong and I will take care of them."He thanked everyone who joined him at the airport and asked for his wife and family to be remembered.Mr El-Estal said the reunion was bittersweet.“It is mixed emotion, you don’t understand what you feel,” he added.“My little daughter, she don’t even know, she’s afraid of me, because I left when she was only three months.”Mr El-Estal moved away from his family to work when his children were very young.He had publicly appealed for help to get his children out of the war zone after five members of his family were killed in the same attack. His wife, mother, brother, uncle and two cousins died in a bombing at an apartment block in Gaza.Speaking to BBC's Sunday Sequence programme ahead of his expected reunion with his children, Mr El-Estal said he had "mixed emotions".He said: "Of course I am excited and happy for them but I am thinking about my wife and how great it would be if she was with them."Mr El-Estal was working in Saudi Arabia when his wife was killed.He returned to Belfast a few weeks ago and sought diplomat assistance to get his children to safety. He told the BBC of the children's "very difficult, dangerous" journey, travelling from Khan Yunis in Gaza to the border crossing at Rafah.With a communication blackout in the territory, Mr El-Estal was left without information as the children made the journey."They spent all the day on the border... I didn't know until they made it to Egypt."Born in Belfast, he attended primary school in the Botanic area while his father worked as a lecturer at Queen's University.When he was aged eight, the family relocated to Gaza, where he met his wife Ashwak at university.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 12,300 people have been killed in the territory since Israel began its campaign last month. Israel launched air strikes in response to an assault on 7 October when Hamas gunmen entered Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostages.The first group of Irish citizens and their dependants returned to Dublin Airport from Gaza on Saturday.Meanwhile, former Irish president Mary Robinson has co-signed an open letter to US President Joe Biden calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.The letter, signed by a group of former international leaders known as The Elders, of which Mrs Robinson is chair, urged the president to lead international efforts in resolving the situation between Israel and the Palestinians."We have to see a new vision for peace and an American leadership of a coalition to achieve that," she told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme.However, Mrs Robinson said it would be impossible to reach an agreement while the current leaderships of both Israeli and Palestinian sides remained in place.She described the Israeli government as "very right-wing", adding that it showed "no sign at the best of times of being willing to see the need for a state of Palestine"."On the contrary we've seen Jewish supremacy talked about very openly," she said.Mrs Robinson said she was "shocked" when she visited the region in February with former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. She said it was important that Ireland is prepared to speak with a "moral voice" on the conflict.There is a need to "recognise the injustice of the occupation" while being "very clear that Israel has a right to defend itself, that its absolutely vital to get the hostages released",  she added.Mrs Robinson, 79, was Irish president from 1990 to 1997.She was a UN high commissioner for human rights between 1997 and 2002.You can see the interview with her in full on the BBC iPlayer.More on Israel-Gaza warFrom Gaza: Giving birth with no painkillers under the bombs in GazaFrom Israel: Hostages' fates haunt Israel as Gaza war intensifies Explained: The faces of hostages taken from IsraelHistory behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflict	
19/11/2023 22:22:00	Israel says CCTV footage shows hostages were taken to Gaza hospital - BBC News	The Israeli military has released footage which it says shows hostages being taken into Gaza's largest hospital after the deadly Hamas attacks of 7 October. A military spokesman said one of them - a soldier - was murdered there.Cpl Noa Marciano, 19, was killed after being taken into al-Shifa hospital with minor injuries, he said.Israel said a tunnel had been found at the site which it claims was a Hamas command centre. Hamas denies that.The BBC has not been able to verify the video which was presented at a news briefing by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Sunday."This morning we updated Noa's family that according to our findings, she was kidnapped to a safe house near Shifa," Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, IDF chief spokesperson told reporters."During IDF air strikes in the area, the Hamas terrorist who was holding Noa was killed and she was wounded in the air strike, but not a life-threatening injury. Noa was taken inside Shifa hospital, where she was murdered by another Hamas terrorist."Hamas has previously claimed Ms Marciano was killed in an Israeli air strike, which the IDF said occurred on 9 November. Rear Adm Hagari then played CCTV footage which he said was from the morning of 7 October - the day Hamas launched its surprise attack on southern Israel in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 240 taken hostage.The video showed two hostages being brought into the hospital, Gaza's largest and most modern. Armed men can be seen in the CCTV video which is date-stamped 7 October. One of the hostages appears to be resisting - the other is shown on a stretcher. The IDF has been under pressure to substantiate its claim that Hamas operated an expansive command centre underneath the vast medical complex in the north of the territory.Responding to the video released by Israel, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said it was not able to confirm the authenticity of the footage.The ministry also said it was Israel which bore full responsibility for the deterioration and collapse of health services in Gaza.Earlier, the IDF released a video that it said showed a tunnel 10m (33ft) below ground that runs for 55m up to a closed and reinforced door.It said this was now part of the evidence that "clearly proves" numerous buildings in the hospital's complex have been "used by Hamas as cover for terrorist infrastructure and activities".The latest video is not yet the evidence that's been promised of the sort of vast and intricate operation depicted in a computer simulation which the IDF previously released showing what it believes any Hamas base underground at al-Shifa could look like.The US has said it also has intelligence that Hamas has used hospitals in the Gaza Strip, including al-Shifa, as command centres and weapons stores. Israel has cited US intelligence to substantiate their claim of the existence of a major headquarters at the complex but the Americans' use of the term "node" may suggest a smaller operation.Israel believes it is building a credible case and is keen to present evidence as and when it finds it. While Israel's allies have supported its military campaign of retaliation, which it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, they have expressed a lot of unease at the toll that the offensive is having on civilians.The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 12,300. More than 2,000 people are feared to be buried under rubble.The government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also under pressure from families of the hostages. They want him to do more to free those held by Hamas. On Saturday, protesters calling on the Israeli government to prioritise securing the release of hostages walked from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem before holding a demonstration outside Mr Netanyahu's residence. The prime minister, however, appears undeterred in his mission.He says his first goal of the war is to destroy Hamas; the second to return the hostages; and the third to eliminate the threat from Gaza.

Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said this was "another act of Iranian terrorism". Iran has not commented. Houthis had threatened to hijack Israeli ship within their reach over Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.Israel says 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage during the surprise Hamas attack on the south of the country on 7 October.Israel has launched a massive military operation - involving air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops - with the aim of eliminating Hamas.The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 12,300.

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has recently said that what he called resistance groups allied to Tehran were "cleverly adjusting pressure" on Israel and its supporters.Earlier this month, the Houthis shot down a US military drone off Yemen's coast, American officials said.The Houthis have been locked in a prolonged civil war with Yemen's official government - backed by Saudi Arabia - since 2014. 	
19/11/2023 18:04:00	Gaza war: Premature babies evacuated from al-Shifa hospital - BBC News	Thirty-one premature Palestinian babies have been evacuated from Gaza City's al-Shifa hospital, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has described as a "death zone".The babies have been taken to an Emirati hospital in the southern city of Rafah, close to the Egyptian border.Hundreds of people, including patients, left from al-Shifa on Saturday.The hospital - the territory's largest and most modern - is under the control of Israeli troops.They have been searching the complex for evidence that it served as headquarters of Hamas.On Saturday, hundreds of people, including some patients, evacuated the hospital, but some 300 critically ill people remained as well as 33 premature babies. A Red Crescent spokeswoman told the BBC that one baby then died on Friday evening and another on Saturday morning.On Sunday the 31 surviving babies were evacuated by the Red Crescent in coordination with the UN.World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the babies were "very sick", had been moved under "extremely intense and high-risk security conditions", and were now "receiving urgent care in the neonatal intensive care unit" in Rafah.Dr Mohammad Zaqout, general director of hospitals in the Gaza Strip, told AP some of the babies were dehydrated or had developed gastritis due to unsanitised water. Lack of medications had caused others to develop sepsis, and some had hypothermia as they could not be placed in incubators.The babies had been accompanied by six health workers and 10 staff family members, Dr Tedros said.Doctors at al-Shifa had previously said newborns had died after power for incubators was cut off due to a lack of fuel.Red Crescent spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh told the BBC that some of the premature babies' parents had been killed in Israeli air strikes. The BBC is not able to independently verify this.She said the surviving parents had been ordered to leave Gaza City - where al-Shifa hospital is located - before the babies' evacuation, and their current whereabouts were unknown.A Gaza health ministry Facebook page urged the babies' parents to rejoin their babies at the hospital in Rafah.Israel has not yet commented, though it previously said it would help evacuate babies to a "safer hospital".  The WHO was planning further missions to take the remaining patients and staff out of al-Shifa once safe passage guarantees had been secured, he said.Al-Shifa's hospital director Dr Muhammad Abu Salima has called on the WHO and the UN to help the medical teams and patients "leave this desolated place". He told BBC Arabic there were about 25 medical staff left at the hospital, but that without water and electricity they were unable to properly care for the hundreds of remaining patients."The hospital, now, is a ghost house in the full sense of the word," he said. "Corpses are spreading out in the emergency department, patients are screaming, the medical staff is quite helpless, while the army is walking freely around in the hospital," he said.Israel has said Hamas has a command centre under al-Shifa - a claim Hamas has denied - but has not yet provided substantial evidence of this. Later on Sunday the Israeli military released footage which it said showed a "55m-long terror tunnel, 10m deep underneath the Shifa hospital". The footage shows a tunnel leading to a door. The IDF said investigations were "continuing to uncover the route of the tunnel".Earlier this week, Israel military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, said it could take weeks to fully search the medical complex.Hamas, classified as a terrorist organisation in many Western countries, attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostage.Israel has launched a massive retaliatory operation - involving air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops - with the aim of eliminating Hamas.The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 12,300. More than 2,000 more are feared to be buried under rubble.	
19/11/2023 16:48:00	Israel hopeful of Hamas deal to release hostages in 'coming days' - BBC News	The Israeli ambassador to the US says he is hopeful a deal for the release of a significant number of hostages will be reached "in the coming days". Michael Herzog told ABC "serious efforts" were being made, but that the fewer details he revealed, "the better the chances of such a deal".Hamas took an estimated 240 people hostage during their 7 October attacks which killed 1,200 Israelis.Qatar, which has been mediating, also says a deal is within reach.The Washington Post newspaper has reported that Israel and Hamas are "close to agreement on a US-brokered deal that would free dozens of women and children held hostage in Gaza in exchange for a five-day pause in fighting", citing "people familiar with the emerging terms".Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said on Sunday that only "very minor" practical and logistical obstacles remain, adding that "we are close enough to reach a deal".The US has not confirmed any details of progress. White House National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson posted on X: "We have not reached a deal yet, but we continue to work hard to get to a deal."And Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out a full ceasefire.Qatar has been playing a leading role in mediation efforts to secure the release of hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza.It was involved in the negotiations that have seen four people freed so far - a mother and daughter, who are US nationals, and two elderly Israeli women.The small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state is home to the political leadership of Hamas, which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh.On Saturday, protesters calling on the Israeli government to prioritise securing the release of hostages walked from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem before holding a demonstration outside Mr Netanyahu's residence. Mr Netanyahu has been criticised for not doing more to free those held by Hamas. In a press conference on Saturday night, he said the first goal of the war was to destroy Hamas, the second was to return the hostages and the third was to eliminate the threat from Gaza."We want answers," said protester Ari Levi, who had two family members - including his 12-year-old son - taken by Hamas from kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October."It's not normal to have children kidnapped for 43 days. We don't know what the government is doing, we don't have any information," Mr Levi told the AFP news agency."I want the government to bring them home to us," said Dvora Cohen, 43, whose brother-in-law and 12-year-old nephew are both believed to be held by Hamas.This week Israel's military said it had found the bodies of two hostages - 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss and 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano - in the Gaza Strip.Israel has launched a massive retaliatory operation - involving air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops - with the aim of eliminating Hamas.The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 12,300.

19/11/2023 14:10:00	Inside the West Bank district under harsh Israeli lockdown since Hamas attack - BBC News	Fawaz Qafisha cracked his front door open a few inches, stuck his head through the gap and squinted against the sun. The street outside was almost completely dead, save for an Israeli soldier who was sitting on a garden chair placed opposite Qafisha's house, facing the front door. Before Qafisha had even adjusted his eyes to the light and spotted us coming down the road towards him, the Israeli soldier had sprung to his feet, raised his rifle halfway and ordered Qafisha back inside. The falafel cook, aged 52, gestured for us to hurry. "This is how it is any time we try to open the door now," he said, as we entered. "We are not even allowed to stand at our windows."Qafisha, who was born and raised in Hebron, in the occupied West Bank, is a resident of H2, a dense and heavily fortified district that is home to 39,000 Palestinians and roughly 900 Israeli settlers considered some of the most extreme in the occupied territory. The Palestinians and Israelis of H2 are separated in some places here by just a few feet, and surrounded by cameras, cages, checkpoints, concrete blast walls and rolls of razor wire. For more than 40 days now, since the Hamas attack on Israel, 11 Palestinian neighbourhoods within H2 - comprising about 750 families - have been under one of the harshest lockdowns imposed on the area for more than 20 years. H2's population is almost entirely Palestinian, but the district is under the total control of the Israeli military, which has for the past few weeks been forcing Palestinian residents back inside their homes at gunpoint.Qafisha and his family of nine had barely left the house, he said. He did not want to take any risks. "You saw what happened when you arrived," he said. "We have a door we cannot open and windows we cannot look out from. We do not have any freedom. We are living in fear."Qafisha's house sat just off Shuhada Street, once one of the busiest Palestinian market streets in Hebron. In 1994, a massacre of 29 Muslims by a Jewish extremist at a nearby mosque led to riots, which in turn prompted a crackdown by the Israeli army. The army forcibly closed Palestinian businesses and then welded shut the front doors of the Palestinian residents, on the Shuhada Street side.Since then, the Palestinians of the area around Shuhada Street have lived through shifting restrictions on where they can go, when, and how. Flare-ups in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have often led to some form of lockdown, but several residents told the BBC that this was the harshest they had ever experienced.A few hundred feet up the road from Qafisha's house, Zleekhah Mohtaseb, a 61-year-old former tour guide and translator, was staring down from her rooftop, watching a young Israeli settler shouting to himself as he meandered slowly down Shuhada Street. Mohtaseb had had spent all her six decades within a stone's throw of where she stood now, she said. Directly across Shuhada street, no more than 20 feet away, was Hebron Cemetery, where 10 generations of her family were buried. Once upon a time, she could walk straight across the street and into the cemetery. Now it took her an hour by car."The settlers," she said, shaking her head, as the young Israeli walked past her welded-shut front door. "They can do what they want. They are the chosen people."Mohtaseb had seen a lot in her lifetime in Hebron, but the past 40 days had been among the most tense, she said. Hours after Hamas attacked Israel, in a murderous rampage that left an estimated 1,200 Israelis dead, Palestinian residents of H2 received messages from the Israeli military telling them that they were no longer allowed to leave their homes. Israeli soldiers began forcing people off the streets at gunpoint, including Mohtaseb. "Those first two weeks were hell," she said. Two weeks after it began, the curfew in H2 relented slightly, allowing the Palestinians to leave their homes for certain hours on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. Then this past Thursday, as Mohtaseb was preparing to meet us, three Palestinian militants from Hebron attacked an Israeli checkpoint dividing the West Bank from Jerusalem, killing one soldier and wounding five. Immediately, she knew that the attack would prolong and intensify the crackdown in H2."Everyone says that Israel has the right to defend herself. Fine. We are not against it. But what about us, the Palestinians?" she said."Many times we were attacked, many times we were killed, many times we were forced from our homes. Where was this right to defend when the Palestinians were attacked?"H2 began life in 1997 when Hebron was divided into two sectors, under an agreement between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel. H1, populated entirely by Palestinians and controlled by the Palestinian Authority, accounts for roughly 80% of the city. H2, which accounts for just 20% of the city, is populated almost entirely by Palestinians but controlled by the Israeli military. Within H2, the area around Shuhada Street and the Ibrahimi Mosque is the most fortified by checkpoints and guard posts. It has seen decades of tension, violence, and terror attacks from both sides. "This is the closed place inside the closed place," said Muhammad Mohtaseb, a 30-year-old hospital security guard, sitting on the roof of his house opposite the mosque. "We are completely surrounded by checkpoints," he said. "Even on a good day, I cannot drive a car, no car can come in with Palestinian number plates. If I want to bring something to my house, I have to carry it half a kilometre from the checkpoint. When I got married, I bought all new furniture for my bedroom, but I had to take it all apart into pieces on the other side of the checkpoint to get it through the turnstiles, then rebuild it on this side."That was a good day. Since 7 October, the freedom even to move around in the street was gone. When we arrived at Mohtaseb's home, just like at the home of Fawaz Qafisha, a soldier sprang towards the door and ordered Mohtaseb back inside. Up on the roof, Mohtaseb rolled a cigarette and looked out over the empty streets. With three of his four children out of school - the H2 schools have all been closed - Mohtaseb had been at home and away from work for 40 days. Fortunately for him, his employer had been understanding and was still paying him.This was not the case for everyone. Qafisha, the falafel cook, had been unable to fulfil his work responsibilities since the lockdown began, because he could only go out three days a week, and on those three days the allotted hours did not match the hours he would need to travel for work anyway. And unlike Mohtaseb's employer, his had not been understanding. "In these jobs, if you work you eat," he said. "And if you don't work you don't eat."Qafisha had borrowed money several times from friends, to buy food for the family, but he was running out of options. "Anything that you spend you cannot replace," he said, sitting in his living room, away from the window. "So we are sinking." The following morning, there was another armed attack on Israeli soldiers by a Palestinian militant, this one in Hebron itself. This time it resulted in only the attacker's death. But a few hours later, another message was sent out via WhatsApp from the Israeli military to the Palestinian residents of Shuhada Street."A notification for the residents of Shuhada Street," it said. "You are forbidden to be in the streets for one week." And if they left H2, it said, they would not be allowed to re-enter until the week had passed.The lockdown in H2 was a "blatant example of how Israel is implementing collective punishment in the West Bank", said Dror Sadot, a spokeswoman for the Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem."The Palestinians in Hebron are paying a price for something they didn't do," she said. "People cannot go to work, children cannot go to school, they are having trouble getting water and food. It is collective punishment, and it is illegal under international law."The Israeli military told the BBC in a statement that its forces operate in the West Bank "in accordance with the situational assessment in order to provide security to all residents of the area.""Accordingly, there are dynamic checkpoints and efforts to monitor movement in different areas in Hebron," it said.Among the Israeli settlers living in H2, in the hardline Kiryat Arba settlement, is Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir. On Thursday, Ben Gvir, who has personally overseen the distribution of thousands of new rifles to West Bank settlers since October 7th, said that Israel should take the same approach to the occupied territory that it was taking in Gaza, where more than 11,000 Palestinians have now been killed. "Containment will blow up in our faces," Ben Gvir said, of the West Bank. "Just like it did in Gaza."According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, more than 200 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since 7 October, by settlers or in clashes with the military.On Wednesday, just a few hundred metres from Ben Gvir's house, Areej Jabari had gathered a small group of women into a knitting circle in her home in H2, in defiance of the Israeli orders not to move in the streets that day. This was only the second successful gathering since the lockdown began, and there were only eight women present, down from around 50 who usually gather once a week at the mosque. The knitters had got there by sleight. "We sneak through the side roads and between the buildings," said Huda Jabari, Areej's younger cousin, with a grin. The women have learned, this long into the lockdown, to observe the Israeli soldiers and move when they are not looking. They use one another's houses to avoid checkpoints within H2, entering the front door in one sector and emerging from the back door into another. "In normal times, 50 families pass through my house to get around," said Areej's mother Sameera, whose own house sat in the shadow of Ben Gvir's.Areej took us up to her roof to show us her view, over an Israeli military base and guard post close to her house. Below us, Israeli settlers passed by along her street, which she was no longer allowed to use. Since 7 October, Areej had been coming up here to the roof with her video camera to gather footage of the soldiers and send it to B'Tselem, the human rights organisation. In return, the Israeli military arrived at her house last Saturday and forced their way in, she said. "They broke my press card and warned me not to take any more video or post anything on social media."They also forbade her to go up onto her roof, she said, or look out of her windows on Fridays or Saturdays, when the Israeli settlers use her road to walk from the settlement to the Jewish holy site near Shuhada Street. The IDF told the BBC that it was aware of the incident Areej described and was following up with the specific soldiers involved to examine what happened. "We are taking this incident very seriously," a spokesperson said.To Areej, it did not feel particularly out of the ordinary. "Any time something happens they put more restrictions on us," she said. "The goal is to divide us, to split the area into small pieces and to pressure us to leave."She was standing up against the railing around the roof of her home, looking out over H2. "I call this area the fortress of steadfastness," she said. She opened her video camera and pointed it in the direction of the Israeli guard post down the road.Muath al-Khatib contributed to this report. Photographs by Joel Gunter	
19/11/2023 06:30:00	WHO says Gaza's al-Shifa hospital a death zone, as hundreds leave - BBC News	The World Health Organization (WHO) has described al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City as a "death zone".A joint UN team led by the WHO assessed the hospital for one hour following its occupation by the Israeli military and as some patients and those seeking shelter there began to evacuate it.The team said they saw evidence of shelling and gunfire and observed a mass grave at the hospital's entrance.They were told it held the remains of 80 people.Following an evacuation which the hospital director said was ordered by the Israeli army but which the army said was requested by the director, 300 critically ill patients remain in al-Shifa - formerly the largest and most advanced hospital in Gaza.The WHO said it was trying to arrange the urgent evacuation of remaining patients and staff to other facilities in Gaza, and repeated calls for a ceasefire.Meanwhile, the White House has responded to a report in the Washington Post which said Israel, Hamas and the US were on the verge of a deal that would see the release of women and children seized by Hamas on 7 October in exchange for a five-day pause in fighting.A White House spokesperson said no such deal had yet been reached but it was working hard to get one agreed.Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has ruled out a full ceasefire with Hamas and said he will consider only a temporary truce in exchange for the return of hostages kidnapped by the group.Hundreds of people, including some patients, left al-Shifa on Saturday. A journalist at al-Shifa hospital told the BBC that only "patients who could not move and a very small number of doctors" remained behind. "We raised our hands and carried white flags," Khader, a journalist who had been at al-Shifa, told the BBC.The IDF denied ordering the evacuation of al-Shifa and said it had agreed to a request from the hospital's director for those wanting to leave to evacuate through a "secure route". "At no point did the IDF order the evacuation of patients or medical teams and in fact proposed that any request for medical evacuation will be facilitated by the IDF," a statement said. Dr Ramez Radwan, a doctor who said he was ordered to leave al-Shifa by Israeli authorities, described the situation at the hospital as "miserable", saying there were no painkillers or antibiotics and some patients had "worms coming out of the wounds". Israel's military has raided the hospital in recent days, as part of what it describes as a "targeted operation against Hamas", but is yet to provide substantial evidence that the group conducted a major operation in tunnels underneath the medical complex. Separately, Hamas health officials said two explosions in Jabalia in northern Gaza together killed 80 people.Israel told the BBC it could not confirm it struck a UN school-turned-shelter but was investigating.BBC Verify has geolocated footage to al-Fakhoura school in Jabalia that shows many people - including women and children - with severe injuries or lying motionless on the floor in different parts of the building. There are more than 20 such casualties visible in the footage, and around half of these are seen in one particular room on the ground floor, which also shows signs of considerable damage.The head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, said he had seen "horrifying images and footage of scores of people killed and injured" in one of his agency's schools "sheltering thousands of displaced". "These attacks cannot become commonplace, they must stop," he said. Elsewhere, the Hamas-run health ministry said more than 30 people from the same family had been killed elsewhere in Jabalia, in what it also said was an Israeli strike.The IDF had no immediate comment on the report but said it was expanding operations in Gaza, including in Jabalia, to target Hamas.It has told Palestinians in northern Gaza to leave for their own safety and has now begun telling people in the southern city of Khan Younis, where many thousands of people who have fled northern Gaza are, that they must now also leave.Israel says the aim is to wipe out Hamas, following its attack on Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage.The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza has reached 12,300. More than 2,000 more are feared to be buried under rubble.	
18/11/2023 21:37:00	March reaches Jerusalem calling for release of Israeli hostages - BBC News	Thousands of Israelis have joined the families of hostages held in Gaza to call on the government to prioritise securing their release. Protesters walked from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem before holding a demonstration outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence. He has been criticised for not doing more to free those held by Hamas. It comes as US President Joe Biden reiterated calls for a two-state solution. Of the estimated 240 people taken hostage by Hamas during their deadly 7 October attacks, only four have been freed so far and another, a soldier, was rescued in an Israeli operation. This week Israel's military said it had found the bodies of two hostages - 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss and 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano - in the Gaza Strip. The protest calling for the hostages' release started in Tel Aviv on Tuesday before heading to Jerusalem. Near the end of their march protesters stopped briefly to release hundreds of yellow helium balloons. "We want answers," said Ari Levi, who had two family members - including his 12-year-old son - taken by Hamas from kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October. "It's not normal to have children kidnapped for 43 days. We don't know what the government is doing, we don't have any information," Mr Levi told the AFP news agency. "I want the government to bring them home to us," said Dvora Cohen, 43, whose brother-in-law and 12-year-old nephew are both believed to be held by Hamas.  In a press conference on Saturday night Mr Netanyahu said that "until now there has not been a hostage release deal", adding that "when we have something to say, we will update you". He said that the first goal of the war is to destroy Hamas, the second is to return the hostages and the third is to eliminate the threat from Gaza.On Saturday, about 400 people protested in Caesarea, north of Tel Aviv, calling on Mr Netanyahu to resign, according to local media reports. One sign read: "He who blames only the army does not deserve to command it." Last month Mr Netanyahu swiftly deleted a social media post blaming military and security chiefs for allowing the Hamas attacks to take place. He later apologised. Separately, in an article published in the Washington Post on Saturday, Mr Biden said the two-state solution is "the only way to ensure the long-term security of both the Israeli and Palestinian people". The president was referring to a final settlement that would see the creation of an independent state of Palestine living peacefully alongside Israel.  "A two-state solution - two peoples living side-by-side with equal measures of freedom, opportunity and dignity - is where the road to peace must lead," Mr Biden wrote, adding that achieving it would require "commitments from Israelis and Palestinians". The article - which also accused Hamas of having an "ideology of destruction" - appeared to be aimed at Mr Netanyahu, who has opposed the two-state solution throughout his political career. His survival as prime minister depends in part on support from Israeli hardliners who believe the entire territory between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea was given to the Jewish people by God.Mr Netanyahu has previously said that Israel must maintain "overall military responsibility" in Gaza "for the foreseeable future". Mr Biden also said the Palestinian Authority should govern the Gaza Strip and the West Bank after the Israel-Hamas war, adding that his government is prepared to issue visa bans against "extremists" attacking civilians in the occupied West Bank. 	
18/11/2023 17:06:00	Gaza protesters force Cardiff museum to shut front doors - BBC News	A Cardiff museum had to close its front doors after demonstrators chanting "Free Palestine" entered the building.Protesters went into National Museum Wales in the city centre, where they displayed Palestinian flags.Saturday saw a pro-Palestinian march in Cardiff city centre for the fifth weekend in a row over the Gaza war. The museum apologised for any inconvenience, but said it shut the doors to protect the safety of visitors and staff. It said people could still access the museum via the Reardon Smith Theatre on the side of the building, and they would open the front doors as soon as it was safe to do so.Israel launched a major military campaign in the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas, which it considers a terrorist group, in retaliation for the 7 October cross-border attack by hundreds of gunmen. At least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's assault on Israel and about 240 others were taken hostage.Since Israel started its counterattack, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 11,400 people have been killed in the territory and the United Nations has warned of a "humanitarian disaster".	
18/11/2023 15:02:00	Israel orders Khan Younis evacuation in southern Gaza - BBC News	Israel has told Palestinians in Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, to leave their homes. The city hosts hundreds of thousands who fled northern Gaza as Israel began a ground operation against Hamas. The new order suggests the military operations could soon move towards the south of the Gaza Strip. Israel says the aim is to wipe out Hamas, following its attack on Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 12,000 people have been killed by Israel since then, including 5,000 children.On Saturday, Israeli missiles struck a residential building in Khan Younis, killing 26 people, a local health official said. Israel has not yet commented on the incident. But it has been dropping leaflets in the wider area, urging people to leave for shelters."We're asking people to relocate. I know it's not easy for many of them, but we don't want to see civilians caught up in the crossfire," Mark Regev, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told US network MSNBC on Friday. Israel did not want to see "civilians caught up in the crossfire", Mr Regev said.He said Israeli troops would need to advance into the city to remove Hamas fighters from underground tunnels, adding he was "pretty sure" those being urged to relocate "won't have to move again" if they head west, towards the Mediterranean Sea.Mr Regev said the areas they were being asked to move to would "hopefully have tents and a field hospital", although no such plans have yet been publicised, and it is unclear if such facilities would be able to accommodate potentially well over a million evacuees. Because the western areas are close to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, humanitarian aid could be brought in "as quickly as possible", Mr Regev said.Like elsewhere in the Gaza Strip, southern Gaza has been in the grip of a humanitarian crisis since 7 October, when Israel enforced a full-scale blockage.There have been widespread reports of water, food and fuel shortages, as well as concerns about healthcare facilities and sanitation conditions. Israel has launched near-constant air strikes across much of the Gaza Strip, as well as a ground incursion into northern Gaza, including reducing much of Gaza City - the enclave's largest city - to rubble. The UN estimates that at least 1.5 million people in Gaza are internally displaced, with overcrowding a major concern. Many are sheltering in UN facilities, as well as hospitals, churches and public buildings. Much of the recent fighting has centred on Gaza City's al-Shifa Hospital, where Israel says Hamas has been operating a command-and-control centre, which Hamas denies. Israel is yet to provide substantial evidence to back its claim. Hundreds of people are reported to have left al-Shifa on Saturday, with one journalist who left the hospital telling the BBC "we raised our hands and carried white flags". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have denied ordering an evacuation of the hospital, but said it had agreed to a request from a hospital director and was providing a "secure route" for those wishing to leave.Hamas officials say 120 patients remain at the hospital, along with premature babies.There are also reports that a UN school-turned-shelter in northern Gaza has been hit, with many casualties.The Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip told the AFP news agency that at least 50 people had been killed in an Israeli strike on the Al-Fakhoura school.BBC Verify has geolocated footage to the school that shows many people - including women and children - with severe injuries or lying motionless on the floor in different parts of the building. There are more than 20 such casualties visible in the footage, and around half of these are seen in one particular room on the ground floor, which also shows signs of considerable damage.An IDF spokesman told the BBC that he could not confirm it was an IDF strike and was looking into the incident.The head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) Philippe Lazzarini said he had seen "horrifying images and footage of scores of people killed and injured" in one of his agency's schools "sheltering thousands of displaced". "These attacks cannot become commonplace, they must stop," he said.	
18/11/2023 09:19:00	Wirral family distraught as mother trapped in Gaza - BBC News	A distraught husband has told how his young children cry everyday for their mother, who is trapped in Gaza. Teacher Islam Alashi, 37, left her home in Wirral to visit her sick father before the war between Israel and Hamas erupted. Ms Alashi is sheltering in the city of Khan Younis, but has run out of food and is now drinking rainwater. Husband Feiz Chihaoui, 45, said he wakes up every day saying "I hope she'll be alive".Mr Chihaoui last spoke to his wife on Thursday, with missiles raining down around her. "She answered the phone and she was crying and she was telling me I don't know if I'm going to die now or I'm going to survive," he said. "I'm very depressed. I feel so lonely, the kids when they're going to school and at night-time are crying saying I miss my mum."Ms Alashi, who lives in Wallasey with Mr Chihaoui and their two children, travelled to Gaza on 16 September. She was staying near the Al-Shifa hospital, scene of some of heaviest bombing and fiercest fighting in Gaza City, but after her aunt's house was badly damaged by shelling she walked 13km south to Khan Younis. Her sick father accompanied her in a donkey cart as he could not walk. The family's MP Angela Eagle has raised her case and her name is now on the list of people the UK wants to get out of Gaza. "We just want to get the kids' mother back," Mr Chihaoui said. "Every day when I wake up I say I hope she'll be alive. I just want her to get out."Christina Lahive, who is the head teacher at the primary school where Ms Alashi's children attend, said: "The children still have not got their mother, she may be on the list, but she's not here and we need to her here."Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

18/11/2023 05:20:00	Israel says it will allow two trucks of fuel a day into Gaza - BBC News	Israel says it will allow two fuel trucks a day to enter the Gaza Strip, after pressure to do so from the US.A US State Department official says around 140,000 litres of fuel will be allowed in every two days. Most of that is intended for trucks delivering aid, as well as supporting the UN in providing water and sanitation, the official said.The rest is for mobile phone and internet services, which had been cut off due to a lack of fuel.On Friday, the company which provides Gaza's communications said that its services were returning after receiving some fuel via Unrwa, the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees. The US official said Washington exerted considerable pressure on Israel to push this fuel agreement through. The deal had been agreed in principle weeks ago, the official added, but was delayed by Israel for two reasons. Israeli officials told the US that fuel had not actually run out in southern Gaza, and they also wanted to wait and see if they could negotiate a hostage deal first. The head of Unrwa warned on Thursday that the agency may have to suspend all of its activities due to the lack of fuel.In its latest situation report, the agency said it required "160,000 litres of fuel every day for basic humanitarian operations" - more than double what has been agreed. Earlier, an Israeli official said the new fuel allowance would be brought in through the Rafah crossing to the civilian population in the southern Gaza Strip via the UN, provided that it does not reach Hamas.The Israeli official said the fuel would give "minimal" support to water, sewage and sanitation systems, in order to prevent the outbreak of epidemics that could spread in the area.International organisations have repeatedly expressed grave concerns over the humanitarian situation unfolding in the Gaza Strip. The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously warned of "worrying trends" in the spread of disease in Gaza, where the lack of fuel and Israeli bombardment have severely disrupted the healthcare system and sanitation facilities. On Friday, Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative in the Palestinian Territories, said that more than 70,000 cases of acute respiratory infections and over 44,000 cases of diarrhoea had been recorded, according to Reuters - figures significantly higher than expected.Fuel is needed in Gaza to run the enclave's desalination plant, to provide electricity to homes and hospitals, and for sanitation, transport, and communications infrastructure. It is also crucial for the delivery of aid around the territory.Israel has been blocking fuel from entering Gaza, arguing that it could be stolen by Hamas and used for military purposes. Before the latest war Israel provided the majority of Gaza's electricity, and some was produced by the enclave's sole power plant which is no longer functioning.On Saturday in Gaza's south, the director of Nasser hospital in Khan Younis said it had received the bodies of 26 people, and 23 others with serious injuries, after an air strike on a residential building in Hamad city.The Israeli military has not yet commented on the report.Meanwhile, the Red Crescent said at least five Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on a building in the Balata refugee camp in the West Bank city of Nablus.The Israeli army said it was checking on the reports.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told Israel to take "urgent" action to "de-escalate tensions in the West Bank, including by confronting rising levels of settler extremist violence".The strike happened a day after Israeli military said it killed at least seven militants in two separate confrontations in the West Bank.Israel's latest siege and military operation began following Hamas's brutal 7 October attack, when the group - which is banned as a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other powers - killed around 1,200 people and took more than 230 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. At least 12,000 people have been killed in the territory since Israel began its retaliatory strikes, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the Palestinian enclave. 	
17/11/2023 18:22:00	Biden facing growing internal dissent over Israel's Gaza campaign - BBC News	US President Joe Biden is under growing pressure to rein in Israel's military campaign against Hamas in Gaza. The thousands of civilian casualties and desperate humanitarian conditions have alarmed Arab allies, but also stirred an extraordinary level of criticism from within his own administration. "I'm stunned by the intensity," said Aaron David Miller, who worked as an adviser on Arab-Israeli relations during a 25 year tenure at the US State Department.  "I've never seen anything quite like this."  Several internal memos have been sent to Secretary of State Antony Blinken through a channel, established after the Vietnam war,  which allows employees to register disapproval of policy.  An open letter is also said to be circulating at the Agency for International Development (USAID). Another has been dispatched to the White House by political appointees and staff members representing dozens of government agencies. Another to members of Congress by staffers on Capitol Hill.Much of this dissent is private, and the signatures are often anonymous out of concerns the protest might affect jobs, so the full scale of it is not clear. But according to leaks cited by multiple reports, hundreds of people have signed on to the wave of opposition. An administration official has told the BBC that these concerns are very real and there are active discussions about them.At a minimum, the letters are asking that President Biden demand an immediate ceasefire, and push Israel much harder to allow for more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.In some cases, the language is stronger, echoing the rhetoric of young political activists and apparently reflecting to some degree a generational divide that is more critical of Israel and sympathetic to Palestinians.The letters condemn the atrocities carried out by Hamas during its surprise 7 October attack that killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians.More than 12,000 have been killed in Gaza by Israel since that attack, according to the latest figure from the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has said it is trying to minimise civilian casualties in the war in Gaza but has not been successful, blaming this on Hamas.The high number of Palestinian deaths is a "font of the dismay" in the administration, according to Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley, a former US diplomat who is now president of the Middle East Policy Council. The administration's support for the Israeli military operation appears for many "far too much of a one-sided position for the US government", she said.Ms Abercrombie-Winstanley signed dissent cables during her career and has been consulted by current employees about whether they should do so now. These memos feel like they have a "broader reach" than others, she said, drawing in people who are not necessarily working on the specific issue at hand.  Ms Abercrombie-Winstanley believes the chorus of dismay has contributed to significant shifts in US language and approach, since the days immediately after the Hamas attack when President Biden pledged unwavering support for Israel in an emotional address.Propelled by the destruction in Gaza and growing anger in the Arab world, the administration's rhetoric on protecting civilians has become more insistent. "Far too many Palestinians have been killed" in Gaza, Mr Blinken said recently.  He and other senior officials are now treating humanitarian assistance as not only a moral imperative, but a strategic one too. This is something Mr Blinken highlights when meeting frustrated employees in listening sessions, according to State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller. He makes clear that "it is the United States of America, not any other country, that was able to secure an agreement to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza" and "to get humanitarian pauses". The secretary of state is aware of the disquiet simmering in his building and has made a point of addressing it.  "We're listening," he wrote after returning from his recent trip to the Middle East, in an email obtained by the BBC. "What you share is informing our policy and our messages."  But it has not changed core policy approaches, nor appeared to have had significant influence on Israel's military campaign.  The Biden administration has become more open about airing its growing divergences with Israel. Mr Blinken has deliberately set out principles of Palestinian governance and statehood for the "day after" in Gaza, that Israel's right-wing government rejects.  The president is frequently on the phone to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and senior officials keep up a steady drumbeat of visits to the region, pressing Israel to follow the laws of war.But there's no suggestion the Biden administration is considering using its main leverage, putting conditions on its massive military assistance to Israel, which was ramped up even further after the Hamas attack.  And Biden signalled this week that the US had not given Israel a deadline for its military campaign to end.It will end when Hamas "no longer maintains the capacity to murder, abuse and just do horrific things" to Israel, the president said.  The bottom line is that the US and Israel have the same goal, according to Mr Miller, the former adviser at the State Department. Both want to destroy Hamas's capacity as a military organisation so it can never mount a 7 October-style attack again.  With that aim in mind, he said, a full ceasefire that ends hostilities in pursuit of peace does not make operational or political sense. It only delays war, Mr Miller said, "because you're not going to get a negotiated ending to this... The tactics may differ, but the objective remains the same".So what exactly would force President Biden to change course?  Most likely not his internal opposition. For all its ferment, the dissent in the administration is not yet a revolt. Only one State Department official has publicly resigned.  Mr Miller suggests it would more likely take an external event, such as the unconditional release of all the hostages held by Hamas, or a single Israeli operation that results in mass Palestinian casualties, although the bar has been set quite high.There are also political risks for Mr Biden. His solidarity with Israel is shared by Republicans and centrist Democrats, but concerns within the younger and more left-wing elements of the Democratic Party are growing. His former election campaign staffers have sent their own letter to the president calling for a ceasefire.Gwen Schroeder, who worked on Mr Biden's digital team during the 2020 election, was one of the signatories.  She said Israel's "disproportionate response" in Gaza showed that Palestinian lives "mean less than those of our Israeli allies"."I'm not ashamed of getting Biden elected," she said, but added: "I grapple with this every day, you know, is this the administration that I fought so hard for?" It is too early to say how these sentiments might affect Mr Biden's bid for re-election next year, but it does underline the tightrope that he is walking.  He has been telling Israeli leaders that the way they fight this war will determine what is possible after it ends. How much he is able to influence that is important, because he will be linked with whatever the outcome. 	
17/11/2023 15:24:00	Labour MP repeats call for Israel-Gaza ceasefire after vote - BBC News	A Labour MP who defied leader Sir Keir Starmer to back calls for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war has repeated his demand that the fighting must stop.Afzal Khan was among eight shadow ministers to step down from the frontbench after the vote earlier this week.Labour has instead called for a "humanitarian pause".Manchester Gorton MP Mr Khan said the answer was not to be "more barbaric" than Hamas. "An eye for an eye. We will all end up blind and that's not the way forward," he said. "I feel in the response it is almost collective punishment and I feel Israel has crossed all red lines."He said it was clear that the focus should now be on finding peace. "I know this as 18 years ago I set up the Muslim Jewish Forum of Greater Manchester," he said. "In the last Gaza war we brought people together and, after that session, the thing that hit me the strongest was a simple point - both sides wanted peace."About 240 people were kidnapped by Hamas gunmen during the group's 7 October massacre, which killed 1,200 people.More than 11,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its retaliatory strikes, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The vote was on a Scottish National Party amendment to a government motion on its plans for the year ahead, presented in the King's Speech last week.It called for an end to the "collective punishment of the Palestinian people" and urged "all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire".Sir Keir had signalled before the vote that MPs holding a frontbench role would be sacked if they backed the ceasefire call.As a result, Mr Khan resigned from his role as shadow minister for exports along with Jess Phillips, Yasmin Qureshi, Paula Barker, Sarah Owen, Rachel Hopkins, Naz Shah and Andy Slaughter.It was defeated by 125 votes to 294, with the 56 Labour rebels joining other opposition parties to demand a ceasefire.A Labour motion, tabled by Sir Keir, backed a pause in the conflict instead, to allow in more humanitarian aid was also heavily defeated.  Mr Khan said while he felt Labour was moving in the right direction as a humanitarian pause was a "starting point," he said progress was slow."I think the scale of the losses we already have demands that we should have a ceasefire," he said. "My concern is we don't stop here. We need to now resolve it so we don't end up with a cycle of violence where innocent people in Israel and Palestine lose their lives."Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

17/11/2023 13:15:00	Bowen: Ceasefire demands will grow without proof of Hamas HQ at al-Shifa - BBC News	It is now days since Israeli forces entered al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, and what appears to be happening on Friday is that they are continuing their search for evidence of this being a key Hamas command centre. We have to remember that there is no independent scrutiny inside the hospital; journalists cannot move freely into Gaza, and any who are reporting from the site are working under the aegis of the Israeli military.The evidence Israel has produced, so far, I do not believe to be convincing in terms of the kind of rhetoric Israelis were using about the set-up at the hospital, which suggested this was a nerve centre for the Hamas operation. If there was a nerve centre there - and there has been speculation about that possibility since 2014 - then the Israelis have not yet revealed definitive evidence of its existence to the outside world.What has been recovered includes some Kalashnikov rifles - these are common in the Middle East - a tunnel entrance, of which there are many in Gaza, some military uniforms and a booby-trapped vehicle.The discovery of and evidence for a major Hamas headquarters underneath the hospital is of course still possible. The hospital was, after all, built by the Israelis in the 1970s during its full control of the territory, and it is a large site which will take time to thoroughly search. It's well known that the Israeli architects who designed al-Shifa included extensive basements.It is also possible that the Israelis have found something, and for their own reasons - military or security perhaps - have decided not to reveal it yet. Why that would be the case is unclear - Israel has a lot riding on al-Shifa. From the beginning of this war on 7 October, when a surprise attack launched by Hamas killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, it has said reaching the hospital is one of its main targets. Proving Hamas is using Gaza's medical facilities to cover its operations is a key Israeli objective and it is an accusation Hamas has repeatedly denied.Israel's major justification for killing so many people in Gaza - more than 11,500 in more than a month, according to the latest figure from the territory's Hamas-run health ministry - is that Hamas was using them as human shields. The Israeli Prime Minister, Benyamin Netanyahu claimed in an interview on Thursday night that Hamas had a military command centre at the hospital. He is also pointing to what he called "strong indications" that hostages had been held there too, after the Israel Defense Forces said the body of 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss, who had been kidnapped from her home in Be'eri near the Gaza boundary, was discovered in a house near al-Shifa.Negotiations are ongoing with Qatar to try to reach some sort of deal to recover the more than 200 Israeli hostages being held by Hamas inside Gaza. But if solid evidence of a Hamas headquarters cannot be found, at al-Shifa or elsewhere, then the pressure on Israel from the international community to negotiate a ceasefire is going to increase.So many civilians have been killed by Israel in Gaza in the last 42 days that concern is growing about Israel's methods in the United States - which is the only international power the Israelis really worry about. US President Biden said from the outset that Israel has the right to defend itself, but that it must do it in the right way - meaning following the laws of war.On Wednesday, the UN Security Council passed a resolution asking for extended humanitarian pauses that the Americans did not veto. This was significant because it is the first resolution that's gone through without a condemnation of Hamas that was not vetoed by the US or the UK. And another interesting development is the publication by what's called the "Elders", a group of retired prime ministers, presidents and elder statesmen and women from around the world, of a statement condemning Hamas but also saying that "Destroying Gaza and killing civilians is not making Israel safer. These actions will breed more terrorism across the region and beyond. There is no military solution to the conflict."So Israelis are aware that pressure for a ceasefire is steadily growing, and with increasing questions about Israel's strategy, that will intensify.This is not going to end easily. I do not think there is going to be a clear moment when Israel can say they have got the job done and can leave Gaza. The government also does not appear to have a plan for the day after. Mr Netanyahu has only said he expects to have security responsibility there to prevent the "re-emergence of terror".Anything that Israel does there, in a place that has experienced huge levels of killing and destruction, will see them having to deal with more than two million people who will hate them. They could possibly face an insurgency, depending on how long they stay. So for Israel it's crucial to prove that it had no choice other than to use methods that killed thousands of civilians, so that its allies will continue to shield it from international pressure for a ceasefire.	
17/11/2023 12:08:00	Netanyahu says Israel 'not successful' at minimising Gaza casualties but blames Hamas - BBC News	Israel's prime minister has said it is trying to minimise civilian casualties in the war in Gaza but has been "not successful", blaming this on Hamas.In an interview with CBS News, Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was firing at Palestinians trying to get safety.Hamas "don't give a hoot about the Palestinians", he said.More than 11,500 people have been killed in Gaza, Hamas's health ministry says, since Israel went to war after Hamas's deadly attack on 7 October.Some 1,200 people were killed and about 240 were taken back to Gaza as hostages when Hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked Israeli communities and military bases.Several of the missing people have since been confirmed dead, with Hamas blaming Israeli air strikes, although the claim cannot be independently verified.Mr Netanyahu told the BBC's US partner CBS that Israel would "try to finish the job" of wiping out Hamas in Gaza with minimal civilian casualties.He said: "That's what we're trying to do: minimal civilian casualties. But unfortunately, we're not successful."Mr Netanyahu said the Israeli military dropped leaflets urging people to leave certain areas and called civilians on their mobile phones warning them to leave but claimed Hamas was preventing this "at gun point"."Any civilian death is a tragedy. And we shouldn't have any because we're doing everything we can to get the civilians out of harm's way, while Hamas is doing everything to keep them in harm's way," he said.He added Hamas had "fired at the safe corridors that we provided for the Palestinians".Addressing Israel's military raids on Al-Shifa hospital - the biggest medical facility in Gaza - Mr Netanyahu said there were "strong indications" that Israeli hostages were being held there and this was "one of the reasons we entered".He said there were no hostages at the hospital when forces entered the hospital on Wednesday, claiming: "If there were [hostages], they were taken out."Israel said it has further intelligence about those being held, but Mr Netanyahu said "the less I say about it, the better".Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of housing a major base underneath Al-Shifa - something which Hamas and hospital authorities have always denied.Mr Netanyahu did not elaborate on what information Israel had to suggest that hostages had been held at Al-Shifa.But he said Israel had "concrete evidence" that there were "terrorist chieftains and terrorists" in the hospital who he said had fled as Israel's forces entered."Hamas was using the patients in that hospital as a human shield," he said.Mr Netanyahu said Israel had warned the hospital authorities it was going to enter the facility and to move patients out of the way, adding they were "doing this very gingerly" because they were trying to "do the moral thing".Israel's military said its soldiers had found the bodies of two hostages - 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss and 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano - in the vicinity of the hospital.	
17/11/2023 10:40:00	Israel finds second hostage body near Al-Shifa hospital - BBC News	Israel has confirmed that it has found the body of a second woman who was taken into Gaza by Hamas in its attack last month.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said 19-year-old Cpl Noa Marciano was discovered in a building next to the Al-Shifa Hospital.On Thursday, the IDF said they found the body of a 65-year-old hostage in a house near the same hospital.Troops are continuing their search in and around Gaza's biggest hospital.A spokesman for the IDF, Daniel Hagari, wrote on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that Israeli intelligence led soldiers to the exact location of her body.The IDF did not give further details on how Cpl Marciano died.Hamas's military wing claimed she was killed in an Israeli air strike on 9 November, though this could not be independently verified.Cpl Marciano was serving as a lookout at the Nahal Oz kibbutz when it was stormed by part of a wave of gunmen who had burst through the nearby Israel-Gaza border, attacking dozens of Israeli communities, several military bases and hundreds of young people attending a music festival.According to Haaretz, Cpl Marciano's mother, Adi Marciano, said in an interview that she last spoke to her daughter on the morning of the attack."She told me she was in a protected space and that there had been an infiltration... She said that she had to end the call. I didn't hear shots or screams. Half an hour later, I sent her a message, but she didn't reply."She had appeared in a video released by Hamas on Monday. The IDF called it "psychological terrorism".So far, only four of the 240 hostages who were abducted by Hamas last month have been freed.Israeli officials say that at least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's cross-border attack.Since Israel started its counter-attack, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 11,400 people have been killed in the territory.Al-Shifa, Gaza City's largest hospital, became the focus of fighting at the start of the week and was raided by the Israeli military on Wednesday morning.The IDF says Hamas has been using the hospital as a command centre and has spent two days searching the complex for evidence of this. Hamas denies operating there and the BBC cannot independently verify claims by either side.

16/11/2023 21:56:00	Israel says hostage's body found near main Gaza hospital - BBC News	Israel's military says its soldiers have found the body of an Israeli hostage taken into Gaza by Hamas in its attack last month.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss was discovered in a house near Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.It said that her family had been informed, and her body would be returned to Israel.Ms Weiss was kidnapped from her home in Be'eri near the Gaza border.She had been recovering from breast cancer when Hamas launched its deadly attack on 7 October, but was without her medication when she was taken, according to the Bring Them Home Now group.Ms Weiss worked in her kibbutz's kindergartens, managed the dining room and specialised in nursing before she retired, the group said.She was a "loving full-time grandmother", it said, adding she had a love for culture, sports, travelling and baking.Her husband, Shmulik, a rabbi, was killed in the Hamas assault.In a statement, the IDF said that Kalashnikov rifles and rocket-propelled grenades were among the weapons discovered where her body was located."Unfortunately, Yehudit was murdered by terrorists in Gaza and we did not get to her in time," IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a news briefing on Thursday evening.He did not give further details on how she was killed.So far only four of the 240 hostages who were abducted by Hamas last month have been freed.  Israeli officials say that at least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October by hundreds of gunmen.Since Israel started its counter-attack, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 11,400 people have been killed in the territory.Al-Shifa, Gaza City's largest hospital, became the focus of fighting at the start of the week, and was raided by the Israeli military on Wednesday morning.The IDF says Hamas has been using the hospital as a command centre, and has spent two days searching the complex for evidence of this. Hamas denies operating there and the BBC cannot independently verify claims by either side.Currently more than 650 patients, 500 medical staff and over 5,000 displaced people are taking shelter in the hospital. Its director Muhammad Abu Salmiya said conditions were "tragic" at the site, and the hospital has run out of oxygen and water.	
16/11/2023 21:29:00	Al-Shifa Hospital director in Gaza says no water or oxygen left - BBC News	The director of the Gaza Strip's main hospital raided by Israeli soldiers says the facility has now run out of oxygen and water, and patients "are screaming from thirst".Muhammad Abu Salmiya said the conditions were "tragic" in Al-Shifa, where there were more than 650 patients, 500 medical staff and 5,000 displaced people.Israeli tanks were surrounding the hospital in Gaza City, he said, with drones buzzing overhead and Israeli soldiers still moving around inside, as their search of the complex lasted a second day.Israel's army said its operation against Hamas was proceeding in a "discreet, methodical and thorough manner". However a journalist trapped inside the hospital, Khader, told the BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf by phone that Israeli troops were "everywhere, shooting in all directions".The BBC has not been able to independently verify either of the reports.Since the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched their raid on Al-Shifa early on Wednesday, they have released several photos and videos of what they say are Hamas weapons and equipment.On Thursday they said they had found an "operational tunnel shaft and a vehicle containing a large number of weapons".Mr Abu Salmiya said Israeli troops had blown up Al-Shifa's main water line."Sniping operations continue, no-one can move from one building to another, and we have lost communication with our colleagues," he said.Earlier on Thursday, Khader told the BBC that Israeli troops had "stormed all departments", destroying the southern part of the building's wall and dozens of cars.Before Khader's phone line cut off, he also said that armoured bulldozers had been brought in.Gaza's Hamas-controlled health ministry reports that Israeli bulldozers "destroyed parts of the southern entrance" of the medical complex.Israel launched a major military campaign in the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas in retaliation for the 7 October cross-border attack by hundreds of gunmen. Israel considers Hamas a terrorist group, as does the UK, US and European Union.At least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's assault on Israel and about 240 others were taken hostage.Since Israel started its counter-attack, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said at least 11,400 people have been killed in the territory and the UN has warned of a "humanitarian disaster".On Thursday evening, the IDF announced that the body of one of the hostages had been found near Al-Shifa.The IDF identified the victim as Yehudit Weiss, saying she had been kidnapped from her home in Be'eri - a kibbutz in southern Israel.At the same time, there have been reports of a major phone and internet outage in Gaza believed to have been caused by telecom companies running out of fuel supplies.The IDF said their soldiers were continuing their "complex" operation against Hamas at the hospital."Soldiers are proceeding one building at a time, searching each floor, all while hundreds of patients and medical staff remain in the complex," an official said in an update on Thursday evening.The official reiterated the IDF's claim that there was a "well-hidden terrorist infrastructure in the complex".Hamas has repeatedly denied that its fighters have been operating inside the hospital.On Thursday, Osama Hamdan, the most senior Hamas leader in Lebanon, ridiculed the Israeli weapons claims, saying that all the arms had been brought in and planted in the hospital by Israelis.Asked by the BBC why progress on talks to release hostages had failed, he said that on three occasions they had been close to a deal but each time it had been stopped by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The Israeli government has not commented on Mr Hamdan's allegation.In a separate development, Israel has dropped dropped leaflets in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza, warning people in four towns to evacuate their homes and head to shelters.If that is an indication of an upcoming military operation around the southern city of Khan Younis, it could be a real concern to the hundreds of thousands now sheltering there.Before the war, Khan Younis was home to about 300,000 people - a number that has now grown to one million after Israel urged civilians to move south for their safety.	
16/11/2023 19:48:00	Gaza faces communications blackout due to lack of fuel - BBC News	Mobile phone and internet services have gone down across the Gaza Strip due to a lack of fuel for back-up generators, Palestinian telecoms companies say.Telecom firms Paltel and Jawwal said all energy sources sustaining their networks were depleted, and an internet monitor confirmed a major outage.Israel has blocked all but one delivery of fuel to Gaza since the start of its war with Hamas five weeks ago.The UN said a blackout could jeopardise civil order and undermine aid efforts."We regret to announce that all telecom services in Gaza Strip have gone out of service as all energy sources sustaining the network have been depleted, and fuel was not allowed in," Paltel said in a statement on Thursday afternoon.At the same time, internet observatory NetBlocks said live metrics showed Gaza was "in the midst of a major internet outage", with telecom services likely to be unavailable to most residents.Israel launched a major military campaign in the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas, which it considers a terrorist group, in retaliation for the 7 October cross-border attack by hundreds of gunmen. At least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's assault on Israel and about 240 others were taken hostage. Since Israel started its counterattack, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 11,400 people have been killed in the territory and the United Nations has warned of a "humanitarian disaster".The Israeli government has defended blocking fuel deliveries during its campaign, saying it is concerned that Hamas could steal fuel and use it for military purposes.One tanker carrying 23,000 litres of diesel crossed from Egypt on Wednesday, but Israel restricted its use only for the refuelling of UN aid lorries.Other key services have already had to shut down because of similar issues. This includes hospitals, water pumps, desalination plants, sewage treatment facilities and bakeries.The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern city of Khan Younis, confirmed that all communications were down across Gaza on Thursday night. He said it would now be extremely difficult to get any information about what was happening on the ground elsewhere, particularly in places like Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, where Israeli forces were carrying out an operation for a second consecutive day. Before the start of the blackout, a journalist trapped inside the complex had told him by phone that troops were storming all of the hospital's departments and "shooting in all directions". Our correspondent has been unable to re-establish contact since then.The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa - which runs the largest humanitarian operation in Gaza - said he feared the blackout could cause a further breakdown of civil order."These are signs of a situation when you have a blackout and you cannot communicate with anyone anymore... that triggers and fuels even more the anxiety and the panic," Philippe Lazzarini, the UN leader, told a news conference in Geneva."This can provoke or accelerate the last remaining civil order that we have in the Gaza Strip. And if this completely breaks down, we will have difficulties to operate in an environment where you do not have a minimum of order."Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday that a prolonged communications blackout could "provide cover for atrocities and breed impunity while further undermining humanitarian efforts and putting lives at risk".Mr Lazzarini also said that he believed there was a "deliberate attempt to strangle" Unrwa's work in Gaza, warning that the agency might have to entirely suspend its operations if its fuel supplies ran out. Unrwa, which is hosting 813,000 displaced people in its facilities, says it needs at least 160,000 litres of fuel every day to maintain its basic operations. "If the fuel does not come in, people will start to die because of the lack of fuel," Mr Lazzarini warned. "Exactly as from when, I don't know. But it will be sooner rather than later."The head of the UN World Food Programme meanwhile said that supplies of food and water were "practically non-existent" and that "only a fraction of what is needed is arriving through the borders"."With winter fast approaching, unsafe and overcrowded shelters, and the lack of clean water, civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation," Cindy McCain warned. But a spokesman for the Israeli defence ministry body overseeing policy for the Palestinian territories, Cogat, told the BBC: "As far as I know, there is no lack of food and no lack of water in Gaza."Col Moshe Tetro said Israel was fulfilling its obligations to facilitate the delivery of aid and that the number of lorries crossing from Egypt was increasing every day. The UN says 1,139 aid lorries have entered since 21 October, compared to about 500 each day on average before the war.Col Tetro also stressed that Israel was doing everything it could to reduce civilian casualties, including by telling residents in the north of Gaza to flee southwards for their own safety as it focuses its air and ground assault on what it sees as Hamas's stronghold.Many of the 1.5 million displaced people have fled to Khan Younis, where the pre-war population of 300,000 has tripled.On Thursday, there were reports that Israeli forces had dropped leaflets urging people to evacuate four towns east of the city - Bani Shuhaila, Khuzaa, Abasan and Qarara - where tens of thousands of people have been sheltering.An Unrwa spokeswoman said the south had "not been safe at all", and an expansion of Israel's ground assault into the region would be bad news. 	
16/11/2023 18:02:00	Gaza: Belfast-born man confirms his two children will be evacuated - BBC News	A Belfast-born man whose wife and other family members were killed in Gaza has told BBC News NI of his happiness after learning that his children will leave the Palestinian territory.Khalid El-Estal, 30, had appealed for help reuniting with his children after the loss of his family members.His four-year-old son Ali and one-year-old daughter Sara are now included on an evacuation list to leave Gaza.They are due to enter Egypt via the Rafah crossing in the next day.The children are currently situated at the crossing and will travel to Ireland with his brother-in-law, he added."You can't imagine how I felt, I was very happy and excited about that... I was thinking 'what should I bring for the kids?'"I hope they will make it, if not today then please tomorrow," he said. "They have a good chance [in Ireland]."Mr El-Estal was born in Belfast and attended primary school in the Botanic area while his father worked as a lecturer at Queen's University.When he was aged eight, the family relocated to Gaza, where he met his wife, Ashwak Jendia, at university.He told BBC News NI it was a "very long love story" with his "beautiful, talented" wife.Israel began striking Gaza after Hamas's 7 October attacks, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 hostages were taken.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 11,500 people have been killed in the territory since 7 October - of whom more than 4,500 were children.Mr El-Estal was working in Saudi Arabia when his wife was killed along with his mother, brother, uncle and two cousins."Everything was going in the right path, we were expecting to come [to Ireland] together," he said of his wife. "Years of love, happiness... all of it is gone."Mr El Estal said he is now worried for his father and brothers who remain in the Gaza Strip."My brothers are Irish citizens, they didn't want to come to Ireland because they [didn't] want to leave my father and mother, but now it's different."I'm really hoping they can figure something for my father, because he's not Irish, to join me here... I can't imagine leaving my father alone."How can he face all of this, and I am his eldest son? I should be with him."On Wednesday, Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin said 23 Irish citizens had crossed into Egypt from Gaza.He said it was "very welcome news" that some families with children had successfully crossed the Rafah checkpoint.Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÉ, Mr Martin said there is another group of about 40 Irish citizens and dependents due to leave the war zone.On Thursday, the tánaiste travelled to southern Israel, following a visit to Egypt on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters, Mr Martin said three more Irish citizens have managed to cross into Egypt today, which is a lower number than hoped for, due to "processing delays".He also said the Israeli foreign minister, Eli Cohen, has assured him that the majority of Irish citizens remaining in Gaza will be able to exit within the next three days.On Wednesday evening, a motion which called for the expulsion of Israel's ambassador to Ireland was rejected in the the Dáil (Irish lower house of parliament).Meanwhile, in the UK Parliament, MPs voted to reject a call for an immediate ceasefire.Among the Northern Ireland's MPs, the SDLP and Alliance voted in favour and four DUP MPs who were present in the chamber voted against the move.The DUP also voted against a separate Labour amendment which stopped short of calling for a ceasefire.	
16/11/2023 11:12:00	West Berkshire Museum unveils Ancient Egypt animal collection - BBC News	Animal artefacts have been unveiled as part of an exhibition representing life and death in Ancient Egypt. The West Berkshire Museum has a small collection of mummified animal bundles that are now on display in the From the Nile to Newbury collection. The objects were collected at the start of the 20th Century by one of the museum's early curators, Harold Peake.The museum worked with the Thames Valley Ancient Egyptian Society (TVAES) to create the year-long display.Marie-Louise Kerr, curator at West Berkshire Museum, said: "I am very excited to hear what visitors make of it. "We appreciate how fascinating people find the topic of Ancient Egypt."Assistant archaeologist Beth Asbury said: "The ancient Egyptians were keen observers of the natural world. "Depictions have survived of animals, such as giraffes, hippos, monkeys, dogs, cats, frogs, hedgehogs, ducks, cows, crocodiles, baboons, lions, ibises, falcons, rams and fish, for example, as well as imaginary creatures."She added: "People had dogs and cats as pets, and there is evidence that some kings had zoos. "Gods were often represented by animals that reflected elements of their personalities or attributes, such as sky gods being depicted as birds. "Most people were farmers, so keeping livestock, like cattle, was an important aspect of many people's livelihoods."Donnington Grove Vets X-rayed the mummified animals from the museum collection.They found a bird, possibly an ibis, a cat's head and two rodents.The display has two flint tools dating dating from 700,000 BC to circa 6,000 BC and a 2,800-year-old tunic, from about 800 BC, which has muddy footprints, from the time, on the material.The artefacts on display were collected between 1909 and 1946.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

16/11/2023 09:31:00	BBC goes inside Al-Shifa hospital with the Israeli army - BBC News	We clamber into the Al-Shifa hospital complex in darkness over a caved-in wall in the perimeter - knocked through with an armoured bulldozer on Tuesday to allow safer access for Israeli forces.The BBC and one other television crew were the first journalists invited by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to view what Israel says it has found at the site. Any extra light here is risky so we grope our way through the compound, following the heavily armed troops sent to escort us - stepping around makeshift tents, debris and sleeping people. Doctors at the hospital say they have been working without power, food or water for days now - and that critically ill patients have died as a result, including newborn babies. People displaced by the fighting in Gaza have been sheltering in the hospital complex.But Israel says Hamas also runs a network of underground tunnels, including under Al-Shifa hospital.The masked special forces leading us into the building over debris and broken glass are a sign of how tense the situation still is here. Our presence, just a day after Israel took control of the hospital, speaks volumes about Israel's motivation to show the world why they are here. In the brightly lit corridors of the MRI unit, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus shows us three small stashes of Kalashnikovs, ammunition and bullet-proof vests - he says they have found around 15 guns in all, along with some grenades. Lt Col Conricus also shows us some military booklets and pamphlets, and a map that he says is marked with potential entry and exit routes from the hospital.What it tells us, he says, is that Hamas uses hospitals for military purposes. "[And] we uncovered a lot of computers and other equipment which could really shed light on the current situation, hopefully regarding hostages as well."The laptops, he says, contain photos and videos of hostages, taken after their kidnap to Gaza. There is also recently released footage, shared by Israeli police, of their interrogations of Hamas fighters arrested after the October attacks. The BBC was not shown what was on the laptops.This, Lt Col Conricus said, suggested Hamas were here "within the last few days"."At the end of the day, this is just the tip of the iceberg," he said. "Hamas aren't here because they saw we were coming. This is probably what they were forced to leave behind. Our assessment is that there's much more."Israel's army has spent weeks fighting its way to the gates of the hospital. The streets around have seen some of the fiercest fighting in Gaza in the past few days. Our visit was tightly controlled; we had very limited time on the ground and were not able to speak to doctors or patients there. Our journey in to Gaza, in an armoured personnel carrier sealed tight from the darkness outside, traced the path of Israel's first major ground incursions into Gaza weeks ago.On the screens inside the military vehicle, the agricultural land morphed slowly into distorted streets strewn with large pieces of debris, and the blurred outlines of shattered buildings.Just south of Gaza City, we stopped to change vehicles, clambering out on to undulating mounds of twisted metal and large chunks of rubble and concrete.  Small groups of soldiers crouched over tiny campfires, cooking a makeshift dinner beside the rows of tanks. "It's a secret recipe," one winked.  Above them, buildings had collapsed in strange shapes. The rolling metal door of a shopfront hung cramped, halfway open.  A Star of David was scrawled on a wall in red spray-paint; inside it someone had written "IDF", and above it, the words: "Never Again".The attacks of 7 October changed the calculation for Israel in its conflict with Hamas. It has vowed to end years of uneasy standoff, by destroying both the military and political power of Hamas, designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and others.That means going into the heart of Gaza City, including inside Al-Shifa. Israeli forces are still searching for the tunnels beneath the hospital that they believe Hamas fighters may have withdrawn to, perhaps with some of the hostages.This building has become a central focus of Israel's war, described as a key command centre, even potentially the "beating heart" of Hamas operations. And in the brutal information war that tails this conflict, this is Israel's moment of truth.After almost 24 hours securing and searching the hospital, Israel says it has found weapons and other equipment that could help provide information on both Hamas fighters and the hostages. But it has its hands on neither. We leave the hospital, and rumble down the wide avenue that leads to Gaza's coastal road. Gaza City is now ruled by tanks.

16/11/2023 05:04:00	How the dead are counted in Gaza - BBC News	In any warzone, counting the dead is a challenge. Gaza is no different.As battles there intensify, the chaotic situation - with bombardment by Israeli forces, on-the-ground fighting, communications blackouts, fuel shortages and crumbling infrastructure - makes getting accurate information on the numbers of people who have died extremely demanding.And Palestinian officials have said there are now "significant difficulties" in obtaining updated information because of the interruption of communications in the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-run health ministry is Gaza's official source for death numbers - which it updates regularly. On Monday evening, it said 11,240 people had been killed, including 4,630 children, since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October which prompted the current war.The figures have been publicly doubted by Israel. The number of those killed in the attacks in Israel, meanwhile, was initially put at 1,400 by Israeli authorities but was later revised down to about 1,200. US President Joe Biden has said he has "no confidence" in the Gaza statistics. But international organisations, such as the UN's World Heath Organization (WHO), have said they have no reason to disbelieve them.The BBC has been looking in detail at how the casualty figures for Gaza are counted.The health ministry in Gaza reports a regular death total on social media, with an additional breakdown of the number of women, children and the elderly who have been killed. The figures do not give the cause of death, but describe the dead as victims of "Israeli aggression".The ministry also gives figures for the injured and the missing. Some of the bodies remain trapped under piles of rubble, says the Palestinian Red Crescent.Health ministry officials say the death figures are recorded by medical professionals before being passed on to them and the figures only include people recorded dead in hospital. The figures do not distinguish between military and civilian deaths. And, because they do not take into account those who died at the scene of blasts whose bodies have not been found, or buried immediately, they may be an undercount, Gazan officials say.That point was amplified by the Biden administration last week, when a senior US official said the death toll was likely to be greater than the numbers being reported."We think they're very high, frankly," Barbara Leaf, assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, told a House Foreign Affairs Committee, "and it could be that they're even higher than are being cited."It stands in stark contrast to the view of Mr Biden himself, who, on 25 October, said he had "no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed." However, he did not provide any evidence for his scepticism.A day after Mr Biden's dismissal of the numbers, the health ministry in Gaza provided more information, publishing an extensive list of names of all those who had been killed between 7 and 26 October. The list included more than 6,000 full names with their ages, sex and ID numbers. How was it compiled? The BBC has spoken to people involved in gathering and organising the data as well as an academic who has checked for duplicates on the list of names.We have also spoken to an independent research group, Airwars, which is in the process of matching deaths it has investigated to names on the health ministry's list, and the UN - which has assessed death figures in Gaza during previous periods of conflict.Healthcare workers like Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a Médecins Sans Frontières plastic surgeon based in London who has been treating people at hospitals in Gaza City, are key to recording those figures. He says the hospital morgue records deaths after confirming the identity of the dead person with their relatives.The number of deaths registered so far, he believes, is far fewer than those that have actually occurred. "Most of the deaths happen at home," he says. "The ones we could not identify, we did not record."However, once a body is found, it "has to be taken to the hospital to be recorded", says a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent. To examine the health ministry's list, the BBC cross-referenced names included on it with the names of dead people who had appeared in our reporting. One of those deaths the BBC reported was Dr Midhat Mahmoud Saidam, who was killed in a strike on 14 October. The BBC spoke to his former colleagues.Satellite imagery analysis carried out by the BBC showed damage to the area where he lived around the date of his death. An image posted on social media shows a body bag with his name and details written on it.Similar work, but on a larger scale, is being done by Airwars. As part of its work investigating civilian deaths, it has matched names of the dead on the health ministry list with areas that have been bombed. So far, Airwars has found 72 names on the ministry's list in five of the areas it has investigated, including Dr Saidham's.Its investigation also found 23 of his family members had also died and all were recorded on the health ministry list.Scrutinising the statsThe BBC also spoke to the UN and Human Rights Watch - both of which said they had no reason to disbelieve the figures released by the health ministry in Gaza.The UN relies on the health ministry as a source for casualty figures in the area. "We continue to include their data in our reporting, and it is clearly sourced," it said in a statement. "It is nearly impossible at the moment to provide any UN verification on a day-to-day basis."Others who have scrutinised the health ministry's figures include economics professor Michael Spagat, from Royal Holloway, University of London - who chairs the charity Every Casualty Counts which studies death tolls in wars.He says he and a colleague found just one duplicate entry in the health ministry dataset - that of a 14-year-old boy. However, one discrepancy remains hotly contested - that of the death toll after a blast at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City on 17 October. The health ministry said 500 people had been killed, and that figure was later revised down to 471. An assessment by US intelligence was lower, "probably at the low end of the 100-to-300 spectrum". Israel's military cited the al-Ahli figures as the basis for a claim that the Gaza health ministry "continuously inflates the number of civilian casualties." The BBC has made repeated attempts to contact the health ministry in Gaza, but has been unable to get a response so far.Prof Spagat has also looked back at previous conflicts, and found that health ministry figures in Gaza have held up under past scrutiny. In an analysis of health ministry death figures from the Israel-Gaza conflict in 2014, in which Gaza was bombed, and a separate record of death figures from that same year collated by Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem, Prof Spagat found overall consistency in the reported figures. The ministry of health said 2,310 Gazans had been killed in 2014, while B'Tselem counted 2,185 deaths. The UN said 2,251 Palestinians were killed, including 1,462 civilians and Israel's foreign ministry said the 2014 war killed 2,125 Palestinians.Discrepancies such as these are "fairly normal" says Prof Spagat, as some people may have died in hospital for reasons subsequently shown to be unrelated to violence in conflict. Ola Awad-Shakhshir, president of the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, receives regular updates of deaths from Gaza. Ms Awad-Shakhshir says that Israel's interior ministry effectively controls ID numbers for newborn babies born in Gaza and the West Bank - the same ID numbers that appear on the Hamas-run health ministry's register of recorded deaths. The Israeli Population Registry Office holds files that match those in Gaza and the West Bank.When the BBC approached a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces about why they have cast doubt on the Gazan death figures it said the health ministry was a branch of Hamas and that any information provided by it should be "viewed with caution". But it did not provide any evidence of inconsistencies in the data released by the health ministry. We also asked the Israeli prime minister's office about how the numbers of Israelis killed on 7 October by Hamas were recorded. It did not answer that question, however in recent days Israel has revised down the number of people killed during the attack to about 1,200, from the earlier figure of 1,400. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lior Haiat said the revised number was because many bodies were not immediately identified after the attack, and "now we think those belong to terrorists... not Israeli casualties".The Israeli government has not published a detailed list of the civilian casualties although some Israeli media outlets have assembled such lists with names, ages and locations of deaths. Israel's police says more than 850 bodies of civilians have been identified - work is continuing to try to identify remains using specialist forensic techniques.There is a public list of the Israeli soldiers killed so far that includes 48 who have died in the fighting inside Gaza.	
15/11/2023 22:45:00	Al-Shifa: What we know about Israel's raid on Gaza's main hospital - BBC News	The Israeli military has raided Gaza's main hospital in what it describes as a "targeted operation against Hamas".An eyewitness at Al-Shifa hospital told the BBC that troops moved in overnight and were interrogating people. On Wednesday, Israel said it found Hamas' "operational centre" at the hospital, sharing images of what it said were Hamas weapons and equipment.Hamas denies operating there and the BBC cannot independently verify claims by either side.UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said he was "appalled" by the Israeli raid, while the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was "extremely worried" for patients and staff, with whom it had lost contact.The BBC has been speaking to a journalist and a doctor inside the hospital to find out what is happening there, while the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has also been providing updates. Khader, a journalist inside Al-Shifa, told the BBC's Rushdi Abualouf that Israeli troops were in "complete control" of the hospital and no shooting was taking place.He said six tanks and about 100 commandos entered the complex during the night. The Israeli forces then went room to room, questioning staff and patients.The IDF reportedly asked all men aged 16-40 to leave the hospital buildings, except the surgical and emergency departments, and go to the hospital courtyard.Soldiers fired into the air to force those remaining inside to come out, Khader said.However Muhammad Zaqout, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry's director of hospitals, told Al Jazeera that "not a single bullet" had been fired - because "there are no resistors or detainees" inside.Early on Wednesday, the IDF said its forces were in the midst of a "precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area" in the hospital.It said the raid was "based on intelligence information and an operational necessity", calling for the surrender of "all Hamas terrorists" present there.As the soldiers entered the hospital complex, they engaged with a number Hamas members and killed them, the IDF said.On Wednesday evening, the IDF said troops found "an operational command centre, weapons, and technological assets" belonging to Hamas inside the MRI building.It said it was "continuing to operate in the hospital complex", sharing images and videos showing what it said were Hamas weapons.In a seven-minute video, IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus pointed to security cameras that he said had been covered over, and weapons that he said were AK47 rifles hidden behind MRI scanners.The BBC has not yet been able to verify the video or its location.But unless Israel has more to reveal, the military's controversial operation inside the hospital did not net a major arsenal of weapons, reports the BBC's Orla Guerin in Jerusalem.Hamas knew Israel was coming, and therefore, if they were operating beneath the hospital, they would have had weeks to clear out through Gaza's extensive tunnel network, our correspondent adds.Israel's Army Radio reported that troops had not yet found any sign of any of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas during the 7 October attack on Israel, when 1,200 other people were killed.The raid on Al-Shifa came shortly after the US publicly backed Israeli claims that Hamas had infrastructure underneath the hospital. However Dr Ahmed Mokhallalati, a plastic surgeon at Al-Shifa, told the BBC there were only civilians in the hospital.He said there were tunnels under every building in Gaza, including Al-Shifa hospital.According to international humanitarian law, hospitals are specially protected facilities.This means that parties to conflicts cannot attack hospitals, or prevent them performing their medical functions. They can lose their protection if they are used by a party to the conflict to commit an "act harmful to the enemy". The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says this could be something like a hospital being used as a base from which to launch an attack, as a shelter for able-bodied fighters, or to shield a military objective from attack.The IDF said it had repeatedly warned Hamas its "continued military use of Al-Shifa jeopardises its protected status", calling for the evacuation of the hospital before the raid.The WHO had warned that evacuating patients would be a "death sentence", given that the medical system was collapsing.Dr Mokhallalati told the BBC on Wednesday the hospital was without power, oxygen and water. On Tuesday, surgeries had been carried out without proper anaesthesia, with patients "screaming in pain". Doctors were unable to help one patient with burns, and had to just "let him die".Dr Mokhallalati said  six premature babies had died in recent days."Why can't they be evacuated," he said. "In Afghanistan, they evacuated the cats and dogs."The IDF said it was providing incubators, baby food and medical supplies.	
15/11/2023 22:03:00	Pakistan football: The British players starring on the world stage - BBC News	Even the biggest British football fans can probably be forgiven for not knowing the name Harun Hamid.The 19-year-old was released by English second-tier side QPR at the end of last season and currently doesn't play for a professional side.But just last month Harun's name was on the lips of millions of people in Pakistan when he scored the biggest goal in their World Cup qualifying history.His goal was enough to beat Cambodia 1-0 for their first win in five years - putting them through to the second round of qualifying for football's biggest tournament for the first time."I was just filled with adrenaline and had to hit the knee slide in front of the fans," London-born midfielder Harun tells BBC Asian Network.Pakistan's reward for the win is their highest-profile game to date, a match against Saudi Arabia - the only team to beat World Cup winners Argentina at last winter's tournament - at 16:30 GMT on Thursday."We're playing against the team that beat Messi's Argentina and we don't even have a pro league," Harun says.Pakistan has the fifth largest population in the world with about 240 million people, but its football team is ranked a lowly 193rd - one place below the island of Aruba and two above the Seychelles.The fact that it does not have its own professional league, as Harun says, is one of the key reasons that British Pakistani players like him are being called up to play for the national team under dual nationality rules."Growing up I didn't even know Pakistan had a team if I'm honest, so I never thought I'd be playing for them one day," he says."But the opportunity came, and to play on the world stage in front of huge crowds is a dream come true."Hopefully after the win, more young boys like me will consider playing for Pakistan."Harun is not the only British Pakistani player in the squad. His team-mates include former England under-19 captain Easah Suliman and Otis Khan who plays for Grimsby in England's League Two.Another player hoping to be involved in the game against Saudi Arabia is 21-year-old Imran Kayani, who is joining the Pakistan squad for the first time.He grew up in Woking and plays for non-league side Whitehawk FC in Brighton."When the opportunity came, it was an absolute no-brainer," he says."I'm just so excited to get going."The win against Cambodia was a much needed boost for football in Pakistan, after a difficult period which meant they did not play a home match for eight years.National football in the country has also been suspended twice by Fifa in the last four years for "undue influence from third parties".But Imran is confident that British Pakistani players like him can make a difference to their fortunes."A lot more light has been shone on Pakistan football in the last month," he says."There's a lot of British Asian talent in the UK, in the academies. We really want to push Pakistan in a good direction."One of the reasons Pakistan is happy to look to the UK for players is because their manager is Englishman Stephen Constantine.He is known as one of the most accomplished football coaches in Asia - having managed seven national teams, including India twice, in a 20-year career."The difference with India, for example, is they have the Indian Super League," he says. "Players here are struggling to get regular games or even training."The diaspora players do but we're not at a stage yet where we'll have 11 players playing abroad."Pakistan are now in a group with Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Tajikistan in their bid to qualify for the 2026 World Cup.Stephen recently told BBC Sport managing them will be his "hardest challenge" yet, but he is confident he can find the players to build on their historic win."I do have a list of all the players who could play for us and I'm going to travel the world to see them," he says."There is talent here like there is in every country. It's just a case of developing it and going out to find them."And British players like Harun are well aware of what a big opportunity they have been given."It's putting ourselves on the biggest stage. This is what we need to grow as a footballing nation, this is just the start for us hopefully."

15/11/2023 20:36:00	Liverpool couple's anguish after month trapped in Gaza - BBC News	A couple who were trapped in Gaza for a month amid the conflict between Israel and Hamas did not believe they "were going to leave alive". Aladdin and Olfat Sagga, who live Kirkdale, Liverpool, travelled to Gaza to visit family in October. They were in Gaza City when Israel's retaliation began following the 7 October attack by Hamas.The couple said 44 members of their wider families had since been killed in the conflict. Speaking to the BBC at their home in Liverpool, the couple said they were now battling with the mental anguish of what they had witnessed. "I don't feel that I am fine. I need someone to help me because we didn't think for one second that we were going to leave alive out of this war," Mrs Sagga said. "We were pretty desperate."Mr Sagga, 61, said when the bombs started falling "everyone didn't know what to do"."Everyone was just jumping and wanting to take care of their relatives and kids and mothers and sons and families," he said. The couple were in the region to visit Mr Sagga's 97-year-old mother, who they transported with them to Khan Yunis in the south of Gaza when the bombing started. "We were sleeping on the floor; my mother was there my sister was there and we woke up covered in glass and sand," Mr Sagga said. The couple said they travelled seven times to the Rafah crossing into Egypt before they were able to leave.Since returning to Merseyside, they said that they did not know if they would ever be able to return to Gaza.

15/11/2023 13:36:00	First fuel tanker enters Gaza from Egypt since start of war - BBC News	A tanker has delivered fuel to Gaza for the first time since the war between Hamas and Israel began five weeks ago.A senior UN official said it had received 23,000 litres (5,060 gallons) of fuel via Egypt's Rafah crossing.But he warned that Israeli authorities had restricted its use to transporting aid into Gaza, and that none could be used to power hospitals or water pumps.Israel has been blocking all deliveries of fuel, saying it could be stolen by Hamas and used for military purposes.An Israeli defence ministry body said it had agreed to allow UN aid lorries to be refuelled following a request from the US government.The decision came hours after Israeli troops raided Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, which has been the focus of days of fighting and seen nearby air strikes.Israel launched a major military campaign to destroy Hamas - which it classes as a terrorist group - and began a siege of Gaza in retaliation for a cross-border attack by hundreds of gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 11,000 people have been killed in the territory since then and the UN has warned of a "humanitarian disaster".The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa - which runs the largest humanitarian operation in Gaza - said on Tuesday that the lack of fuel meant it could no longer unload or distribute aid from lorries that arrived at Rafah. Although Wednesday's delivery means the UN will now be able to fill up its vehicles, Israel has banned it from using any of the fuel to provide basic services to 1.5 million people who have fled their homes, more than half of which are sheltering in Unrwa facilities."Our entire operation is now on the verge of collapse," Unrwa's Commissioner General, Philippe Lazzarini, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. "By the end of today, around 70% of the population in Gaza won't have access to clean water," he added. "To have fuel for trucks only will not save lives anymore. Waiting longer will cost lives."The agency's Gaza chief, Thomas White, said 23,000 litres represented only 9% of what it needed daily to sustain life-saving activities and demanded that aid "be delivered based upon need - not based upon conditions set by parties to a conflict". Earlier, Mr White said all three sewage pumps and 10 water pumps in the southern town of Rafah had stopped working because they had run out of fuel, as had the desalinisation plant in the nearby city of Khan Younis.Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis has also been forced to halt all services except for emergencies and 24 ambulances have been taken out of service.Many other health, water and sanitation facilities have already been forced to shut down across the Strip due to lack of fuel, damage, attacks and insecurity. Palestinian telecommunications firms have also said that they expect to switch off phone and internet services on Thursday due to a lack of fuel for data centres and exchanges, according to the UN.The Netblocks internet observatory said on Wednesday that metrics showed a new gradual decline in internet connectivity in Gaza and that residents' ability to communicate was likely to be reduced.On Tuesday, 91 lorries carrying food, medicines, health supplies, bottled water, blankets, tents and hygiene products entered Gaza from Egypt, the UN said, bringing the total since the Rafah crossing reopened on 21 October to 1,187.The UN has described that as a "drop in the ocean", noting that about 500 lorries would cross into Gaza each day on average before the war began.	
15/11/2023 12:59:00	Bowen: Al-Shifa Hospital raid comes as tone shifts on Israel - BBC News	Al-Shifa is the main hospital in Gaza City - I've been there many times. It has big grounds, so people in Gaza went there to seek shelter and camp out as they saw it as a safe area. It has now become a symbol of the juxtaposition of the war - the Israeli invasion of Gaza inflicting masses of casualties and damage, set against the crisis of urgent humanitarian need inside the hospital.The Israelis have made a very big point about saying that, as well as going after the Hamas military command, they have brought in some fuel and incubators, because there has been a very concerning claim that premature babies in Al-Shifa Hospital had to be taken out of their incubators. However, the issue isn't a lack of incubators, it's a lack of fuel. Until Wednesday, Israel hadn't allow fuel into the Gaza Strip because they argued that Hamas would steal it and use it.Some 23,000 litres (5,060 gallons) of fuel has now been allowed in, but it is only to be used to refuel UN lorries. The UN says the delivery comprises only a fraction of what's needed for humanitarian operations, and the entry of fuel to run generators at hospitals and at water and sanitation facilities remains banned.Israel says Hamas has stockpiles of its own, and that it should use that fuel for the generators supplying the hospital electrical system. So there are a lot of strands coming together in what's unfolding in Al-Shifa Hospital this morning, but that's not the whole war - it will continue once this particular operation is over. At the same time, we have seen a hardening of the international position around the Israeli offensive in the last few days with the US, the UK and France using language that is shifting the tone - perhaps summed up best by what US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last weekend: "Far too many" Palestinian civilians have been killed.The Israelis knew this shift would come because this is a repeat of the pattern we have seen many times before with Israel's military operations. They talk about different clocks running during any operation. One is military: how long do they need before they accomplish their military objectives? The other is diplomatic: how long does Israel hold legitimacy to carry out that operation before its allies say, "you've killed enough people, civilians, you need to stop now please."Israel feels that because of the absolute enormity of the numbers of casualties in the Hamas attacks on 7 October, they have more time than usual, and I think they have gone in - as we can see from the levels of casualties in Gaza - using a great deal of force. I have seen some estimates that suggest the Israel Defense Forces will continue to work in this way for a couple more weeks, but I think the forces are gathering among their allies to say you need to change the nature of your military operation. That doesn't necessarily translate to a call for this to stop - certainly we haven't yet heard a call for a ceasefire from the British or the Americans.	
15/11/2023 11:22:00	Israel Gaza war: History of the conflict explained - BBC News	The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.About 1,200 people were killed, while the Israeli military says more than 200 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 14,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Britain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a "national home" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the "Catastrophe"By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.In a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.There are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: Israel-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called "the deal of the century" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.	
15/11/2023 06:00:00	Hostages' fates haunt Israel as war intensifies - BBC News	Their smiling faces look down from the sides of skyscrapers, walls between Tel Aviv's restaurants and bars and a giant video screen at a shopping mall entrance.More than 240 hostages were snatched at gunpoint on 7 October from their homes or workplaces next to the Gaza Strip, from military bases and a big outdoor dance party.They included some 30 children, the youngest just nine months old. But since Hamas gunmen spirited them away to Gaza, the fates of most remain unknown.For Israelis reeling from last month's bloody massacres, it is an ongoing trauma. "This is the last photo we have of my aunt. She was taken on a motorcycle by two terrorists," says Eyal Nouri, showing me a picture of Amina Moshe, 72, being driven away from Nir Oz, a kibbutz where she lived for 50 years.  "No children, no babies, no older women are meant to be part of any conflict. It's something against humanity to kidnap children."  Although this is the biggest, over the years, Israel has endured many hostage crises.During the 1980s, the country showed it was ready to pay high prices for its citizens in prisoner swaps with Palestinian and Lebanese armed groups. Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, who later founded Hamas, was freed in one exchange.  Even Israeli soldiers' corpses were traded to give them proper Jewish burials. Then in 2006, Hamas kidnapped a soldier, 19-year-old Gilad Shalit, in a cross-border raid. His father, Noam, led a painful five-year campaign to bring him home, stressing the "unwritten contract" between the state and its conscripts.Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister - then as now - signed off on the biggest ever prisoner exchange for a single soldier. More than a thousand inmates were released including Yahya Sinwar, who went on to lead Hamas in Gaza, and apparently masterminded the 7 October attacks.A key figure involved in the Shalit deal sees major differences between the circumstances then and now which he thinks will prevent any comprehensive deal being done.  "We had five years and four months to build trust with Gilad Shalit. [Now], we have days. The future of the hostages will be decided in the coming days," says Gershon Baskin, an Israeli peace activist, who led secret backchannel talks with Hamas.The main complication this time, he says, is the scale of atrocities.  "What Hamas did, they crossed the line, where it's inconceivable that they will continue to be in power in Gaza after this war is over," Mr Baskin says. "So, there's some kind of built in contradiction to trying to negotiate with the people that you intend on killing."Early on, Qatar did broker the release of an American Israeli mother and daughter and Egypt helped bring out two older Israeli women hostages. However, no bigger agreement has since taken shape.This week, the military wing of Hamas said it was ready to free up to 70 women and children held in Gaza in exchange for a five-day ceasefire.Speaking to the US network, NBC on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu raised the possibility of a deal. The US President Joe Biden has since said he is engaged in daily discussion to secure the release of the hostages and believes it will happen.However, publicly, Israel has rejected a ceasefire, arguing that Hamas would use it to regroup. It has said it could agree to shorter humanitarian pauses in hostilities.Polls suggest that position is supported by many Israelis. In the latest survey by the Israeli Democracy Institute, the most common response - from 38% of people - was that Israel should negotiate a prisoner deal but continue fighting. Overall, 70% of respondents did not think the war should stop."In return for the hostages they are ready to give Palestinian prisoners. But the popular view is to say: "don't stop the fighting,"" says Professor Tamar Hartmann who conducted the poll. "It's because the cost of stopping the fighting right now might be greater in terms of people's lives, if we stop and the aims of the war will not be achieved."A persistent small group of those polled - about a fifth - refuse any deal making with Hamas. Many Israelis point out how in the past, prisoners - like Yahya Sinwar - who already had blood on their hands were released and went on to plot further deadly attacks.With the odds against them, families and supporters of the hostages are coming up with creative ways of raising public pressure.A huge art installation filling HaBima Square in Tel Aviv features an empty bed for every adult, child and couple missing in Gaza. Every Friday on the Jewish sabbath, relatives gather in what is now known as Hostages Square outside the Museum of Art. They set up a giant table with places set for every person missing.On Tuesday, a large crowd began a 40 mile (63 km) march from Tel Aviv to the prime minister's office in Jerusalem to urge their government to take action.  With each passing day, fears grow for the hostages. Hamas says several dozen have already been killed in Israeli air strikes.  Past experience has taught Israelis that deals can be done but now the intensity of the ongoing war brings a new level of urgency.

15/11/2023 03:10:00	US evangelicals drive Republican support for Israel - BBC News	Republican support for Israel has been near monolithic since the 7 October attack by Hamas. Conservatives argue the US is backing a close ally, standing up for the region's only democracy and sending a message that terror against civilians will not be tolerated.But there's more to it than that.Evangelical conservatives are a key part of the Republican party's coalition, and these religious voters - and politicians - have a connection to the state of Israel that runs deep.George Washington University religious scholar Christopher Rollston says: "There's a strong sense within evangelicalism that the Jewish people are God's people. "And there's a theological assumption that's pretty pervasive within certain segments of evangelicalism that the establishment of the modern state of Israel was the fulfilment of biblical prophecy."The new Republican Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, has strong evangelical ties.The Louisiana congressman was one of a handful of politicians who addressed a crowd organisers estimated as being in the hundreds of thousands at a "March for Israel" event in Washington DC on Tuesday. Quoting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he called the conflict between Israel and Hamas "a fight between good and evil, between light and darkness, between civilisation and barbarism".He said demands for an Israeli ceasefire in Gaza were "outrageous"."It is my hope that this gathering today serves as a reminder to the entire world, but also to those within our own borders, that the United States stands proudly with Israel and the Jewish people forever," he said.Mr Johnson stood on a stage bedecked with dozens of Israeli and American flags, the US Capitol in the background. Two senior Democrats, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, joined him, along with Republican Senator Joni Ernst.They raised their hands together and led the audience in a chant of "we stand with Israel"."There are few issues in Washington that could so easily bring together leaders of both parties in both chambers," Mr Johnson said, "but the survival of the state of Israel unites us together and unites all Americans."The Democrats are divided, however. While the two congressional leaders, along with President Joe Biden, have been firm in their support for Israel following the attack, a growing number on the left are calling attention to Palestinian civilian casualties and condemning the Israeli military campaign.With the exception of a handful of Republican politicians, however, dissent on the right has been missing.When a standalone bill providing $14.3bn (£11.5bn) in US aid to Israel was introduced in the House of Representatives, only two Republicans - Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky - voted no.Their isolated opposition is a far cry from the significant and growing number of Republicans who oppose continued US support for Ukraine, the world's other current major international conflict. The influence of an evangelical leader invited to speak towards the end of the March for Israel's programme helps explain why Israel is treated differently by Republicans. John Hagee is a Texas-based Christian minister and president of Christians United for Israel, which boasts 10 million members.In 2008, he said the Holocaust was part of God's plan to return Jews to Israel. The Republican presidential candidate at the time, John McCain, declined his endorsement in part because of those comments.The organisers of Tuesday's march, the Jewish Federations of North America and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, invited Mr Hagee to speak at their rally, however, as a part of a "voices of allies" segment. The organisers did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.For his part, Mr Hagee was effusive in his support for Israel. He told the crowd that a line should be drawn uniting Christians and Jews and that there was no "middle" ground in the conflict between Israel and Hamas."We must all stand united with one voice and boldly declare over and over: Israel, you are not alone," he said.In his deep southern preacher drawl, he placed the fate of Israel squarely in a religious context."The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob guarantees Israel's deliverance will come as proclaimed every year during Passover," he said. "Israel is the apple of God's eye. Israel is the shining city on the hill. God says of Israel, Israel is my firstborn son."For some evangelicals, however, the ties between their religion and the fate of Israel have a darker hue. And it's where Mr Hagee's more controversial views come into play. In the End Days, a certain strain of Christian theology holds, the Jewish people will either convert to Christianity or perish in flames. It is a key step towards Armageddon that is then followed by 1,000 years of peace, according to this belief.A Pew Research survey last year found 39% of Americans - including 63% of evangelicals - believe humanity is "living in the end times".And for the moment - on the stage in Washington on Tuesday and in the halls of Congress - the interests of Israel, Republicans and evangelicals are in alignment.	
15/11/2023 01:44:00	Israeli-Canadian peace advocate Vivian Silver confirmed killed in Hamas attack - BBC News	An Israeli-Canadian peace advocate, feared to have been taken hostage in Gaza, has been confirmed killed.Vivian Silver, 74, lived close to Israel's border with Gaza in kibbutz Be'eri - which was attacked by Hamas during the 7 October attacks.Remains had been found earlier at her house, but they were only formally identified as hers five weeks later.Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly described Ms Silver as a "lifelong advocate for peace"."Canada mourns her loss," she wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.Ms Silver, born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was one of Israel's best known advocates for peace with the Palestinians. Her movement, Women Wage Peace, was established to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to reach a peace agreement to end the Arab-Israeli conflict.Her son Yonatan Zeigen told the BBC she stayed busy in her retirement, continuing her life's work as an activist, holding meetings just days before the Hamas attacks.Her family had believed she had been kidnapped by Hamas and held in Gaza for the past five weeks.Speaking to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation last week, Mr Zeigen said that while they knew Ms Silver's house had been burned to the ground during Hamas's attack, and that a body had been found at that time, there was "no evidence there of a struggle or bullets", leading the family to believe she had been kidnapped.In an interview with the BBC in the days after the attack, Mr Zeigen recounted his final communications with her as she hid in a cupboard while armed men were moving through the kibbutz.He said his mother told him that she loved him, and said "'they're inside the house, it's time to stop joking and say goodbye.'""I wrote back that 'I love you, Mum. I have no words, I'm with you,'" he said."Then she writes, 'I feel you.' And then that was it, that's the last message."Asked what his mother would have said about everything that has happened, Mr Yonatan said: "That this is the outcome of war. Of not striving for peace, and this is what happens.""It's very overwhelming but not completely surprising. It's not sustainable to live in a state of war for so long and now it bursts. It bursts."Gershon Baskin, a friend of Silver's, remembered her as a "happy, optimistic person". "She was a person who lit up a room whenever she came in," he told CBC. "She had a moral compass that led the direction of many people who followed her."More than 100 members of Ms Silver's kibbutz were killed in the attack. There have been growing calls for a humanitarian pause to allow aid into Gaza, and to help get out some of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas.Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu has said all hostages must be released before any temporary truce can be agreed.Israel began striking Gaza after Hamas's surprise attacks, in which 1,200 people were killed. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza since.	
14/11/2023 23:58:00	Israel-Gaza War: Some Irish citizens could leave Gaza on Wednesday - BBC News	Some Irish citizens may be able to leave Gaza on Thursday, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DfA) has said.Hundreds of foreign passport holders have already crossed the Rafah border into Egypt since the Israel-Gaza war started.It is understood these would be the first Irish citizens to leave the warzone.Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Micheál Martin is flying to Egypt on Tuesday night on a trip to the Middle East in which he will also travel to Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.A spokesperson for the DfA said it "understands that some Irish citizens may be listed for a departure from Gaza tomorrow". "We continue to remain in contact with our citizens in Gaza as this complex situation evolves," the statement added.On Tuesday night the Dáil (lower house of the Irish parliament) debated a Sinn Féin motion calling for Israel to be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) over its actions in Gaza.The government said it would not back the motion, noting an ICC investigation into the situation in the Palestinian territories - including Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem - was opened in March 2021 and will cover recent events.Speaking for government, Sean Fleming, a minister of state at the DfA, said ministers had decided earlier on Tuesday to make a voluntary contribution of €3m (£2.6m) to the ICC.He said that contribution is in response to the "urgent need of the court".What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and what is Hamas?Israel-Gaza war: History of the conflict explainedThe government will now table a counter motion, Mr Fleming added, which "clearly expresses Ireland’s unwavering support for the vital work of the International Criminal Court".Sinn Féin TD Chris Andrews accused the government of "double standards", saying it joined 37 other countries in referring a case against Russia to the court in 2022.Voting on both motions is to take place on Wednesday.Earlier on Tuesday Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris told the Dáil that what Hamas did was despicable and Israel had a right to defend itself.However he said Israel was now involved in a "war on children" and was "blinded by rage".Meanwhile, the Irish government has pledged to do "all in its power" to secure the release of an Irish-Israeli girl who is believed to be a hostage of Hamas in Gaza.On Tuesday President Michael D Higgins met the father and the sister of Emily Hand at Áras an Uachtaráin, his official residence.Also present were the Israeli ambassador to Ireland and relatives of other Israeli hostages.Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar met Dublin-born Tom Hand and his daughter Natali on Monday.Emily, who is eight, was initially believed to have been killed in an assault on a kibbutz during Hamas's attack in southern Israel on 7 October.But her family were later told she was likely to be alive and held hostage.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Varadkar reiterated his government's call for Hamas to release all hostages immediately.He said he would continue to raise the issue through any "avenues which may help". "I also used the opportunity of the meeting with the Israeli ambassador to raise the issue of Irish-Palestinian dual citizens in Gaza who have asked to leave the territory," he added. Mr Varadkar had previously said they are about 40 Irish citizens in Gaza.Earlier in November, Mr Varadkar raised Emily's case with a number of representatives of Arab states.Assistance for Irish citizens who want to leave Gaza was also discussed at the meetings in Paris.Emily Hand was in Kibbutz Be'eri, about three miles from Gaza, when Hamas launched its attack.More than 100 people were killed in the kibbutz.They were among more than 1,400 Israelis killed by Hamas in attacks across southern Israel.Dozens of other people from the kibbutz are still missing and it is believed some of them may have been taken to Gaza as hostages.At the last count, the Israeli Defense Forces said 242 people were being held hostage by Hamas.Since the Hamas attacks of 7 October, Israel has been carrying out military operations in Gaza from land, sea and air, with troops and tanks now in the territory.Gaza's health ministry, which is run by Hamas, says more than 11,000 people have been killed in the Israeli action, more than 4.500 of whom were children.Hostages: Children must be off limits, says father of abducted kidsFrom Gaza: Giving birth with no painkillers under the bombsExplained: Israel-Gaza - why this war is different to the othersWatch: Ros Atkins on...

14/11/2023 22:04:00	Israel-Gaza war: US says Hamas has command centre under Al-Shifa hospital - BBC News	The US says it has intelligence that Hamas has a command centre under Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.National Security spokesman John Kirby said the group stored arms there and were prepared for an Israeli attack.This is the first time the US has independently backed claims by close ally Israel that Hamas uses hospitals to hide its bases. Hamas denies this.The statement came as Israel faced mounting global pressure to protect civilians trapped in the hospitals.US President Joe Biden said that Al-Shifa hospital "must be protected" from intense fighting around the complex, and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Israel must act within international law.The area around Al-Shifa, Gaza's biggest hospital, has become the focus of fighting in recent days. Thousands of people are believed to be sheltering there.Mr Kirby said the US had its own intelligence, which had come from a variety of sources, suggesting that Hamas and Islamic Jihad used hospitals in the Gaza Strip and tunnels underneath them to conceal military operations and hold hostages.Previously the US administration had only cited open-source intelligence and would not confirm that it had its own sources for this."Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad members operate a command and control node from Al-Shifa in Gaza City," he said. "They have stored weapons there and they are prepared to respond to an Israeli military operation against that facility."Mr Kirby said this showed how challenging the Israeli operation was as "Hamas has deeply embedded itself within the civilian population"."To be clear, we do not support striking a hospital from the air and we do not want to see a firefight in the hospital where innocent people, helpless people, sick people are simply trying to get the medical care that they deserve, not to be caught in a crossfire. Hospitals and patients must be protected," he said."As we have been clear on multiple occasions, Hamas's actions do not lessen Israel's responsibility to protect civilians in Gaza, and this is obviously something we're going to have an active conversation with our counterparts about."Responding to the White House's remarks on Tuesday, Hamas said in a statement reported by the AFP news agency that Israel would use Washington's assessment to give it a "green light" to commit "brutal massacres" against medical facilities, "destroying Gaza's healthcare system and displacing Palestinians".Doctors inside Al-Shifa say that dozens of people, including at least three premature babies, have died due to a lack of fuel, medicine and power. They have told the BBC that more than 100 bodies lay unburied in courtyards, and anyone trying to leave the complex - or even move between buildings - risks death due to the violence in the area.Israel maintains that it has not fired directly on hospitals in Gaza despite what it says is Hamas's presence in them. The Israeli military has vowed to destroy Hamas, a designated terror group in the US, UK and EU, in the Gaza Strip.On Monday Israel released video of what it said was a Hamas hideout under the Rantisi children's hospital in northern Gaza City.In a six-minute video marked as "raw footage", the IDF's chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari is seen saying he is at a tunnel 200 metres away from Rantisi. In the video, Hagari points to the tunnel entrance, which he says he believes is "connected" to the hospital, and electrical wiring he says proved solar panels had been powering a bunker. No further evidence is provided for the existence of a command centre but the IDF spokesman said investigations were continuing.The footage then cuts to basement rooms he says are inside Rantisi hospital. He points to a cache of weapons, including explosive belts and grenades, and a motorcycle with what he says is bullet damage.Rear Adm Hagari says there are signs that hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the group's attack on Israel had been held in the basement.A shot shows a chair with what appears to be rope ties, below a control panel marked "World Health Organization" with a child's feeding bottle resting on top.In another room, he points to a calendar on the wall counting the days in Arabic from 7 October - the date of Hamas's attack into southern Israel.Rear Adm Hagari claims the calendar shows the "terrorists' shifts" as they guarded the room. He says names were written alongside shift times.The top of this document mentions the "al-Aqsa flood" - Hamas's codename for the 7 October attacks. However, the Arabic words translate to the days of the week, not names. He separately states that the room is decorated with curtains like a video studio. Of the hostage videos released by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, none have shown a matching pattern in the background. The IDF escorted CNN journalists around the site and the hospital, which was evacuated on Friday. BBC News has not visited the site and is not able to independently verify any of the allegations made by Hagari.However, the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza responded in detail to the Israeli claims, describing them as a "theatrical farce".It said the underground space shown in the video was used for administration and storage, and as a shelter from air strikes.It described the display of weapons as staged, and said there were thousands of similar motorcycles in Gaza.The ministry says that more than 11,000 people have been killed in Israel's operations against Hamas, since the group killed 1,200 people in Israel on 7 October and took about 240 people hostage.Additional reporting by BBC Verify's Paul Brown.	
14/11/2023 17:42:00	British man killed by Hamas was due to leave kibbutz, brother says - BBC News	A British man killed in a Hamas attack on an Israeli kibbutz was meant to have left but stayed "one more day" in a place he considered a "little piece of heaven", his brother has said.Daniel Darlington, 34, originally from Manchester, was killed at the Nir Oz kibbutz in the 7 October massacre.His brother Lior Peri told the BBC Mr Darlington was an "amazing free sprit" who was the "cool uncle" in his family. He said his focus now was to bring his 79-year-old hostage father home.The UK government has confirmed 12 British nationals were killed in Hamas's attack last month. A further three are missing.Mr Darlington, a photographer, had been living in Berlin and was visiting friends in Israel when Hamas struck.Mr Peri said it was by "complete chance" his half-brother was in the kibbutz when Hamas arrived. He said: "He stayed in the kibbutz one more day. "He was supposed to come back to us in Tel Aviv and he was so happy to announce to me that he found a ride the next day so he could stay one more day in this little piece of heaven he liked so much."That's where it ended unfortunately."Mr Peri said his father Haim, a lifelong peace activist, was among those taken hostage in the attack. "He has been a farmer all his life and an enthusiastic peace activist," he said. "I get my hope from the belief that I will see my father alive and well again. It's the only thing keeping me and all of us up and running," he said. Mr Peri said the operation to rescue the hostages now needed to be the "first priority"."We've started calling more on the Israeli government to persuade us that they are doing whatever they can to release the hostages, since we don't really have the confidence that they are doing whatever is needed," he said."They are continuing the ground invasion. We can't know if this pressure applying on Hamas is helping us in the hostage situation or is it pushing us further away."More than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Forty-six Israeli soldiers have been killed, the Israel Defence Force has said.Four hostages have been released and the IDF has rescued one.

14/11/2023 16:12:00	Arab and Muslim leaders blame West for Gaza misery - BBC News	Hypocrisy, double standards and a failure to understand the region. These are the charges being levelled at the West, primarily the US, by leaders of 57 Arab and Muslim countries who convened at the weekend in the Saudi capital Riyadh.How is it, foreign ministers said to me, that the West slams Russia for killing civilians in Ukraine, yet, in their words, it "gives a green light to Israel to do the same in Gaza"? In the luxurious surroundings of Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel, amid giant floral bouquets and glittering chandeliers, and a world away from the shattered landscape of Gaza, princes, presidents and prime ministers met for the Joint Arab Islamic Extraordinary Summit.Blame for the war and the destruction of lives and property was heaped unilaterally on Israel and its supporters. No-one criticised Hamas for its 7 October raid into southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw some 240 taken hostage, triggering the massive military retaliation. Israel, said the secretary general of the Arab League, had committed criminal acts."We warn of the disastrous repercussions of the retaliatory aggression by Israel against the Gaza Strip, which amounts to a war crime," said the final communique. "We warn of the real danger of the expansion of the war as a result of Israel's refusal to stop its aggression and of the inability of the [UN] Security Council to enforce international law to end this aggression." Few people I spoke to at the summit expected Israel to take much notice. Instead, it was clear that this summit and its intended message of unity was aimed at Israel's biggest backer - the United States. Leaders want the Biden administration and the West in general to exert sufficient pressure on Israel to stop the war altogether.But what they could not agree on was how to achieve that. The summit pulled together some strange bedfellows - an indication of just how worried the region is at events in Gaza spiralling beyond their control. Iran - Israel's main adversary - attended, with President Ebrahim Raisi striding across the carpeted halls in his black, cleric's robes, flanked by his scowling security men in dark suits and collarless shirts. This in itself was a surprising sight. Until they patched over their differences in March this year, Saudi Arabia and Iran were arch rivals exchanging venomous mutual accusations. They still have competing agendas, with Iran backing what many call its "proxy militias" - Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. The Saudis, together with their conservative Arab allies like Egypt and Jordan, see these movements as dangerous destabilisers.As he departed Tehran airport for Riyadh, President Raisi said that now was the time for action over Gaza, not words. But anyone expecting concrete, punitive actions against the US or the UK was left disappointed. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which only recently opened full diplomatic, trade and security ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, resisted calls to break them off.Syria's President Bashar al-Assad was also at the summit. Until very recently he was a pariah in the Arab world for the repressive actions of his regime in Syria's civil war. He told the summit it would achieve little without concrete measures, but suggestions of an oil embargo or the expulsion of US bases from Arab countries were quietly batted away.Yet there is no denying that the 7 October Hamas raid and the ensuing war has changed the whole paradigm in the Middle East.Up until that murderous morning in southern Israel the tectonic plates of regional politics were shifting away from the interests of Iran and its militant allies. Six Arab nations had already established full ties with Israel; Saudi Arabia was well on the way to being next. The Israeli tourism minister visited Riyadh just days before the Hamas raid. Dubai has been luring Israeli tourists in large numbers and there has been a huge Arab appetite for Israel's expertise in technology, surveillance, bio-tech and other sectors.With the exception of Qatar, which hosts the exiled political leaders of Hamas, Gulf Arab rulers had grown tired of what they saw as the corruption, inefficiency and infighting of Palestinian leadership. While sympathetic to the plight of ordinary Palestinians, still without a state after 75 years, they largely took the view that Israel was too important a nation to ignore, and that it was time to move on and normalise ties with it. The question of a future Palestinian state, while still featuring in speeches, was getting little practical attention.Today, those Arab-Israeli ties, while not yet broken, are certainly fraying at the edges. "We are really worried about the radicalisation of our youth," one Arab foreign minister told me on background. "They watch what is happening in Gaza on TV and they are increasingly angry." Time and again I heard delegates complain that the actions of the Netanyahu government have gone far beyond self-defence and are now dragging the region down a dangerous path. There are concerns that extremist narratives are gaining popularity online.Arab and Muslim leaders are frustrated that the UN Security Council has failed in their eyes to exercise any restraint on Israel's military in Gaza. America's opposition to a ceasefire has deeply embarrassed those countries it calls allies in the region. Washington's strategic alliance with the oil-rich Gulf Arab states dates back to 1945 and a wartime meeting on a US warship in the Red Sea between President Roosevelt and the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz. Today, the US still provides the bulk of Saudi and Gulf Arab defence and security needs.But below the surface things are changing. Ever since the Obama administration's "pivot to Asia" there has been a fear here in the Gulf that the US is losing interest in the region, that it cannot be relied upon as a loyal partner. At the same time, the influences of Moscow and Beijing are in the ascendant. China recently brokered the rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia. President Putin has impressed Arab leaders with his unstinting support for Syria's President Assad. They compare this with how quickly Washington abandoned Egypt's President Mubarak in 2011 when the crowds came out on Cairo's Tahrir Square.None of this means the West has lost the friends it had in the Middle East. Those Arab allies are clearly reluctant to go beyond angry words with Washington. But they do want to be heard and for the violence in Gaza to stop now, before events in the region and in their own countries risk deteriorating far beyond their control.	
14/11/2023 14:27:00	US and Canada missing and dead in Israel attack: A musician, a soldier, and a father - BBC News	Deborah Matias and her husband Shlomi died protecting their son from gunmen who broke into their home. They are among 31 Americans and seven Canadians known to have been killed in the Hamas attacks."She was so full of life," said her father, Ilan Troen in a BBC interview. "She could have become a doctor but she once said to me 'Dad, I have to do music because it's in my soul."His daughter, a 50-year-old musician from Missouri, and her husband fell on top of their 16-year-old son Rotem after their kibbutz near the border with Gaza came under attack.They were shot and killed but the teenager lay hidden and injured for hours while his grandfather Ilan texted him reassurances. Hamas has abducted more than 200 people, according to Israel, and a number of them are from North America. Two US nationals were released on 20 October - Natalie and Judith Raanan.These are the stories of Americans and Canadians confirmed by the BBC or credibly reported as missing, or dead.Last updated on 14 November 2023 at 09:20 ETItay Chen, 19, is serving with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and had elected to work at his base on the Gaza border last weekend to get time off for his brother's upcoming bar mitzvah.  On Saturday he told his family that base was under attack. They soon lost communication.  "No one has been able to physically locate him - he is not in hospital, not on the deceased list," his father Ruby Chen, who grew up in New York, said at a press conference, adding that Itay is considered Missing In Action. Omer Neutra, 21, from Long Island in New York, also served with the Israel Defense Forces. His parents told the New York Times that he told them things seemed calm at first from his post in southern Israel. But they have not heard from him since the attack began and believe he was kidnapped by Hamas.Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, was last seen fighting off attackers at Kibbutz Nir Oz, where he lived with his pregnant wife and two daughters. He has not been heard from since. His father Jonathan. a professor at Hebrew University, is from Connecticut. He said there are only 160 known survivors out of the 400 people living at the kibbutz.Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, from California, was at the Nova festival. Witnesses saw him loaded onto a truck by Hamas militants, his family told the Los Angeles Times. He was badly injured, the witnesses said. His parents told the Jerusalem Post they received two messages from him, reading "I love you" and "I'm sorry". His phone was last located on the Gaza border. His family says that told them his arm was seriously injured and he was able to fashion a tourniquet.Edan Alexander, 19, is an IDF soldier who recently graduated from Tenafly High School in New Jersey. The office of New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said they believe he is classified as Missing in Action.  He was serving with the Golani Brigade near the Gaza border.Judith Weinstein Haggai, 70, was on a routine morning stroll with her husband on 7 October when Hamas missiles and gunfire ripped through the sky. Ms Haggai captured some of the scene in a short 40-second video and shared it in a group chat, her last contact with family. Ms Haggai's daughter, Iris Weinstein Haggai, told the Times of Israel that her dad "was wounded really bad" but that paramedics had lost contact with her parents.Vivian Silver, 74, was a well-known Israeli-Canadian peace advocate who was thought to be missing for weeks but was later identified as deceased. Her home close to the Gaza border in kibbutz Be'eri was burned to the ground during the 7 October attack. Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly described Ms Silver as a "lifelong advocate for peace".Netta Epstein, 21, an Israeli-Canadian who jumped on a grenade to save his girlfriend. According to his family and friends, Hamas militants fired on and threw grenades into his apartment's safehouse. When one landed near his girlfriend, he jumped on it. She survived and was rescued by Israeli soldiers later.Roey Weiser, 21, served with the Israel Defense Forces and rushed to defend his military base in southern Israel with fellow soldiers when the attack started. "They managed to fend off a bunch of terrorists," his mother Naomi told the BBC. "Roey even managed to kill one or two and then he died himself." He had worked at the Kerem Shalom Gaza border crossing, where trucks entered the Gaza strip from Israel and Egypt, according to the Jerusalem Post.Laor Abramov, 20, is a New Jersey DJ who moved to Israel during the Covid pandemic. He was attending the Tribe of Nova music festival that was attacked and took refuge in a nearby bomb shelter. His parents told CBS News that he texted them, saying  "I have to be quiet".  A few days later his father confirmed his death on Facebook.Itay Glisko, 20, born in New Jersey who was serving in the IDF. His family says he fought for hours against the Hamas attack on his military base.Ben Mizrachi, a 22-year-old from Vancouver, was attending the Nova music festival that turned deadly. He was remembered by an administrator at King David High School as a "caring big brother" who loved Israel.Lotan Abir, 24, was also attending the Nova festival, with two people he knew from a Utah group for young Jewish professionals. He moved to Utah less than a year ago, and was a DJ and musician, as well as handyman.Adrienne Neta, 66, grew up in California. She was sitting on her front porch at the kibbutz where she lived when the attack began. She took shelter while on the phone with her two sons and daughter. "The terrorist barged into her home," her son Nahal has said. "We heard a little bit of screaming and that was our last contact with her." Israel's government has confirmed her death, her family has told media outlets.Alexandre Look, 33, of Montreal, was killed at the Nova festival. He made a video call to his mother, who could hear screaming in the background. He hid in a bunker with about 30 people and survivors told his parents that he used his body to barricade the entrance and shield them from the bullets.Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, a dual citizen of Canada and Israel, was killed in her home at Kibbutz-Holit, very close to the Israel-Gaza border. Her two children, said to be four months and four years old, survived. She had deep ties to Ottawa and the family released a statement confirming her death through the Jewish Federation of Ottawa, which did not provide details about how she died.Hayim Katsman, 32, who received his PhD from the University of Washington and specialised in Israeli studies, was also killed at Kibbutz-Holit. His mother, originally from Ohio, said on Facebook he was killed immediately in his home.Daniel Ben Senior, 34, was born in Los Angeles and a dual citizen with the US and Israel. She worked with a group of event organisers at the Nova festival. Her father Jacob told CNN he was notified by authorities that she had been killed.Vivian Silver, 74, was a well-known Israeli-Canadian peace advocate who was thought to be missing for weeks but was later identified as deceased. Her home close to the Gaza border in kibbutz Be'eri was burned to the ground during the 7 October attack. Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly described Ms Silver as a "lifelong advocate for peace".Igal and Amit Wachs, brothers who were citizens of both the US and Israel. They were part of a village patrol in Israel and Igal's ex-wife, Liat, who lives in Massachusetts, said she believed they had been called upon to fend off the attack. Shir Geory, 22, another Canadian identified to have been killed in the attacks. She went missing from the music festival. Tiferet Lapidot, 22, an Israeli woman with Canadian parents who is being counted among the Canadian dead. She disappeared from the Nova music festival and it had originally been believed she had been taken hostage.  Carmela Dan, 79,  an Israeli-American grandmother who was born in Israel to an American father. She held Israeli, US and French citizenship. She and four other family members had gone missing from the Nir Oz kibbutz in southern Israel. Her death, along with that of her 12-year-old granddaughter, was confirmed by Israel on 19 October.Judith and Natalie Raanan, a mother and daughter from the Chicago area, were released by Hamas on 20 October after they were taken from the Nahal Oh kibbutz in southern Israel on the day of the attacks. They hid in a bunker when the attack started and neighbours said they saw Hamas militants escort both Judith, 59, and Natalie, 19, out of the house.	
14/11/2023 12:54:00	Giving birth with no painkillers under the bombs in Gaza - BBC News	"My child doesn't have a name yet because of the war. She's four days old," says Kefaia Abu Asser. Sitting on a straw mat in a corner of a school shelter run by the UN in Rafah, in southern Gaza, Kefaia cradles her baby daughter, who is wrapped in a red blanket. Stress and exhaustion are visible on her face. Being a first-time mother is hard anywhere in the world, but Kefaia had to do it under unimaginable trauma.Originally from northern Gaza, the 24-year-old fled her home with her family after the Israeli military warned civilians to move to the south of the Strip for their safety. Kefaia was heavily pregnant. "I had to run and flee from one place to another. I was utterly exhausted. Initially we went to the Nuseirat Camp. But there was a bombing close to us. I saw bodies that had been ripped apart. It was extremely difficult," she tells a freelance journalist working in Gaza for the BBC.Kefaia and her family are among the hundreds of thousands who have fled northern Gaza and, like many others, she had to walk for miles, all the while worried about being bombed."It was so dangerous for my unborn child. I was scared all the time," she says. The family finally reached the Kuwaiti Hospital in Rafah city but its maternity ward had been closed down. Kefaia was then moved to the nearby Emirati Hospital."It was very hard because the number of women giving birth was huge," she says. "They were coming from all parts of Gaza, from the north to the south and everywhere in between.""There was a shortage of painkillers," she adds. "So they only administered it if the pain became really unbearable and only to those most in need." She gave birth with no painkillers. The World Health Organization (WHO) says more than half the hospitals in Gaza are not functioning due to lack of fuel, damage, attacks and insecurity. The UN estimates that around 50,000 pregnant women have been caught up in the conflict, and despite the state of hospitals, roughly 180 deliveries are expected to take place each day. Many pregnant women have been cut off from safe delivery services as hospitals are overwhelmed with casualties, out of fuel for generators, and lacking medicines and basic supplies - including for the management of obstetric emergencies. Ola Abu Oali was one of them. "My baby is two weeks old. He was born during the war, right here in this school," she tells Majdi Fathi, a freelance journalist working for the BBC in Gaza. Ola has another young son. They are all currently living in a different overcrowded UN school shelter in Rafah."Both my children are getting sick. Their stomachs are bloating and they have severe diarrhoea. Every time I breastfeed my baby, he vomits. I've had to take my other child to the hospital three times to put him on a drip, but his condition has not changed," she says.Access to clean water is one of the biggest challenges for the displaced in Gaza. The UN says each person has access to only three litres of water a day for all their needs. "We don't have any water. There is no milk for my baby. And the condition of the toilets is unbearable. There is a stench and we have to wait our turn to use it," Ola says. Wafaa Yousef Fakhry Ahmed is sheltering in the same school as Ola."I'm pregnant. I fear for my child's life. I'm approaching my due date and I'm worried about the environment I'm living in, about getting diseases. We don't have water for basic cleanliness, " she says. Wafaa is from Beit Hanoun, near Gaza's northern border, and has also moved from place to place in search of safety. "First, we went to a school in the Al-Muaskar area. We were asked to leave there too, so we came further south. We used carts and donkeys on some part of the way. But most of it, we walked, " she says. "We had no water with us to drink, so the only option we had was to drink from the sea. My husband was trying so hard to get one bottle for us to drink from." The WHO says maternal deaths are expected to increase in Gaza given the lack of access to adequate care. It says the hostilities have direct and deadly consequences for pregnancies, with a rise in stress-induced miscarriages, stillbirths and premature births. Asma is from Gaza City but is now living with her three young children in a tent in the compound of the Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah, central Gaza.She's pregnant and before she was forced to flee her home, she had gone to the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City for a check-up."Due to the constant sound of bombings, many women suffered miscarriages at Al-Shifa. The situation is unbearable, especially for pregnant mothers. I'm really worried about my baby and about having a miscarriage," Asma says. "Waking up with aching bones has become a daily reality. We're exposed to unsanitary conditions. And we've repeatedly witnessed distressing sights of dead bodies."Asma says she's exhausted and wants the fighting to stop. "I plead for a ceasefire. What is the fault of the children that they have to suffer this much? What is the fault of my baby who hasn't come to life yet?"Additional reporting by Majdi Fathi in Gaza and Haneen Abdeen in Jerusalem.	
14/11/2023 11:44:00	Israel confirms death of soldier held hostage in Gaza - BBC News	The Israeli military has confirmed the death of a soldier abducted by Hamas and held in Gaza following the group's massive attack on Israel on 7 October.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had informed 19-year-old Corporal Noa Marciano's family of her death.Cpl Marciano had appeared in a video released by Hamas on Monday. The IDF called it "psychological terrorism".She was one of about 240 hostages taken by Hamas gunmen during last month's attack, which killed 1,200 people.Cpl Marciano was serving as a lookout at the Nahal Oz kibbutz when it was stormed by part of a wave of gunmen who had burst through the nearby Israel-Gaza border, attacking dozens of Israeli communities, several military bases and hundreds of young people attending a music festival.As with all the hostages, Cpl Marciano's whereabouts in Gaza had not been known.Hamas's military wing claimed Cpl Marciano was killed in an Israeli air strike on 9 November, though this could not be independently verified.Following the 7 October attack, Israel launched a war against Hamas - proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western governments, including the UK. More than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Forty-six Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting inside Gaza over the same period, the IDF says.Since 7 October, Hamas has released four hostages and the IDF has rescued one. 	
14/11/2023 10:28:00	Blackpool family who fled Gaza fear for those left behind - BBC News	A British family who fled Gaza with only a small suitcase between six of them have said they do not know what the future now holds and they fear for the lives of those left behind. Emad Abuaassi and his wife Stephanie moved to Gaza from Blackpool a year ago, to be closer to his family. After the conflict began they left their flat in the middle of the night.They crossed the border into Egypt on 3 November and flew back to the UK but do not have anywhere permanent to live.Emad Abuassi said their family home in northern Gaza had been completely destroyed and he was worried for the safety of his mother, brothers and sisters in southern Gaza. "This is the saddest moment I have been across in my whole life," he said. "When I left the border I was looking behind me like just measuring who's going to be alive and who's going to have died after all this."Everybody's life there is in danger."Could be my mom passed away tomorrow, my brother, my cousin, my neighbour my friend."He and his wife and four children have been housed in emergency hotel accommodation in Cardiff and are waiting to hear about temporary housing. They are anxious for the children to resume schooling, after their education came to an abrupt end on 7 October.They also need medical aid, as Mrs Abuaassi has also been without the medication she needs for 15 days.  The couple's 14-year-old son said he was also worried about his relatives in Gaza who were all staying together in one house, but that he was happy to be back in the UK in emergency hotel accommodation."It's better than being in a flat with 50 people," he said."I mean it's nice having a bed to sleep on instead of sleeping on the mattress on the floor."He and his two brothers and younger sister are sharing two hotel rooms with their parents as they wait to find out if they can be housed. He said he missed studying and wanted to return to education."As soon as we get settled, we can start to get into school and that was kind of the most important thing right now to get into school," he said."So yeah, we need to get a house."Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

13/11/2023 22:02:00	Al-Shifa: WHO says Gaza hospital unable to bury dead bodies - BBC News	This story contains some upsetting detailsThousands could be trapped inside Gaza's largest hospital due to nearby fighting, while officials have warned of rotting bodies piling up there.Al-Shifa Hospital, which is also tackling power cuts and a lack of fuel, is "nearly a cemetery", the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.The hospital's manager said it was under a "blockade", and that dogs had started eating corpses. The area around the hospital has seen intense fighting in recent days.US President Joe Biden said he hoped to see "less intrusive action" at the hospital, which he said "must be protected". Gaza City has seen an intensification of fighting between Israeli and Hamas forces in recent days, much of which has been taking place in streets close to the hospital. There have been reports of tanks and armoured vehicles being within metres of the hospital gate. Israel accuses Hamas of operating a command-and-control centre in tunnels underneath the hospital, which Hamas and the hospital deny. It also accuses Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, of "preventing humanitarian solutions". Israel's army has also said that while there are clashes close to Al-Shifa, there is no shooting at the hospital itself nor a siege, and that anyone wanting to leave can do so. Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the WHO, said about 600 people remained in the hospital, with others sheltering in hallways. "Around the hospital there are dead bodies which cannot be taken care of or not even be buried or taken away to any sort of morgue," he said. "The hospital is not working at all any more as it should. It's nearly a cemetery."The Hamas-run health ministry has said there are at least 2,300 people still inside the hospital - up to 650 patients, 200 to 500 staff and around 1,500 people seeking shelter. Doctors have also spoken of bodies piling up and rotting at the hospital, and Dr Mohamed Abu Selmia, Al-Shifa's manager, said there were about 150 bodies decomposing, "leaving unpleasant odours". He told the BBC the Israeli authorities had still not granted permission for those bodies to leave the hospital to be buried, and that dogs had now entered the hospital grounds and started eating the bodies. There are also concerns about the fate of dozens of premature babies that are no longer able to stay in their incubators due to the power cuts. Dr Selmia said three babies were among several patients who have died due to a lack of oxygen. He said negotiations had been conducted with Israeli authorities to try to evacuate the babies, but that no agreement had been reached. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel was offering "practical solutions" to evacuate the babies, but accused Hamas of not accepting proposals. "They don't take the fuel that was offered for their generators. They don't support the movement of babies out in ambulances, so of course they're stuck there because [Hamas] want those terrible photographs," he said. He also accused Hamas of turning the hospital "into a war zone" by building tunnels underneath it. Hamas denies using the hospital for its operations, while doctors inside insist there is no Hamas presence there. As well as Al-Shifa, other hospitals across the Gaza Strip have reported widespread issues, including a lack of supplies and power due to the fighting and the blockade Israel has enforced on the territory since Hamas launched its attacks on Israel on 7 October. 	
13/11/2023 19:49:00	British-Palestinians ask PM for urgent meeting over Gaza - BBC News	A British-Palestinian group has written to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, asking for an "urgent meeting" about Gaza.The letter also urges the UK government to "use its influence" to call for a ceasefire. It was sent, earlier on Monday, by the UK-based International Centre of Justice for Palestinians.The ICJP said it was speaking "on behalf of members of the Palestinian community in the UK with families and loved ones living in Gaza".The group said it wanted a meeting "to express our concerns, similar to the meetings you have had with other British communities who have families in the region who have experienced distress similar to ours".Calls for humanitarian pauses were "inadequate", it said. And the government's failure to call for a ceasefire "is putting our loved ones in danger and is contributing to an unprecedented humanitarian crisis". "It also ignores our voices as British citizens with friends and family under attack in Gaza," the ICJP said. A spokesperson for the UK government told the BBC that it had "helped more than 150 British nationals and dependents to leave Gaza so far"."We must see humanitarian pauses that allow enough time for hostages to be released, as well as aid to go in," it said.It said the Foreign Office was in regular contact with those who remained in Gaza, "and our teams are working around the clock with the Israeli and Egyptian authorities to ensure they can leave as quickly as possible".Six British-Palestinians told a press conference dozens of their family members had been killed in Gaza.Lubaba Khalid, who stepped down from chairing the Young BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) Labour network last month, over comments made by Labour leader Keir Starmer, said she had found out on social media her relatives had been killed."Due to the lack of electricity and networks, we have found it very difficult keep in touch with family members just to check if they're alive," she said. "As a result, I found out my great uncle's house was bombed, on the social-media platform X [formerly known as Twitter] before I could get any confirmation from my own family."Six members of her family had been killed in that bombing, she said, five of them children.Accountant Omar Mofeed accused the UK government of "double standards" in its treatment of those evacuating Gaza. Non-British family members of British nationals who have fled Gaza and are now in Cairo currently need to apply for British family visas from Egypt. And Mr Mofeed pointed to the visa schemes available to those fleeing war in Ukraine, including the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme - also known as Homes for Ukraine - and the Ukraine Family Scheme, both of which are free for those applying. The Foreign Office has previously told BBC News it is working with the Home Office to process visas for non-British family members of British nationals who have left Gaza.	
13/11/2023 17:16:00	US airstrikes target more Iran-backed bases in Syria - BBC News	The US has conducted "precision" air strikes in Syria on facilities used by the Iranian revolutionary guard, the Pentagon has said. Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin said the strikes were in response to "continued attacks" on US bases in Iraq and Syria by Iran-backed fighters.At least eight pro-Iran fighters were killed, a UK-based war monitor said.It is the third time since 26 October that the US has carried out such air strikes.They come amid rising tensions in the region due to the Israel-Hamas war. Mr Austin confirmed the air strikes in a brief statement on Sunday, saying they were conducted against a training facility and a safe house near the cities of Albu Kamal and Mayadin in eastern Syria. He added the attacks were ordered by President Joe Biden "to make clear that the United States will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests".The Pentagon did not provide any details on the damage caused by the strikes, but the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, said eight members of Iran-backed militias were killed in the attack.Seven others were injured, SOHR said. Most of the victims were non-Syrian nationals.The group added that the strikes destroyed a weapons depot around Abu Kamal, near the Iraq-Syria border, and a rocket launch platform near Mayadin. Iran-backed militias had also fired rockets at US bases overnight, SOHR said, though no one was killed.The monitor has since reported a total of six attacks on International Coalition bases in Syria since Monday morning. Pentagon officials said last week that Iranian-backed militias have attacked US bases and facilities in Iraq and Syria at least 41 times since the Israel-Hamas war began on 7 October.They added that 56 US personnel have been injured in these attacks between 17 October and early November. The injuries are a combination of traumatic brain injury and minor injuries. All personnel have since been treated and have returned to work, the Pentagon said. American officials attribute the attacks to Iranian proxy groups operating in the region. Iran is believed to have deployed hundreds of troops in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad in the country's 12-year civil war. It has also armed, trained and financed thousands of Shia Muslim militiamen - mostly from Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, but also Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen - who have also fought alongside the Syrian army.On 27 October, the US carried out its first of the air strikes against two weapons and ammunition storage facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran-backed militias. Another "self-defence strike" was conducted on 8 November on a facility in eastern Syria by two F-15 aircraft, the Pentagon has said.With a war raging in the Gaza Strip and fears of an escalation into a regional conflict, there is an underlying worry that Iran and its proxies could soon get involved in the fight between Israel and Hamas, sparking a wider and even more serious war.The US has emphasised that its recent airstrikes are not connected to what is going on in Gaza, that they were not done in any coordination with Israel, and that they are completely separate actions of self-defence.American officials said they have been in contact with Iran and its proxies to warn against the escalation of fighting in the region. "We aim to clarify that our military actions do not signal a change in our approach to the Israel-Hamas conflict, and we have no intentions of escalating conflict in the region," a senior Pentagon official has said in a statement. Last month, President Biden sent a rare message directly to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warning him not to target US troops in the Middle East. 	
13/11/2023 17:03:00	UK doctor Ahmed Sabra finally gets to Egypt from Gaza - BBC News	A UK doctor who was stuck in war-torn Gaza when his name was left off a list of British nationals has finally reached Egypt.Ahmed Sabra, a UK citizen who holds a British passport, was visiting family in Gaza with his wife and three children at the start of the war.His wife and children were allowed to cross into Egypt on Thursday, but Dr Sabra was turned away.The Foreign Office said it was working to get all British nationals home.Dr Sabra, a consultant cardiologist at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire who was a cardiology registrar at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, said he had made it through the Rafah crossing on Monday and was waiting to get his passport stamped.Former colleague and friend Sara Gretton, who worked with him in Swansea, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that he had messaged her overnight to say his name was now on the list of British nationals eligible for evacuation and he was heading to the border.Thousands of foreign nationals have been making the same trip to the only open crossing out of Gaza, but only those named on a list, published daily by the Gaza Border Authority, are allowed to cross. Those on the list must be cleared by both Egyptian and Israeli authorities. Ms Gretton and Dr Sabra's supporters asked why he was not on the list last week. "It seems so simple you know - the Foreign Office informs the agencies that he is a British national, his name should be added to the list, it should be published and he should be evacuated.""I just don't know what has gone wrong since last Thursday, and that hasn't been done." Hamas's attacks on Israel on 7 October sparked the war. Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 240 others hostage in its unprecedented cross-border assault it launched that day.After a month of Israeli bombardment and nearly two weeks after Israel launched a major ground offensive into the territory, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said on Friday that 11,078 people had been killed, while 1.5 million had fled their homes.Dr Sabra's former colleagues at Morriston Hospital held a rally on Monday in support of his safe return home. The Foreign Office said it was working "round the clock to ensure all British nationals in Gaza who want to leave are able to".	
13/11/2023 16:31:00	Friend of 'IS Beatle' jailed for terrorism offences - BBC News	A British man who spent two years with Islamic State in Syria and knew the British militant dubbed Jihadi John, has been jailed for carrying a weapon for terrorist purposes. Aine Davis was also sentenced at the Old Bailey for fundraising after he tried to get his wife to send him 20,000 euros (£17,460). Intelligence services once believed that Davis was part of the "IS Beatles" who tortured and killed hostages.Davis was jailed for eight years. The sentence was made up of five-and-half-years for the firearms charge, and two-and-a-half-years for two fundraising charges - all of which are offences under the Terrorism Act. Davis was also given two years on licence after his sentence. He was deported to the UK in August 2022 after serving a prison sentence in Turkey for terrorism offences.Aine Davis was born in west London in 1984. By early adulthood he had a string of drug convictions, and he was jailed in 2004 for possessing a firearm. He became a Muslim and sometimes called himself Hamza, although he still has the name Aine tattooed on his left arm.In 2007 he spent time in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. In 2008 and 2009 he visited Yemen, and he travelled to Egypt in 2009 and 2011.He had become a committed Islamist extremist and attended the same West London mosque as Mohamed Emwazi, who went on to be the executioner in the so-called "Beatles" gang and became known as Jihadi John.At one point Davis was suspected by the intelligence agencies in the UK and the US of himself being a member of the "Beatles" kidnap and murder gang although that's no longer thought to be the case. Davis's barrister, Mark Summers KC, told the court the defendant's "early life was difficult and challenging", and religion had been his way out. He said his client felt it was his "religious obligation" to join the conflict in Syria after seeing images of the war in the country, and "he accepts that was terrorism". "The reality that he found when he arrived in Idlib was profoundly different from anything he would have ever imagined," said Mr Summers, adding his client had been naïve. He added Davis wished to apologise to the people of Syria, his own family, and the court.  Passing sentence, Judge Mark Lucraft KC said: "From the messages and images you sent to your wife it is clear you had been with fighters in Syria and that you were not there for lawful purposes."He added: "It is submitted on your behalf that there is much that has been said about you in the media and elsewhere that is not supported by evidence before the court."I make it clear I am sentencing you for the offences on the indictment and for nothing else."In February 2012 Davis left the UK with Alexanda Kotey, another friend from the mosque, and two other men who later died as foreign fighters in Syria. They travelled to Turkey where Kotey was denied entry, but Davis was not. For reasons that are not clear, Aine Davis was subsequently banned from Turkey in March 2012.In August 2012 Alexanda Kotey managed to get to Syria with Mohamed Emwazi. Kotey is currently serving a life sentence in the United States for the torture and murder of American hostages there.He admitted being a member of the kidnap gang that became known by their captives as the 'Beatles', a name they were given because of their British accents. Davis himself returned to Turkey in July 2013, and after crossing the border into Syria spent the next two years with the Islamic State group, but he has always denied being one of the 'Beatles' himself.In August 2014 Davis's wife Amal El-Wahabi, who he had met at a west London mosque, was found guilty of trying to send him the 20,000 euros (£17,460) for the purposes of terrorism.In November 2015 Davis crossed the border from Syria back into Turkey using a false passport. He planned to attend a meeting with other senior jihadists, possibly - according to Turkish court documents - to plot an attack in Turkey.He was arrested by Turkish police in a villa in a luxury coastal complex in Silivri rented by Kamran Faridi, an FBI asset.That same day Mohamed Emwazi (Jihadi John), was killed by a drone strike in Syria.Davis was jailed in Turkey for being a member of a terrorist organisation and after his release was deported to the UK and immediately arrested. On 10 October this year he pleaded guilty to possessing a weapon for terrorist purposes and two charges of fundraising. He had fought a lengthy legal battle to get the charges dismissed, arguing at the Old Bailey and the Court of Appeal he had already spent time in prison in Turkey for similar offences.In a statement following the sentencing, Cdr Dominic Murphy, who leads the Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command, said he hoped the case would send the message that "we will relentlessly pursue and seek to prosecute anyone involved in terrorism both in the UK and abroad, no matter how much time has passed".As recently as October 2020 US prosecutors in a press release had still been talking about four Islamic State Beatles, and although he was not named, Davis was the suspected fourth man.However, the American government never sought to extradite him, despite then Home Secretary Priti Patel in July 2022 having discussed with the US deputy attorney general whether Davis could be put on trial in the United States. Documents that emerged during his appeal suggest prosecutors in the Southern District of New York were still hoping to bring a case against Aine Davis as late as July 2022.Now Mohamed Emwazi is dead, and Alexanda Kotey and a third Briton El Shafee Elsheikh are serving life sentences in the US. But that only makes three "Beatles".Now it is less clear if there was a fourth Beatle. In public at least, exactly what Davis did in his two years with the Islamic State group remains something of a mystery. 	
13/11/2023 15:27:00	Israel-Gaza: Why this war is different to the others - BBC News	If this Gaza war was like all the others, a ceasefire would probably have been in force by now.  The dead would be buried and Israel would be arguing with the United Nations about how much cement could come into Gaza for rebuilding. But this war is not like that. It is not just because of the enormity of the killing, first by Hamas on 7 October, mostly of Israeli civilians, followed by Israel's "mighty vengeance" as its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it, which has mostly killed Palestinian civilians. This war is different to the others because it comes at a time when the fault lines that divide the Middle East are rumbling. For at least two decades, the most serious rift in the region's fractured geopolitical landscape has been between the friends and allies of Iran, and the friends and allies of the United States. The core of Iran's network, sometimes called the "axis of resistance", is made up of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis in Yemen and assorted Iraqi militias that are armed and trained by Iran. The Iranians have also supported Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza. Iran is also getting closer to Russia and China. Iran has become a significant part of Russia's war effort in Ukraine. China buys a great deal of Iranian oil. The longer the war in Gaza goes on, and as Israel kills more Palestinian civilians and destroys tens of thousands of homes, the greater the risk of conflict involving some members of those two camps. The border between Israel and Lebanon is heating up, slowly and steadily. Neither Israel nor Hezbollah want a full-scale war. But as they trade increasingly heavy punches, the risks of uncontrolled escalation will grow. The Houthis in Yemen have been launching missiles and drones towards Israel. They have all been brought down, so far, by Israel's air defences or by US Navy warships in the Red Sea. In Iraq, militias supported by Iran have attacked American bases. The US retaliated at some of their sites in Syria. Again, all sides are trying to limit escalation, but controlling the tempo of military action is always difficult. On America's side are Israel, the Gulf oil states, Jordan and Egypt. The US continues to give strong support to Israel, even though it is clear that President Joe Biden is uncomfortable about the way Israel is killing so many Palestinian civilians. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has said publicly that too many Palestinian civilians are being killed. America's Arab allies have all condemned what Israel is doing and called for a ceasefire. The sight of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fleeing their homes in northern Gaza and walking down the main road south raises the ghosts of Israel's victory over the Arabs in its independence war in 1948. More than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes at gunpoint by the Israelis, events referred to by Palestinians as al Nakba - the catastrophe. The descendants of the 1948 refugees include much of the population of the Gaza Strip. Dangerous talk by some of the extreme Jewish nationalists who are supporting the government of Benjamin Netanyahu about imposing another Nakba on Palestinians is alarming Arab states in America's camp, particularly Jordan and Egypt. One minister in Netanyahu's government even mused about dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza to deal with Hamas. He was reprimanded but not sacked. All that can be dismissed as the ravings of the lunatic fringe, but it is being taken seriously in Jordan and Egypt. Not nuclear weapons, of which Israel has a large and undeclared arsenal, but the prospect of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians being forced over their borders. As for the war itself in Gaza, senior western diplomats from countries that are firm allies of Israel's allies, told the BBC that ending the war, and dealing with the aftermath will be "difficult and messy". One said that "the only way through will be rebuilding a political horizon for Palestinians". That was a reference to an independent Palestine alongside Israel, the so called two-state solution, a failed idea that survives only as a slogan. Reviving it, perhaps in the context of a wider accommodation between Israel and the Arabs, is an ambitious plan, and perhaps the best idea around. But in the current atmosphere of pain, alarm and hatred it will be very difficult to deliver. It won't happen under the current leaderships of both Palestinians and Israelis. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not revealed his plan for the day after the fighting ends in Gaza, but he has rejected America's idea of installing a government led by the Palestinian Authority, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas and ejected by Hamas from Gaza in 2007. The second part of the American plan is for negotiations on a two-state solution, something that Benjamin Netanyahu has opposed throughout his political life. Not only is Mr Netanyahu against independence for the Palestinians. His survival as prime minister depends on support from Jewish extremists who believe the entire territory between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean was given to the Jewish people by God and should all be inside Israel's borders. Many Israelis want him out, blaming him for the security and intelligence failures that allowed the attacks of 7 October to happen. The Palestinian President Abbas is in his late 80s and is discredited in the eyes of potential voters, though he has not subjected himself to the ballot box since 2005. The Palestinian Authority cooperates with Israel on security in the West Bank but cannot protect its own people from armed Jewish settlers. Leaderships change, eventually. If this terrible war in Gaza doesn't force the Israelis, Palestinians and their powerful friends to try again to make peace, then the only future is more war. 	
13/11/2023 15:19:00	Israeli reservist: I chose to fight but don't know if I'll come back alive - BBC News	Yakir doesn't know when he'll be able to speak to his boyfriend again once his Israeli army unit goes into the Gaza Strip to fight Hamas."I haven't told my family I am going inside Gaza. I don't want them to be worried. Only my boyfriend knows I'll be inside.""I don't know what kind of mission I'm going to get, or if I will even come back alive."The 33-year-old was speaking to me hours before the mission was due to start, and he said he had permission from his superiors to speak to the BBC.In his interview, he said he felt Israel was given no option after the attacks of 7 October but to go into Gaza to destroy Hamas."If they didn't fear to enter Israel, we mustn't fear to go into Gaza, to make sure they will never do again what they did a month ago to innocent people, babies and children."Yakir was called up along with hundreds and thousands of reservists, immediately after the attack in which 1,200 people were killed and some 240 taken hostage.On the day of the attack, he and his boyfriend were asleep in their apartment when they were suddenly woken by red alerts on the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Home Front Command app, which warns of incoming rocket attacks."I live in Ramat Gan, next to Tel Aviv. We're used to alarms. I just went back to sleep," he recalls."But a little while later, my boyfriend shook me to tell me that terrorists had entered Kibbutz Be'eri and kidnapped 20 people… It was only a little part of what was happening."Yakir says he soon realised that he was going to be called up by the IDF."I understood how big it was. You knew it before the government said it. I got my bag ready, and said, 'Oh My God, I am now saying goodbye to my normal life.'"Yakir didn't want to be a soldier, he tells me. He didn't enjoy the army because he didn't like being ordered to do things. Military service is compulsory in Israel and like all conscripted men, he served three years until the age of 21. He remains eligible for reserve duty until he is 40.  Before 7 October, he wanted to go to the doctor to ask them to say that he was not fit to be a reservist on medical grounds. Immediately after the Hamas attack, Israel launched its offensive with the declared aim of destroying the group. The war has so far killed more than 11,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 4,500 children.I ask him what he thought of the civilian casualties. Yakir avoids answering my question directly, except to say that the IDF gives prior warning to evacuate civilians before striking. But in a war, he says, civilian deaths are unavoidable. "You have to remember, we didn't start this war." Instead of waiting to be called up, he put himself forward for active duty and tells me that he is fighting to live in a world in which Hamas - which Israel, the UK and other countries consider a terrorist organisation - no longer exists."But it was not easy, to leave what seemed like a perfect life for me, until that morning of 7 October."While he was waiting to be deployed, he wanted to make the most of his "normal life" with his boyfriend. They went to the familiar places that they enjoyed visiting before 7 October. "There's a lake in Ramat Gan national park. I went there with my boyfriend and some other friends. I just wanted to look at the dusk. I felt that it was the last time I was having a normal life before I was going to the army. I was sitting there, looking at the water, and quietly saying goodbye."Yakir was first deployed in the southern town of Sderot. He spent two weeks patrolling the city's streets. There were reports of Hamas gunmen still at large, and he saw some gunmen being captured. "I didn't sleep a lot. Fear was waking me up. I was missing my family. I was tired, hungry."We spoke as Yakir was preparing to enter Gaza, on foot and after nightfall. He didn't know how long his deployment would be."Inside Gaza, we won't have any cell phones. The enemy can track them and strike with missiles," he said. During a recent operation on the Gaza border, Yakir says, the whole unit had only one phone between them - a secure military phone - which he was sometimes able to use to send a short message to his boyfriend to say he was ok. His boyfriend then passed those messages on to his family.But this time he thinks it might not be so easy to stay in touch.Yakir just wants to believe that the war will be over quickly, or else that he will be replaced by another soldier, so that he can go back home.The lives of all Israelis have changed forever, Yakir tells me, and he is driven by a sense of unity that he tells me everyone in Israel feels at the moment. "Feeling unsafe is our national trauma now."Before the war, the country was deeply divided over the government's controversial judicial overhaul plans, which led to months of protests."What happened shocked the country so much that we decided we didn't want to fight with each other anymore," Yakir says. "The 7th of October reunited us. Orthodox and non-Orthodox, right wing and left wing, we're one nation today."As we end our call, Yakir tells me that he is very afraid."I know terrorists can pop up from tunnels, shoot at us and go back into the tunnels.""Already one officer of my unit has been killed. They can shoot rockets at us, and there are no alerts in Gaza."	
13/11/2023 12:39:00	Israel's president denies it is striking Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital - BBC News	Israeli President Isaac Herzog has denied that Israel is striking the largest hospital in the Gaza Strip.The UN has said the situation at Al-Shifa Hospital is dire, with constant gunfire and bombings in the area.Doctors there have said newborn babies have died after power for incubators was cut off due to a lack of fuel.When challenged by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg about those reports, Mr Herzog rejected them as "spin by Hamas" and insisted there was electricity.The president also showed what he said was a copy of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf was found on the body of a Hamas fighter in Gaza.He said a copy translated into Arabic was found "just a few days ago" in a children's room that had been "turned into a military operation base of Hamas".The Nazi leader's antisemitic manifesto was first printed in 1925.  Finding a copy of it in northern Gaza, Mr Herzog said, showed that some in Hamas "learned again and again Adolf Hitler's ideology of hating the Jews".On Sunday morning, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it had lost communication with its contacts at Al-Shifa, with staff and patients trapped by fighting outside. It warned that the hospital had been reportedly attacked multiple times over the previous two days, leaving several people dead and many others wounded. The intensive care unit had suffered damage, as had areas where displaced people were sheltering, it added.It also said there were reports that some people who fled the hospital were shot at.WHO chief Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus later said that contact has been restored but warned of "dire" conditions inside. He repeated calls for a ceasefire and said the hospital has been without electricity and water for three days.Doctors and the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza have said a lack of fuel for Al-Shifa's generators there means patients cannot be operated on and incubators for premature babies cannot run. But the president disputed this."We deny this at all, there is a lot of spin by Hamas... but there's electricity in Shifa, everything is operating," Mr Herzog told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. Israel has said that Hamas has a base underneath the hospital building - a claim denied by Hamas. Asked whether Israel has gone too far in its response to Hamas's 7 October attack, in which 1,200 people in Israel were killed and some 240 taken hostage back to Gaza, Mr Herzog said: "We work exactly according to the rules of international humanitarian law. We alert each and every civilian, because their homes have become terror bases".He added: "Unfortunately, there are tragedies. We don't shy away from them. But truly many of the tragedies are done by Hamas, like they bombed [Al-]Shifa hospital yesterday, not Israel."Surgeon Marwan Abu Saada told the BBC on Saturday that the hospital had run out of water, food and electricity.He said the sounds of shooting and bombardments echoed through the hospital "every second".Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israel would help evacuate babies from Al-Shifa following a request from the hospital administration. Dr Abu Saada said on Sunday night that three newborn babies had already died.The Israeli military also released a video of soldiers leaving 15 jerry cans of fuel on the side of a street for the hospital on Sunday but claimed Hamas stopped them being picked up. However, doctors said the amount would not bring enough power for an hour, while any evacuation of the babies needed specialised mobile incubators.Asked whether it was time to listen to calls from Israel's allies, including from France's President Macron, for a ceasefire and measures to reduce civilian casualties, Mr Herzog asserted Israel's right to defend itself after the October attacks. "We of course listen to our allies, but first and foremost, we defend ourselves," he said.He acknowledged that there had been civilian deaths in Gaza but blamed Hamas for many of the tragedies. Mr Herzog said his country's operations in Gaza were carried out "according to the rules of international humanitarian law", with Israel alerting civilians with phone calls and text messages, and urging them to evacuate from northern Gaza and "go down [to southern Gaza]"."We give them humanitarian pauses so that they can go down [south]," Mr Herzog said.He accused Hamas of stopping civilians from fleeing northern Gaza when asked about the pictures from Gaza showing many still sheltering in the area and reports that they were unable to leave.More than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. More than 1.5m people are also displaced, according to the United Nations' agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa).Fighting has been fierce in the northern part of the 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide enclave, but blasts have also hit the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis. 	
13/11/2023 10:40:00	Toddler among US hostages in Gaza - White House - BBC News	The White House says that a three-year-old American whose parents were killed by Hamas is among the hostages in Gaza.President Joe Biden raised the issue of hostages, including the toddler, with a call with Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad al-Thani of Qatar on Sunday. It comes as the White House says "urgent" efforts to free hostages taken after the 7 October attack by Hamas are continuing. The US says there are 10 Americans still unaccounted for since the attack.According to a readout of the call between Mr Biden and Sheikh Tamim released by the White House, the president "condemned unequivocally the holding of hostages by Hamas, including many young children, one of whom is a three-year old American citizen toddler".Both leaders said "all hostages must be released without further delay".Qatar was instrumental in efforts to release two US hostages who were abducted by Hamas's deadly raid on Israel last month and has been central to continuing efforts. Mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan, of Chicago, were released in late October, two of four hostages who have been freed. A fifth was rescued by Israeli forces. Israel Defense Forces have previously said the hostages include 20 children and between 10 and 20 people over the age of 60. On Sunday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS politics programme Face the Nation that active negotiations to release hostages were "under way between Israel and Qatar, who is communicating with Hamas, and the United States is involved in those discussions, very much involved in those discussions". "We are actively working to ensure the safe return of every American being held hostage and every other person being held hostage by Hamas," he said. President Biden's top Mideast adviser Brett McGurk is travelling to Israel and other countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, this week to work on the release of US hostages.Mr Sullivan told ABC News that nine US citizens and one permanent resident are currently missing. He is expected to meet the family members of the American hostages this week. CBS reported on Sunday that two US officials told the network that one of the main sticking points in the current negotiations is the fact that Hamas has yet to present a list of names of those it is holding or would be able to free. Other groups in the region, including Islamic Jihad, also have captives. Israel began striking Gaza after the Hamas attacks a month ago, which saw 1,200 people killed and more than 240 taken hostage.The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza since - of whom more than 4,500 were children. Mr Biden and Sheikh Tamim also discussed the need to protect civilians and the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the territory. 	
13/11/2023 07:11:00	Gaza: Surgeon ready to help says moral duty trumps fear - BBC News	With each passing day, groups of volunteer medics in different parts of the world remain on standby to go to Gaza to care for the thousands of injured and sick people who fill hospitals stretched to the extreme. Professor Nick Maynard is one of them.Nick is a consultant surgeon, based in Oxford, who's been travelling to the Gaza Strip and West Bank for more than a decade.Since 2010 he has been to Gaza almost every year, usually leading a group of medics who teach students and junior doctors. In May, he witnessed the conflict first-hand when at least 15 Palestinians, including three commanders of the militant group Islamic Jihad, were killed in Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip. Gaza locked down, and after four days of "non-stop" bombing Nick was evacuated by the UN.He is now on standby to go and work in operating theatres with the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, as soon as it becomes safe to do so amid the conflict between Israel and Hamas."A huge sense of duty" is motivating him to want to go and do what he can, and he says he is not alone."I think there is fear, apprehension, not knowing what one would find, but I think the other motives for doing so… are so powerful that they outweigh everything else," he says. "I consider it a huge privilege to be in a position to help these people who need help more than most of us can possibly understand."It just feels the right thing to do...I've got many friends over there who I'm very close to. I've got Gazan friends staying with us [now]." He shares the story of Enas, a young Gazan doctor he trained who he and his wife have become an "adoptive parent" to.She left Gaza eight years ago after securing a scholarship to study in England but has never been able to return.As part of Israel's blockade of Gaza, Palestinians are prohibited from entering and leaving except in extremely rare cases, including if people need care for life-threatening conditions or if they are on a limited list of merchants.When Enas got married, Nick walked her down the aisle because her family were denied permission to leave Gaza. She has had little contact with them in recent weeks due to communications blackouts, and goes days without knowing if they are alive or dead."They think they'll die," Nick says. "They've all written their names in indelible ink on their arms and their legs so that if they get killed, they'll be identified."The Islamic University of Gaza and Al-Azhar University, where Nick teaches, both sustained "serious damage" in October during bombing, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, which forms part of the Palestinian Authority.The Israel Defense Forces claimed the Islamic University of Gaza "serves as a central training centre for Hamas engineers" and a "training institution for the development and production of weapons", claims Nick is sceptical of."I've visited these buildings on many, many occasions and, more importantly, people I've known for many years and trust implicitly have spent decades in these buildings and [they] do not believe that happens," he says."It's inconceivable to me that they could be used as Hamas headquarters without the knowledge of people who work there day in, day out."Countries including Turkey, Jordan, and Egypt have been calling for a ceasefire, as well as the United Nations and the leaders of all of its major agencies.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said there would be no ceasefire without the release of Israeli hostages, but that humanitarian pauses might be possible to let aid into the enclave and hostages out. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also resisted calls for one, saying it would allow Hamas to "regroup and repeat" its 7 October attacks, in which it killed 1,200 Israelis and kidnapped more than 200 others.Nick insists that in order for Gazan patients to be helped there needs to be a complete ceasefire, "not a temporary pause of 48 hours", as well as the creation of multiple corridors of aid - including from Israel. "There's no way it can all come in through Rafah," he says, referring to the only crossing point for humanitarian aid on Gaza's southern border with Egypt."The main road up and down Gaza has been destroyed... so to transport patients from the north down to Rafah will, I think, be well nigh impossible. "And many of those patients - if there is still power in the hospitals, which is disappearing - may be on ventilators."More than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 4,500 children - but Nick believes those numbers could be just the tip of the iceberg."As a result of the bombings there will be large numbers of deaths due to untreated cancers, untreated diabetes," he says. "Until insulin was invented, diabetes killed everyone. Now, if they haven't got any insulin... diabetes will start killing people."If they've got no power, they can't give dialysis, so all patients in kidney failure will die, so that the amount of excess deaths will be huge in the next few months absolutely is a really important point."The World Health Organization has said a "public health catastrophe" was imminent in Gaza, due to mass displacement, overcrowding, and damage to water and sanitation infrastructure.These conditions are perfect for the rapid spread of infectious diseases like cholera, Nick adds."They're drinking dirty, non-sterile water at the moment. The big danger is that infectious diseases just take control and run through the population...and that will lead to many, many thousands of deaths."

12/11/2023 21:32:00	Five US troops killed in eastern Mediterranean air crash named - BBC News	Five American service members have died in a helicopter crash in the eastern Mediterranean, the US military says. It says the aircraft suffered a mishap while refuelling as part of a routine training exercise.The US has increased its operations in the region since the outbreak of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.President Joe Biden paid tribute to the victims, saying service members were putting "their lives on the line for our country every day". "We pray for the families of all our fallen warriors today and every day," he added. The military statement did not specify where the aircraft was flying from or where the crash happened.On Monday, the military named the victims as: But the US has moved two aircraft carriers, as well as ships and jets, to the eastern Mediterranean over the past month.The deployment reflects American concerns that the conflict between Israel and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region.In particular, the US is eager to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining the conflict.It is backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas.	
12/11/2023 01:50:00	Gaza hospital crippled as fighting rages nearby - BBC News	Staff inside Gaza's largest hospital have said patients and refugees are trapped in horrific conditions as heavy fighting rages in nearby streets.A surgeon at Al-Shifa in Gaza City told the BBC that the hospital had run out of water, food and electricity.  Israel said it had clashed with Hamas nearby but not fired on the hospital.It said it would help to evacuate babies to "a safer hospital" on Sunday, after medics said two had died and 37 others were at risk. The BBC has been sent pictures of at least 20 newborn babies being kept in a surgical theatre at Al-Shifa, as doctors warn they may die because the neonatal intensive care unit has stopped working, due to the lack of electricity.Reports from inside the hospital paint a picture of horror and confusion, with regular fighting nearby, patients who have recently undergone operations unable to evacuate, and bodies piling up without any way to bury them.Thousands of people are thought to have sought refuge in Al-Shifa, which has been at the centre of fierce fighting for two days. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) repeatedly accuse Hamas of operating from tunnels underneath the hospital, which Hamas denies.Surgeon Marwan Abu Saada told the BBC that the sounds of shooting and bombardments echoed through Al-Shifa "every second". He said attempts to bury the dead had been thwarted by fighting around the complex. "We don't want to have any outbreaks due to these dead bodies," he said, adding that the morgue refrigerator was not working because the generator had run out of fuel.Physicians for Human Rights Israel, a doctors group, said two premature babies had died because there was no electricity. The group warned that there was "a real risk to the lives of 37 other premature infants". Israel said there was no siege of Al-Shifa, and that the east side of the hospital was open for the safe passage of those who wanted to leave.Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israel would help those "in the paediatric department to get to a safer hospital" on Sunday.He said the decision was taken following a request from the hospital administration and Israel "will provide the assistance needed".Earlier, Colonel Moshe Tetro said there were clashes near Al-Shifa between Hamas and Israeli forces, but no shooting at the hospital itself. Pictures shared with the BBC show at least 20 infants in a surgical ward, wrapped in blankets and lined up in rows on adult hospital beds.Many of them appear to have tape on their faces, suggesting the need for oxygen administration.Doctors have warned for at least a fortnight that the number of available incubators was being reduced due to the power shortage amid the ongoing Israeli siege.Dr Abu Saada said the babies needed intensive care, life support equipment and artificial respiration."I'm afraid if we leave these children in this unit in this condition we are allowing them to die… they are premature babies", he said, in a voice note passed on to the BBC.International charities have warned that patients in hospitals close to fighting in Gaza are at risk of dying because of a lack of medical treatment. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) deputy medical coordinator told the BBC that if there was no ceasefire, "all the patients who are remaining in these hospitals will just die, and these hospitals will turn into graveyards".At the Al-Quds hospital, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said its teams were trapped inside alongside 500 patients and around 14,000 displaced people.Meanwhile one of Gaza's smaller hospitals, Al-Rantisi, was largely evacuated - with only a handful of patients and staff inside. The Gaza Strip is home to 2.2m people, but since the start of the war more than 1.5m people have been displaced, according to the UN's agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA).Hamas killed an estimated 1,200 people inside Israel on 7 October - many of them civilians - and took more than 200 others hostage. Israel's response inside Gaza has killed more than 11,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It says that figure includes more than 4,500 children.In an interview with the BBC on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron said Israel must stop killing Gaza's women and babies. Mr Macron called for a ceasefire and hoped other leaders - including the US and the UK - would join him.

11/11/2023 05:09:00	Macron condemns rising antisemitism and Israeli bombing of civilians - BBC News	Far from a distant observer, one of a chorus of countries offering opinions on the Israel-Gaza war, France feels very much caught up in the conflict. It is home to Europe's largest Jewish community and has the largest Muslim population of any European country. A recent YouGov poll suggested over 70% of French men and women fear Middle East tensions and violence could well spill over at home. There are fears about general security, as well as concerns about antisemitism and Islamophobia. The French authorities have reported a steep rise in antisemitic acts across the country.  On Friday, during our wide-ranging conversation at the Élysée Palace in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron spoke about the multiple challenges facing the world today, from climate change to combating global inequality, to the importance of continuing to support Ukraine against Russia. But when it came to the Middle East, the language the French president used was particularly emotive. On a number of occasions he listed the women, the babies, the old people in Gaza who, he said, had nothing to do with terror attacks, being killed in bombings by Israel. He insisted there was no justification for that and the bombing campaigns must stop. Palestinian lives matter, he said, humanitarian law must be respected.  In stark contrast to Washington, which has ruled out the idea of a ceasefire for now, Mr Macron repeated over and again during our conversation that to protect Gaza civilians a humanitarian ceasefire was needed. He urged Israel to accept one and said he hoped other world leaders, including in the US and the UK, would make the same case. At the same time as outlining why he believes there should be a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, Mr Macron also spoke with empathy for Israel following the Hamas massacre of about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and the hostage-taking of almost 240 others, including French citizens, just over a month ago."We work very hard to try to protect our people there," he told me. "We unhappily lost more than 40 French nationals and we still have hostages and when I speak about that first I think about our families."Hamas governs Gaza and is designated a terrorist organisation by many Western countries including the UK.Emmanuel Macron told me he was one of the first world leaders to call Israel's president and prime minister. "We share their pain and we share their willingness to get rid of terrorism. We know what terrorism means in France," he said.France has been the focus of a number of Islamist attacks in recent years. Since 2014, more than 260 people have been killed, according to France's Interior Ministry, and 1,200 people injured. Mr Macron said France "clearly condemned the terrorist attack and the (Hamas) terrorist group and recognised Israel's right to protect itself and to react". But from Day One, he emphasised, "France said Israel's reaction must respect the international rules of war and international humanitarian law".Did he believe Israel was flouting those laws in its military action in Gaza, I asked. The UN Secretary General says Gaza is turning into a graveyard for children.  With passions so inflamed across the Middle East as well as in France, Mr Macron said one month after Israel suffered such a devastating attack "I think it would not be the right way to deal with a partner and a friend, to say you will be condemned and you're guilty. I'm not a judge. I'm a head of state. I just remind everybody of international law. I call for the ceasefire."  A ceasefire would benefit Israel, said Mr Macron, because the images of its military strikes in Gaza, seen around the world, were fuelling resentment. "It's impossible to explain: we want to fight against terrorism while killing innocent people," he said. In reality, President Macron's words have far more impact back home than in the Middle East where, unlike the US, Iran or Egypt, for example, France is not viewed as hugely influential in the Israel-Hamas conflict. In Paris meanwhile, a demonstration planned for this Sunday against antisemitism has become highly politically charged - largely because Marine Le Pen's hard right National Rally party will participate.  Mr Macron has called for France to unite "without ambiguity" against antisemitism. He said there would be "no mercy shown in France for those inciting hatred", but also he has made headlines at home after his team announced he would not attend the demo in person.	
11/11/2023 01:16:00	Gaza casualties: 'Most of the children in my family photo are dead' - BBC News	Whole families have been wiped out in Israel's air strikes on the densely populated streets of Gaza, where many Palestinians live in multi-generational homes. Three Palestinians in the UK told the BBC that more than 20 of their relatives had been killed in one blow - and many were still stuck under the rubble.It was just another lazy, sunny Friday afternoon four years ago when Ahmed al-Naouq snapped this selfie with his family. But he remembers it well, especially now.Under the shade of olive trees by his father's house, his sisters and brothers got together with their children to eat, play and chat.Taking a break from running around, the children were ready to eat when Ahmed captured them together. Now, most of them are dead, he says.They were killed in an air strike which struck the family home on 22 October. In total, 21 people were killed including his father, three sisters, two brothers and 14 of their children.More than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli bombardment, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The air strikes began after the 7 October attack by Hamas, in which Israel says about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken hostage.Israel says its strategy in Gaza has been to root out Hamas which it accuses of operating in the heart of civilian communities - and that it takes steps to mitigate civilian casualties.In Ahmed's photo, only seven of the children who were killed appear. Some weren't there that day, some weren't even born.Like many Palestinians, Ahmed's brothers built their family homes above their father's - a tradition which means generations are being wiped out in one fell swoop. His sister Aya had gone there to take shelter with her children after her own apartment was damaged by an air strike. His other sisters, Walaa and Alaa, were there too with their children. The house was in the centre of Gaza in the town of Deir al-Balah, an area that had never been targeted before. They thought it was safe."I thought it's a scary time for them but they will be OK," Ahmed says, stunned now by his naivety.Ahmed moved to London four years ago to work for an NGO and hasn't been home since. The last time he saw the children together was by video call. He had been given a bonus and, as part of a family tradition, he promised his nieces and nephews a treat. "They all said that they want to go to the beach and rent a chalet and have food and dance together and enjoy," he says. So, he hired one and bought them dinner and snacks.The children called him from the beach that day, fighting over the phone to talk. So many of them are dead now that Ahmed stumbles as he remembers the names and ages of each one.  His 13-year-old nephew Eslam was the eldest and the one he knew best. Ahmed was a teenager and living at home when Eslam was born. His mum looked after the baby while his sister was at work, so Ahmed often helped to feed and change him.As Eslam grew older, he said wanted to be like his uncle. He was the top of his class, Ahmed says and working hard at English so that he could also come to the UK. Eslam was killed alongside his little sisters - Dima who was 10, Tala who was nine, Nour who was five and Nasma who was two, as well as his cousins Raghad (aged 13), Bakr (aged 11), girls Eslam and Sarah who were both nine, Mohamed and Basema who were eight and Abdullah and Tamim who were six. After the attack, Ahmed posted pictures of each of the children online to let the world know what had happened to them. Among them was three-year-old Omar. The little boy had been in bed with his mum Shimaa and dad Muhammed - Ahmed's brother - when the bomb fell.Then Ahmed got a call from one of his surviving sisters: Omar was alive. Ahmed's brother Muhammed had been killed but Shimaa and her little boy miraculously survived. "That was the happiest moment in my life, ever," Ahmed says.The only other person pulled from the rubble alive was 11-year-old Malak. She was badly injured, with burns over half of her body. When I met Ahmed, he showed me a picture of Malak in her hospital bed - her body was entirely covered in bandages. At first, I mistook her for a boy because her hair was short. It must have burned in the fire, Ahmed said.Malak's father wasn't in the house when it was hit and he is alive. But his wife and two other children were killed. When Ahmed messaged him to ask how he was doing, he replied: "A body, no soul."A week after the bomb, communications from Gaza were almost entirely cut off as Israel escalated its attack, and Ahmed couldn't contact anyone. When the signal was reconnected two days later, he learned that Malak had died.Medical supplies were dwindling to nothing and the 11-year-old had to be taken off the ICU unit when a more urgent case came in. She was in a lot of pain. "I died a hundred times every day," her father told Ahmed, as he watched the eldest and last of his three children fade away.Just before the communication blackout, Ahmed also found out that his uncle's house had been hit. He's still not sure who was killed there. On Tuesday, he also learned that the home of his close friends Maisara and Laura had been hit. Again several generations were killed - Laura survived but Maisara is still missing underneath the rubble. In all, we spoke to three people in the UK who had each lost more than 20 family members in Gaza. Darwish al-Manaama told the BBC that 44 of his family died. Among them was his niece Salma and her husband, their four adult children and their grandchild who was barely one. Darwish found out his family had died from a list sent to him on WhatsApp. After sharing some details, he was too overwhelmed to talk. Yara Sharif, an architect and academic in London, sent me photos of her aunt's family home which was destroyed in an Israeli strike a week into the war. "It was a very beautiful house," Yara says, "A beautiful mansion with a big courtyard in the middle." Like Ahmed's family, the sons built apartments for their own families on top of their parents.Yara found out that 20 of her relatives had been killed on Facebook - her aunt and uncle, her two cousins and their 10 children, as well as six members of the extended family.Some of their bodies were pulled from the rubble and they appear as numbers on the list of dead released by the Ministry of Health. Yara sent us a screenshot of the list with a rough red mark by each name and, on the right-hand side, their ages. Sama was 16, Omar and Fahmy were 14-year-old twins, Abdulrahman was 13, Fatima 10, Obaida seven, cousins Aleman and Fatima were both five, Youssef was four and Sarah and Anas were three.Yara has two cousins left. They asked not to be named, worried by an unsubstantiated rumour that those who speak to the media are being targeted.The sisters are in different parts of Gaza and can't reach each other to hold a funeral or grieve. And anyway, as Yara's cousin messaged her: "Muhammed's body and Mama's and the two children are still under the rubble." There is not enough fuel to run excavator machines in Gaza and any that are working are needed to rescue those who are alive.On Friday, as I sat with Ahmed al-Naouq watching the news, the list of the dead scrolled down the screen. I asked him if his family were on it. "Only 12 of them," he said. The other nine hadn't yet been recovered.After the bombing, his oldest sister, who was at her own home when it happened, went to visit the ruins. But she told Ahmed she couldn't stay long because she couldn't stand the smell of rotting flesh. Ahmed struggles to keep in touch with his surviving sisters. Often phones aren't working, and he loses touch with them.He struggles to find the words in English to describe what he has been feeling since the bombing, saying it feels as if his heart is no longer in his chest. Crying is pointless, he says, because it changes nothing. "I feel like I can't stand still. I can't sit still. I can't sleep at night," he says. "There's nothing you can do to stop this feeling."Ahmed says his father was the kindest man he had ever known. He worked hard driving a taxi and in construction to build a home for his children and educate them well. He listened obsessively to the news and believed the only solution to this conflict was a one-state solution, where Jews and Palestinians would live alongside each other in peace.But thinking of his only surviving nephew, Ahmed wonders: after this war has taken so many people he loves, what will Omar believe?

11/11/2023 00:33:00	Israeli forces surround north Gaza hospitals - BBC News	Shelling, gunshots and explosions took place outside Gaza City hospitals on Friday as Israeli forces continued their ground operation against Hamas. Social media videos showed panicked and injured people running for cover.Israel has always maintained that Hamas fighters hide in tunnels under hospitals, making the structures legitimate targets.The Red Cross warned that hospitals in Gaza had "reached a point of no return".It added that its staff attempting to deliver medical supplies had witnessed "horrendous" scenes, and described the destruction as "unbearable".In Gaza as a whole, the Hamas-run health ministry says 11,078 people have been killed since the start of the war and more than 27,000 others have been injured.Israel's bombardment of Gaza and ground operations followed Hamas's unprecedented mass attack on southern Israel on 7 October.On Friday evening, Israel revised down the number of people killed during the attack to about 1,200, from the earlier figure of 1,400.Foreign Ministry spokesman Lior Haiat said the revised number was because many bodies were not immediately identified after the attack, and "now we think those belong to terrorists... not Israeli casualties".Reports that Israeli forces in Gaza were surrounding several hospitals in Gaza City began to emerge early on Friday morning.One person inside the Al-Quds hospital told the BBC that they could hear "continuous clashes and explosions", while eyewitnesses near the Al-Rantisi Paediatric Hospital said that Israeli troops were using megaphones to order anyone who was not medical staff or patients to leave the premises.In one video posted on social media and verified by the BBC, a large group of civilians - many of them carrying white flags - can be seen trying to leave the courtyard of another hospital, Al-Nasr, when gunshots ring out, sending panicked people running for cover. Videos posted on social media appeared to show the aftermath of a missile or mortar striking the courtyard at Al-Shifa, the city's largest hospital, while others appeared to show dead children and scenes of panic outside the outpatients' clinic.Dr Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, said that up to five Israeli strikes had damaged parts of Al-Shifa hospital, including the maternity ward. "If Al-Shifa hospital goes out of service it will be a disaster for the people of Gaza City," Dr Al-Qudra said, adding that staff were afraid.The Hamas government reported 13 deaths at Al-Shifa, while Dr Al-Qudra said he knew of one fatality but could not confirm any others.By Friday evening, tensions in Gaza City remained high.People inside Al-Shifa said they could still hear explosions and firing around the hospital and that Israeli tanks were about 100m (328ft) away. The director of the hospital told the BBC that around 15,000 people remained in the structure - largely the elderly and the sick who cannot make the journey further south to where Israel has promised greater safety. He added that staff were overwhelmed by the number of injured people and were having to treat people in corridors and on the floor.The fighting around Al-Quds hospital also intensified as night fell. The BBC understands an Israeli navy ship was involved as well as tanks, which have surrounded the hospital.Speaking at the UN Security Council on Friday, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the situation on the ground in Gaza was "impossible to describe".Dr Tedros said that hospital corridors were "crammed with the injured, the sick, the dying", that morgues were "overflowing", and that surgeries was being performed without anaesthesia.He added that half of the Gaza Strip's 36 hospitals were not functioning at all, and that the remaining ones were operating "way beyond their capacities". He said that civilians in Gaza "are not responsible for this violence, but are suffering in ways that we in this room cannot imagine."A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the IDF "does not fire on hospitals" but that "we'll do what we need to" if Hamas fired from hospital grounds.When asked what the plan was to deal with patients in the hospitals who could not walk, or those who were on drips and with broken bones, he said: "Our plan is - and we're taking an operational risk here - we're saying to Hamas to move people south."Hamas has previously denied claims that it places command posts under Gaza hospitals to use them as shields. The US says Israel has agreed to daily four-hour military pauses in northern Gaza for humanitarian purposes - yet the fighting remained intense on Friday.	
10/11/2023 18:28:00	News outlets deny Israeli claim that freelance journalists knew of Hamas attack - BBC News	A number of news outlets have strongly rejected Israeli accusations that four freelance photographers they worked with in Gaza had prior knowledge of the Hamas attacks on 7 October.Israeli minister Shlomo Karhi said "certain individuals" who had worked for Reuters, AP, CNN and the New York Times "had prior knowledge".All four outlets have denied the claims, which have since been debunked.The NYT said the "outrageous" accusations endangered freelancers.Hamas launched devastating and unprecedented attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers, and kidnapping more than 240.Mr Karhi's comments followed a report on the pro-Israel website Honest Reporting, which suggested - without supporting evidence - that the photographers' presence may have been "part of the plan".It said that the presence of the photographers on October 7 in the early hours of the attacks "raised ethical questions".However, Gil Hoffman, Honest Reporting's executive director, has since confirmed the lack of evidence. AP quoted him on Friday as saying he was satisfied by explanations given by some of the journalists that they had no prior knowledge.But he maintained that the site's questions were "legitimate", adding that "we don't claim to be a news organisation".Images filed by the photographers included a burning Israeli tank, Palestinians breaching a fence at the Kfar Aza kibbutz and scenes from the attack itself.In a statement made on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Israeli government's press office said the website's "disturbing findings" showed the photographers had crossed "every professional and moral red line".Reuters, AP, CNN and the New York Times all issued statements saying there had been no arrangements in advance with any of the journalists to provide photos.The New York Times described the accusations as "reckless"."The Times has extensively covered the Oct. 7 attacks and the war with fairness, impartiality, and an abiding understanding of the complexities of the conflict," it said.It also defended the work of freelance photojournalists in conflict areas, adding their jobs "often require them to rush into danger to provide first-hand witness accounts and to document important news. "This is the essential role of a free press in wartime."It said one of the photographers, Yousef Massoud, had not been working with the paper on that day but had "since done important work for us".Associated Press said: "No AP staff were at the border at the time of the attacks, nor did any AP staffer cross the border at any time.""When we accept freelance photos, we take great steps to verify the authenticity of the images and that they show what is purported," it added.The agency said it was no longer working with one of the journalists, Hassan Eslaiah, who was found to have been pictured with Hamas Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar. CNN said it had no prior knowledge of the attacks, but said it also would suspend its ties with Eslaiah.Reuters also denied that it had prior knowledge of the attack or had "embedded journalists with Hamas" on 7 October.On Thursday, Honest Reporting said they "did not accuse Reuters of collusion" but was rather raising "serious ethical issues regarding news outlets' association with these freelancers".After the website's initial report, Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, said the photojournalists should be treated as terrorists if it was proven they knew in advance of the 7 October attacks.An MP for the ruling Likud party, Danny Danon, also said the journalists would be added to a list of people marked for assassination because of their participation in the attacks.Journalists are protected under international law which says they must be treated as civilians and protected as such during conflicts.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) says at least 39 journalists and media workers have been killed since the current war began, including 34 Palestinians, four Israelis and one Lebanese."Journalists in Gaza face particularly high risks as they try to cover the conflict in the face of an Israeli ground assault on Gaza City, devastating Israeli airstrikes, disrupted communications, and extensive power outages," it said.	
10/11/2023 17:11:00	Israel-Gaza: Union members block arms factory in protest over conflict - BBC News	Hundreds of trade union members blockaded a factory which manufactures weapons in protest over the Israel-Gaza conflict.Demonstrators blocked entrances to the BAE Systems site in Rochester, Kent, at about 07:00 GMT on Friday.They claim the factory provides components for military aircraft being used to bomb Gaza.A spokesperson for BAE said: "We respect everyone's right to protest peacefully."The blockade was organised as part of an International Day of Action for Palestine.Members are calling for "an end to the UK government's complicity in war crimes being committed in Palestine", which includes an end to arms sales to Israel and support for an immediate ceasefire.The Ministry of Defence declined to comment.In a statement, activists said the UK industry - which includes the site being blockaded - "provides 15% of the components in the F35 stealth combat aircraft that are currently being used in the bombardment of Gaza".One organiser said more than 400 trade unionists were involved in the action at the site. They said the group included health workers, teachers, hospitality workers, academics, artists and more who are members of eight trade unions.Alexandra, a teacher and member of the Nation Education Union, explained why she joined the blockade."As a teacher, seeing 185 schools and other educational institutions in Gaza bombed is utterly heart breaking."She added: "We're here today to disrupt the Israeli war machine and take a stand against our government's complicity and we urge workers across the UK to take similar action in their workplaces and communities."Harriet, an A&E doctor, said the blockade aimed to turn workers away and prevent deliveries getting in and out of the factory.She said: "I'm here because I'm a person. I'm also here because I'm a medic and we've seen hundreds of medical staff in Gaza killed, some still under the rubble.Jeanine Hourani, from the Palestinian Youth Movement and the University College Union, said the demonstration is part of a "global, transnational movement" that aims to end the arms trade to Israel.She said: "We're here as British workers to say unequivocally that we do not accept the use of British labour in the war crimes that are currently being perpetrated in Palestine."A BAE Systems' spokesperson said they were "horrified" by the situation in Israel and Gaza and the "devastating impact it's having on civilians"."We respect everyone's right to protest peacefully. We operate under the tightest regulation and comply fully with all applicable defence export controls, which are subject to ongoing assessment."Kent Police said the demonstration remained peaceful with no arrests, and dispersed at 14:10 GMT.Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

10/11/2023 15:18:00	'Her life is painkillers' - The Gaza children ravaged by war - BBC News	Nehad Abu Jazar sings softly as she tries to comfort her two-year-old girl Fatima. But it is hard to imagine what will soothe her child when the reality of what has happened is so devastating."On 17 October we were awakened by the sound of bombing and found ourselves trapped under rubble. Fatima had been in my lap but she managed to get out of it. When I got up to help her, I saw that both her legs had been crushed," she says in an interview filmed for the BBC by freelance journalists in Gaza.Fatima's legs had to be amputated from below the knees. Sitting in her mother's lap in the European Hospital in southern Gaza, Fatima's face is streaked with tears, her legs are wrapped in white bandages, and she cries as if she's in pain.Nehad and her husband had tried for 14 years to have a baby. And then Fatima was born."I'm truly grateful that she survived. But what is her fault? What has she done wrong? I want her to have a normal life like other children," Nehad says. "Right now we are constantly giving her painkillers. When the effect of one wears off, we give her another. Her life revolves around painkillers. And every other day she undergoes surgery."A month of intense bombardment on Gaza - Israel's retaliation for a devastating attack by Hamas that killed about 1,200 people - has taken a terrible toll on its residents. At least 10,800 people have been killed, including more than 4,400 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israel disputes the accuracy of the numbers, but the World Health Organization believes the figures are trustworthy.More than 26,000 people have been hurt, many of them, like Fatima, left with life-changing injuries.In a room next door lies 13-year-old Amira Al-Badawi. She has striking light brown eyes and dark hair."I was sleeping when we were bombed. I woke up not able to breathe. I could hear people's sounds. There were rocks above and under me," she says.Amira has suffered severe injuries to her spine and it's not clear if she will be able to walk again. The strike killed her mother and seven of her brothers.Her father, Iyad al-Badawi, says they had fled their home in Al-Zaytoun after warnings from the Israeli military, and moved to Rafah in southern Gaza. That's where, he says, they were bombed. Israel has been telling Gazans to move south for their own safety, but it has also continued to bomb central and southern areas of Gaza. It says it will hit Hamas targets wherever they are."I was taken to hospital, and there one after another I heard about my children and wife being killed. We raised them, educated them, some were married. And now we've ended up losing them," Iyad says. He says he is thankful that his 18-month-old son and three of his daughters had survived."I ask for peace and security," Amira says. "I want to be treated for my injuries and go back to my normal life, to my home. I want to feel safe again."But there's no home to go back to. And nowhere in Gaza is safe. The hospitals fill up with the dead and wounded, a large number of whom are children. Assef Abu Mazen lived by the beach in Al-Nuseirat. The 11-year-old played football at the neighbourhood club. He started off as a defender but then was made his team's goalkeeper. Assef says he was playing football with his friends when an air strike destroyed his home and permanently changed his life. His right leg had to be amputated below the knee. It's still heavily bandaged."I'm only 11 years old. I haven't harmed anyone. What's my fault?" Assef says. He had wanted to become a professional footballer but that dream is over."I was quite good at it, if you want to check you can ask my coach," he says. One Friday morning an opponent hit the ball fiercely at an angle, he recalls: "I made a leap and managed to deflect it back."The family shares a photograph of Assef in his football kit - a light blue jersey, dark blue shorts, green and black shoes. "My kit is buried under the rubble of our home. My socks are gone, my shoes, and the football I owned. They've all turned to dust," Assef says.He is taken around the hospital complex in a wheelchair by volunteers. The complex is full of makeshift tents, temporary shelters for people fleeing fighting in the north.  Assef jokes with the volunteers. Laughter might seem out of place, but it's one way of coping with the fear and grief many Gazans are going through.His mother says that behind the brave face he's putting on is a little boy scared for his future. "He asks me if his classmates will call him the boy with a severed leg and if they'll make fun of him," she says. "At night, I often find him crying while looking at old pictures of him running or playing football." Additional reporting by Majdi Fathi and Haneen Abdeen	
10/11/2023 13:51:00	Where will Scotland's pro-Palestinian demos be held on Armistice Day? - BBC News	Thousands in Scotland are expected to join pro-Palestinian marches across the UK on Armistice Day on Saturday. They are calling for a ceasefire in the war in Gaza, on the same day people gather to remember those who have died in military conflicts since World War One.The UK government has branded the planned November 11 marches as "provocative and disrespectful".Protests began in London on 14 October, one week after Hamas launched an attack in Israel that killed 1,400 people and saw 229 held as hostages.Since then, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 10,800 Palestinians have been killed.Where and when are the marches in Scotland?In Scotland there have been protest marches over the last four weekends.Pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central railway stations last Saturday.And on Thursday, five people were arrested after a group occupied the roof of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.First Minister Humza Yousaf, whose parents-in-law escaped from Gaza last week, has backed the right of protesters to hold events on Armistice Day.The first minister also said he was "beyond angry" at the UK government wanting to "drive every issue into a culture war".Marches are being organised by the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, an affiliate of the Scotland-wide Gaza Genocide Emergency Committee.The campaigners rejected any suggestion that they would disrupt Armistice services. They told BBC Scotland they would be reading out World War One poetry and wearing black.Protests are scheduled for Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee and Forres in Moray.In Edinburgh, a short Armistice Day service is expected to start at 10:52 on Saturday in Princes Street Gardens. There will be two-minute silence at 11:00. A pro-Palestinian protest is scheduled on nearby Waverley Bridge at 12:00City of Edinburgh Council urged anyone organising a protest to get in contact and said it had waived the requirement of 28 days' notice for marches.Council Leader Cammy Day said: "The council supports the fundamental right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, as outlined in the European Convention on Human Rights."I'd urge any organisers to contact the council as soon as possible so we can work together to plan your demonstration in a in a safe, organised and efficient manner."Speaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Dr Claire Armstrong, CEO of Legion Scotland, behind the Edinburgh remembrance event, said it would "proceed as normal" and security measures were in place.She said: "I think rather than concerns, it has created more of a positive reaction. We may see more people coming to events."Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie said: "Public safety is our priority and an appropriate policing plan is in place this weekend."We continue to engage with those organising demonstrations to ensure rights to peaceful assembly and protest are protected while minimising disruption to communities."Hate crime, violence or abuse do not represent legitimate protest and we will respond professionally to offending."	
10/11/2023 13:35:00	Egypt holiday couple died after room sprayed for bedbugs, inquest rules - BBC News	A British couple died in Egypt from carbon monoxide poisoning after the next-door hotel room was sprayed with pesticide to kill bedbugs, an inquest has ruled.John Cooper and Susan Cooper, from Lancashire, fell ill while on a family holiday in Hurghada on 21 August 2018.An inquest heard the next-door room had been fumigated following a report of a bedbug infestation. James Adeley, senior coroner said the couple were poisoned overnight.Mr Cooper, 69, and his wife, 63, had been enjoying a "brilliant" holiday while staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel, Preston Coroner's Court heard.But around lunch time on the eighth day into their holiday the room next to theirs, which had an adjoining locked door between them, was fumigated with pesticide, known as Lambda, for a bedbug infestation. The room was then sealed with masking tape around the door.Hours later the couple returned to their room for the night but were found seriously ill the next day by their daughter, Kelly Ormerod.Mr Cooper, a builder, was declared dead in the room and Mrs Cooper, a cashier in a Thomas Cook bureau de change, hours later in hospital.The inquest heard in some countries the pesticide Lambda is sometimes diluted with another substance, dichloromethane, which causes the body to metabolise or ingest carbon monoxide.Following a three-day inquest hearing, Dr James Adeley, senior coroner for Lancashire, ruled the deaths, on 21 August 2018, were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning as a result of inhaling the vapour from spraying the pesticide which contained dichloromethane. At the time of their deaths, Thomas Cook removed all of its customers from the hotel.The inquest, five years on, also heard of multiple, repeated attempts to obtain more documents and information from the authorities in Egypt despite numerous requests from the Foreign Office.Dr Adeley said Mr Cooper's illness and death was rapid, but described the medical treatment provided for Mrs Cooper as "utterly insufficient" after she was taken to a clinic in the hotel before an ambulance was called, creating a delay of four hours before she got to hospital.Ms Ormerod said "after more than five years of waiting, we've finally been given some closure around the deaths of mum and dad". "Our family still struggle to comprehend what we went through that day and feel like it should never have happened," she said."The last few years have been the most traumatic time for all of us. "Having to relive everything at the inquest has been harrowing but it was something we had to do for mum and dad. "We'd do anything to have them back in our lives but we take some small comfort from at least having the answers we deserve."Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

10/11/2023 03:06:00	Divided communities in the occupied West Bank - BBC News	On a hillside overlooking Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, three young Palestinian men are engaged in a scene that could be from biblical times. Working with practised speed, they strip olives from a laden tree. The ripe fruit falls to the ground in glistening piles.But, this is new work for Ahmed. Before 7 October he worked on Israeli construction sites, making around 400 shekels (£85; $105) a day. After the attacks of 7 October, almost all Arab access to Israel from the West Bank was banned. Ahmed, like many others, lost his livelihood."There's no [decent] work now," he tells me as he strips the branches clean. "I work one day here, one day there - in the fields, picking olives. I need to feed my family. What can I do?"Israel's intense security crackdown in the West Bank has not only affected Ahmed economically. Checkpoints, already a source of huge resentment, have imposed even greater restrictions on his freedom of movement. "They have closed roads. I can only walk around my home now. These checkpoints are suffocating us."The same increased security that Ahmed criticises has made people like Danny Chesterman feel safer. A cheerful man who used to run bike tours, he lives in the settlement of Efrat. He moved to Israel decades ago, but has retained his London accent."We're being portrayed as illegal settlers stealing Arab lands," he replies, when I ask him about the way his community is seen from the outside. "In general, we have not stolen anyone's land.""We are people that go to work in the morning. We run businesses. We have professors at university. We are people of the book and not of the sword."There was international controversy at the start of the year, when the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu legalised nine settlements in the West Bank.The UN and many countries say all settlements are illegal under international law. It is something many Israelis, especially those living in the settlements, vehemently dispute.One thing few people would disagree on is that the events of 7 October, as well as Israel's military response, have soured relations between Jewish settlers and their Arab neighbours. "I hope and I believe that the relations with our immediate neighbours here in the Arab villages will continue to be good," Danny tells me. "Having said that, obviously there are security concerns." On the morning of 7 October, Hamas - proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many others - launched an unprecedented assault on Israel. Around 1,400 people died and around 240 others were taken hostage.In response Israel launched air strikes on Gaza, and its troops have since entered the enclave. Israel says it will not rest until Hamas is destroyed. So far, the military campaign is thought to have left more than 10,800 people dead, including 4,400 children. Danny tells me he has heard the Hamas attackers had help from Gazans who worked with Israelis. He says it has fundamentally altered the way people here seem to think about their Arab neighbours."There were instances near the Gaza Strip of kibbutzim (rural communities) where they had a fantastic relationship with Arabs working there and later discovered maps describing the village with the names of the families," he claims."Really terrible things that they discovered from people who they believe they had excellent relationships with."It is a sentiment echoed by Oded Rivivi. He has been mayor of Efrat for more than a decade, and insists that while relations between his settlement and most of the nearby Arab villages had always been good, they have fundamentally changed, for now at least."How long will it take to overcome it? Only time will tell. But as long as you don't hear Arab leaders going out and condemning (Hamas)... it's definitely making it take longer for that trust to be rebuilt," he says.In Arab villages back across the valley, there are very different catalysts for mistrust - Israel's security crackdown has not only involved extra checkpoints. In the last month, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have arrested more than 1,400 Palestinians. They claim most were connected to Hamas. Just on the day we are filming, the Palestinian Authority says 18 people were killed in the West Bank, taking the total to 170 in just over a month. It has been met with Palestinian protest, both violent and peaceful. In Bethlehem, for example, shopkeepers held a general strike. While much of the anger has come as a consequence of what is happening in Gaza, the West Bank was already a tinderbox before 7 October. Settler violence has been a particular source of rage. Young Israeli men, often well-armed, are accused of forcing Palestinian families from their homes. One video showed a Palestinian man being shot in the leg by a settler armed with an assault rifle. Back in Efrat, I challenge Mayor Oded over those concerns. "There is a small group of extremists that do act violently," he tells me, "and those people need to be dealt with by the police… [but] the vast majority of people, Jewish people who live here, deserve security, deserve to be treated like human beings… because that's the nature of these communities".He insists action will be taken."Last night we had a meeting with the prime minister, all of the mayors. There was a consensus calling for the government to make sure that these extremists get arrested, get stopped, and the quicker it happens, the less damage it will do."In the end, all these conflicts come down to land. Two groups of people both firmly believe in their right to possibly the most contested piece of land on earth. For decades, the international call has been for a "Two-State Solution", with the West Bank and Gaza making up an independent Palestinian nation, with East Jerusalem as its capital.Over recent years it has seemed an ever less likely prospect. The coalition government of Prime Minister Netanyahu, propped up by far right settler parties, made compromise look all but impossible. Events of 7 October are seen by many as the final nail in the coffin of the two state dream. "I think every day that passes we are going further away from that," Mayor Oded says. "Israel actually evacuated all its citizens, all its civilian presence, all its military presence from the Gaza Strip under pressure from the international community. And what we got was a military army of Hamas." Of course, that suggestion will be met with fury, not to mention resistance, by many Palestinians. For them, as well as much of the international community, the Two State solution is the only one that is acceptable. They say anything else is predicated on the basis of the continued denial of rights and freedoms for millions of ordinary Palestinians. Back at the olive grove, just as the sun is dipping below the Church of the Nativity, I ask Ahmed what he is looking for in his future."Peace and security," comes his response. "To come and go with our cars, to see our children, to live in our country without problems… We're not looking for problems. We're looking to be able to feed our children, that's all."	
10/11/2023 01:35:00	Weeks into the war, how much closer is Israel to its goal? - BBC News	It's nearly two weeks since Israel launched its ground offensive into Gaza and more than a month since it began intensive air strikes against Hamas, all in response to the brutal attacks in Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed.Israel's stated military objective from the outset has been to destroy Hamas, militarily and politically. How much closer is it to achieving that goal, and is it achievable? As far as Israel is concerned, these are still early days - it has repeatedly said that this operation will be long and difficult. One senior Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official who spoke to the BBC used the analogy of a boxing match: "This is just round four of 15."No-one in Israel is saying exactly how long the war will last. Some point to the fact that it took nine months for Western-backed Iraqi forces to retake the city of Mosul from the Islamic State (IS)group in 2017. Israel may want to carry on fighting for several more months, though it may not control the timetable, as international pressure for pauses in the fighting or even a ceasefire are growing. So far, Israel says it has carried out more than 14,000 strikes and killed dozens of high-value targets, including senior Hamas commanders. Each of those strikes will have involved multiple weapons. Yaakov Katz, a military expert and former editor of the Jerusalem Post newspaper, says Israel has already fired more than 23,000 munitions. As a comparison, at the height of the battle for Mosul, Western allies dropped around 500 bombs a week on IS targets.More than 10,800 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 4,400 children.The military says its ground forces have successfully divided the Gaza Strip between north and south, and that its troops have surrounded Gaza City. It claims they are now "deep in the heart of the city", though that is still far from claiming control. Hamas has denied that Israeli forces have made any significant gains or pushed deep into Gaza City.This initial phase of Israel's ground offensive appears to be going according to plan with its aim of isolating Hamas, and the cost to Hamas is likely to have been high. Estimates at the start of the war suggested that the group had between 30,000-40,000 fighters. One senior Israeli defence source told the BBC that about 10% of that total - 4,000 fighters - have been killed. Such estimates are impossible to verify and should be treated with caution, but the sheer scale of Israel's bombing campaign will have already degraded Hamas's ability to fight.In contrast, Israeli military losses appear to have been relatively low. Israel says 34 of its soldiers have been killed since ground operations began. Yossi Kuperwasser, an Israeli intelligence and security expert, says the military is conducting its ground operations "more carefully and cautiously" to avoid heavy casualties among its troops.It's still not clear how much of Hamas remains in the north, how many fighters may still be hiding in tunnels, or how many might have melted into the local population who have fled south.The tunnels still present a significant challenge to Israel. Its forces are trying to blow up what tunnels it finds, rather than engage in fighting underground. More obvious is Israel's significant advantage in terms of intelligence and military capabilities. It can intercept communications and even turn off Gaza's mobile phone and internet networks. It has complete air superiority with Israeli jets and drones able to monitor every movement on the ground, but not below the surface.One senior Israeli defence source told the BBC that they were still identifying more than 100 new targets each day, although that list is likely to diminish the longer this war goes on. The longer it lasts, the more it will have to rely on troops on the ground to identify and eliminate resistance.Justin Crump, a former British Army officer who now runs Sibylline, a risk intelligence company, says Israel appears to be making reasonable progress given the density of the terrain, but "they're now going to encounter the more heavily defended urban areas of the city".Israeli troops are better equipped and well-trained, but urban warfare can still prove difficult for the most advanced militaries. So far, close-quarters fighting on the ground appears to have been limited, and is certainly nothing on the scale of the urban warfare that's been taking place between Russia and Ukraine in cities like Bakhmut. Much of the videos released by the IDF show that it is instead relying on tanks and armour.Neither has Israel committed all its forces. Some estimate that it may have as few as 30,000 troops inside Gaza so far. That's a relatively small proportion of Israel's total - 160,000 active military personnel plus 360,000 reservists. Justin Crump says the question is how many of its infantry is it willing to commit to clearing every building and the warren of Hamas tunnels? Israel could instead chose to target Hamas strongholds. He believes Israel will try to avoid block-by-block fighting, not least because it could lead to very heavy casualties. It would also certainly jeopardise the lives of more than 200 hostages. Which raises the question as to whether Israel's stated war aim - destroying Hamas - is really achievable. Even senior Israeli officials recognise that destroying an ideology with bombs and bullets is impossible. Some of the group's leadership isn't even in Gaza. Mr Katz says that if elements of Hamas can survive this war, then they could still claim "because we're still here, we've actually won". For that reason, Mr Crump believes Israel's war aims could shift from destroying Hamas to punishing it, to make sure it there is no repeat of the 7 October attacks.Israel is also under increasing pressure to explain what happens next, especially from the US. One Israeli defence source said Winston Churchill wasn't thinking about a Marshall plan to rebuild Germany, when he helped launched the allies invasion on D-Day in the Second World War. But wars are rarely won without a plan post-invasion - something that's been completely absent in Israel's military operation so far. 	
09/11/2023 23:03:00	US says Israel to begin daily four-hour military pauses in Gaza - BBC News	Israel will begin to implement daily four-hour military pauses in areas of northern Gaza, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.However Israel's defence minister stressed they were only "localised and pinpoint measures" that would "not detract from the war fighting".President Biden said there would be two "humanitarian passages" allowing people to leave areas of fighting.On Thursday heavy fighting was reported around two big hospitals in Gaza City.Meanwhile, pictures once again showed thousands of Palestinians fleeing south from the city and other northern areas.Mr Biden also said the US was trying to increase humanitarian supplies and assistance to Gaza. He said he was aiming for 150 trucks of aid per day to enter the territory.However the UN said the amount of aid entering Gaza was only meeting "a fraction" of people's needs and the humanitarian situation was "intolerable". A conference in Paris earlier heard repeated appeals for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israel has been bombarding Gaza for over a month and began a major ground offensive almost two weeks ago with the objective of destroying Hamas, which it, the US and other Western powers consider a terrorist organisation.The war began after an unprecedented cross-border assault on southern Israel by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 10,800 people have been killed in the territory since then, while 1.5 million have fled their homes.Mr Biden said Israel was "fighting an enemy embedded in the civilian population, which places innocent Palestinian people at risk" but that Israel had "an obligation to distinguish between terrorists and civilians and fully comply with international law".On Thursday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had raided Hamas's "military quarter" near Al-Shifa Hospital and killed 50 "terrorists".A witness said he had also seen tanks opening fire near Al-Quds Hospital.About 2,000 patients and 50,000 displaced people are said to be inside Al-Shifa Hospital, which is located in Gaza City's northern Rimal neighbourhood and is the largest medical complex in Gaza.Its director, Mohammed Abu Selmia, told the Associated Press that Israeli troops were about 3km (2 miles) away and that conditions there were "disastrous in every sense of the word". In footage filmed inside the hospital on Thursday, a man who was accompanied by two children tells a journalist that they had been walking on a street, trying to flee south, when an Israeli tank opened fire at them."The remains of seven or eight martyrs were left at the scene," he says.An unverified video posted on social media overnight also purportedly showed a number of people being helped after being hit by shrapnel from a shell on a street close to Al-Shifa.The IDF has previously alleged that Hamas is also operating underground command centres beneath Al-Shifa itself. Hamas and hospital staff have denied the accusation.Fierce battles were also reported on Thursday around Al-Quds hospital, which is 2.3km (1.4 miles) to the south-west in the Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood.Hamouda Musa, 34, told the BBC he and his neighbour had escaped from a building opposite the hospital after he saw four tanks and a bulldozer advancing from the coast, 1km away to the north. "They were firing intensely towards a nearby residential building," he said. "We fled under a barrage of bullets via a back street. We miraculously came back from the dead."On Wednesday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said that areas in close proximity were struck, injuring patients and displaced people, and damaging buildings.The hospital also said on Wednesday that its main generator had been shut down because of a shortage of fuel, forcing it to close its surgical ward, oxygen generation plant and MRI ward.The clashes and strikes in the north, as well as the struggle to secure enough drinking water and food to survive, has prompted some of the several hundred thousands of civilians staying there to flee southwards in recent days.Pictures from drones showed a stream of people walking along Salah al-Din Road and crossing the Wadi Gaza river, after the IDF opened the route for a sixth consecutive day. An estimated 50,000 people fled the north on Wednesday, which was 10 times more than on Monday.Although the IDF has ordered civilians to move south of Wadi Gaza for their own safety, it has continued to carry out strikes on what it says are Hamas targets in areas where hundreds of thousands have sought refuge.The Hamas-run interior ministry in Gaza said 12 people had been killed and many more injured in an Israeli air strike on a house in the central town of Deir al-Balah on Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the IDF.While visiting Egypt's Rafah Crossing with Gaza on Wednesday, UN human rights chief Volker Türk said both sides in the conflict had committed war crimes. "The atrocities perpetrated by Palestinian armed groups on 7 October were heinous, they were war crimes - as is the continued holding of hostages.""The collective punishment by Israel of Palestinian civilians amounts also to a war crime, as does the unlawful forcible evacuation of civilians. The massive bombardments by Israel have killed, maimed and injured in particular women and children," he added.Israel has insisted it has been acting in complete compliance with international law and that it has done everything possible to minimise civilian casualties.It has also rejected the UN's warnings of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, arguing that there is sufficient food, water and fuel despite the "complete siege" it imposed in response to Hamas's attack, and has rejected its calls for a ceasefire unless the hostages are released.The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, told the Paris conference on Gaza that there had to be a ceasefire so that more aid could be delivered.He called the volume currently coming through Rafah "blatantly inadequate".A total of 756 lorries have crossed from Egypt since 21 October. Before the war, an average of 500 lorry loads entered Gaza every working day from Egypt and Israel.	
09/11/2023 19:20:00	Jenin raid: 14 Palestinians killed in clashes in West Bank city - BBC News	Fourteen Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry says.It said at least 20 others were injured in the assault, which residents said involved two drone strikes.It is one of the deadliest recent incidents of its kind in Jenin, which has been repeatedly raided by Israel as part of a drive against militants.The Israeli military said it had sent in undercover units to arrest suspects.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched an assault on the camp overnight, using armoured bulldozers to destroy homemade bombs. Troops came under fire and a drone was used to attack a group of gunmen, the IDF said. The bulldozers ripped up the already badly damaged streets. The IDF said troops re-entered the camp hours later, coming under renewed gunfire. Another drone was used to attack gunmen again, it said. During the clashes, the air force reportedly dropped leaflets telling residents: "The IDF remains here and will return again and again until terrorism is completely eradicated. Stay away from terrorism, live in peace," the Jerusalem Post newspaper reported.The Israeli military has been carrying out near nightly arrest raids across the West Bank for a year and a half, following a wave of deadly attacks by Palestinians which killed more than 30 Israelis.According to the UN, this year more than 400 Palestinians - both militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank, making it the deadliest there since the UN began recording Palestinian fatalities in 2005.A number of Palestinian attackers have come from Jenin, which has become a major base for Palestinian militants in the West Bank.Four Palestinians were killed in other parts of the West Bank, Palestinian health officials said.Israeli-Palestinian tensions in the West Bank, which were already high, have been fuelled further by the war in Gaza, which began after an unprecedented deadly attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen on 7 October. More than 150 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed in the West Bank since the war began.	
09/11/2023 19:02:00	Ecologist tracks birds of prey to find Israeli dead - BBC News	An ecologist is using birds of prey to help Israel's army recover dead bodies at the sites where Hamas attacked on 7 October.Ohad Hatzofe, of Israel's Nature and Parks Authority, tracks the migratory patterns of numerous birds using GPS tracking devices. His data helped to locate four corpses after he was asked for help on 23 October. Another bird found a few other locations of interest, Mr Hatzofe said. The Israeli ecologist said he first reviewed the data of a white-tailed eagle that had been born in Israel. It was hatched in the country in an effort to reintroduce the bird after its species' extinction in the region. It had just returned very hungry from a long migration north of Moscow and proved to be a keen searcher. Mr Hatzofe reviewed its movements and chose certain positions where it had stopped. He then shared that data with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which found the four corpses.The IDF did not respond to BBC News' request for comment. An estimated 1,500 Hamas gunman breached the Gaza Strip's perimeter fence in southern Israel on 7 October and systemically attacked nearby Jewish communities and military posts. An outdoor music festival was also targeted. The attacks saw more than 1,400 people killed, and more than 200 people were taken hostage. More than 10,800 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 4,400 children.Mr Hatzofe said he tracks where the birds stop with GPS tracking devices. While the trackers do not have video, they can tell him how the bird is moving, what elevation it is at and other data points that can suggest areas of interest. He then cross-references that information with satellite imagery. The ecologist said it was very fulfilling to help the effort, particularly as it can help answer lingering questions for the victims' families. "To live in this uncertainty and know that some might never be found is the worst thing on earth," he said.Mr Hatzofe is also living in that uncertainty. He said his friend Ohad Yahalomi and Yahalomi's 12-year-old are still missing after Hamas attacked their home in Nir Oz, a kibbutz in southern Israel. Mr Yaholomi was shot during the assault and has not been seen since. His wife, who has spoken to the press, and two youngest children were able to escape."It is very sad," said Mr Hatzofe, who hopes to soon join the search for the dead in person. He also hopes that the war will end soon, as it has caused harm to Israelis and Palestinians. But while many in Israel can disagree about politics in times of peace, he emphasised that they work together during wartime."When there is danger, we are all working together toward the same goal," Mr Hatzofe said. There are few remaining to do the work that Mr Hatzofe does since Hamas's attack, because so many of his colleagues have been called up for military service. So for now, he said he is happy to "use my knowledge of the movement of birds and their behaviour to help wherever we can". 	
09/11/2023 18:57:00	Israel sees 'sign of life' in Gaza hostage video - BBC News	The armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group has posted videos of two Israeli hostages held in Gaza.  The group said it was prepared to release a 77-year-old woman and a 13-year-old boy for humanitarian and medical reasons, but only if "appropriate measures" were met. Israel described the videos as an important sign of life, but declined to say whether they would be released.That would play into the captors' "psychological terror", it said.In the video, the two hostages are seen addressing the camera.The woman, Hanna Katsir, a woman in her 70s, is seen sitting in a wheelchair. She was abducted from kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October, when Hamas attacked Israel.The second is a teenage boy from the same community.Both hostages sharply criticise Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. It is unclear whether they are reading from a script. The BBC will not be broadcasting the clip itself, which is more than three minutes long. Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law, and the BBC does not broadcast material which may have been filmed under duress.Earlier, the Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, dismissed reports that a deal to free some of the hostages held in Gaza might be imminent.The Israeli military says that 242 people are being held hostage in Gaza. Four hostages have been released and another was freed by Israeli forces.Hamas says it has hidden the hostages it holds in "safe places and tunnels" within Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have previously said the hostages include 20 children and between 10 and 20 over-60s.Mr Herzog said on Thursday he had not seen any substantial information on the subject of possible releases.  He spoke as the Qatari prime minister hosted a meeting in Doha with the heads of the CIA and Mossad, during which they reportedly discussed the possible terms of a deal for more hostages to be freed.Meanwhile two senior Hamas officials, Ismail Haniyeh and Khaled Meshaal, arrived in Cairo, where reports suggested they met the head of Egyptian intelligence Abbas Kamel.Qatari and Egyptian networks have both said that the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, is expected to visit Cairo tomorrow.	
09/11/2023 18:17:00	Daughter of doctor stuck in Gaza blames UK embassy - BBC News	The daughter of a Swansea cardiologist is blaming British Embassy staff for him being stuck in Gaza.Ahmed Sabra, a UK citizen who holds a British passport, was visiting Gaza with family when the conflict started.They waited three weeks for the Egypt crossing to open and, while his loved ones were on the approved list of British nationals, Dr Sabra was not.The Foreign Office said it had no control over the authorities involved.Thousands of foreign nationals have been making the same trip but the only those named on a list published daily by the Gaza Border Authority are allowed to cross over. Those on the list must be cleared by both Egyptian and Israeli authorities.Dr Sabra's daughter Haya, 20, said embassy staff didn't act fast enough to help her father who, after a further three days' wait, was still not added to the list.Instead, he and three other UK residents were loaded onto a bus and sent back to the Gaza side on Tuesday."We were assured by the embassy that those four people on the bus would not go back to Gaza," said Haya."The British government team arrived 20 minutes too late to save them."They weren't there - if they had been this would not have happened."The BBC team in Gaza spoke to Dr Sabra on Wednesday after he had crossed back over the border. He claimed embassy staff could still have done something while the bus waited for hours at the Egyptian side of the Rafah Crossing, but they arrived too late."They (Egyptian officials) told the two guys from the British Embassy, 'We gave you five hours to sort this out so that your citizens are clear to enter, you didn't do anything'," said Dr Sabra, adding that despite his journey being delayed until the following morning, subsequent chances were also missed to rectify the situation."We were calling everyone from the British Embassy, but nobody turned up to the crossing. "In the end the officials said, 'We are sorry, we have to send you back'. "'Your name is not on the list and your embassy needs to sort this out'."He said he believes the UK government should "do their duty to protect me". "I am a British citizen and I don't believe they did enough, I don't think they even did the minimum. "The British Embassy sent me back to Gaza - the most dangerous place in the world now.Dr Sabra's medical colleagues have written a joint letter calling on the UK government to do more to help him, and a petition urging the FCDO to do more has been signed by more than 4,600 people. Haya, along with her mother, sister and younger brother, waited in a hotel at Cairo International Airport for their father, but Egyptian officials only let them stay in the country for 72 hours and they were put on a flight back to the UK on Thursday evening.Her last contact with her father was this morning when he urged them to get on the plane."I don't know where he is, I don't know if he is safe, I don't know if he has water, if there is bombing nearby," she said."I don't want to go back to the UK. I don't know how I am supposed to go back without my dad, to this shameful government, knowing they sent him back to a death trap."A FCDO spokesperson said: "We're working round the clock to ensure all British nationals in Gaza who want to leave are able to."This involves submitting all details of British nationals and eligible dependants to the Israeli and Egyptian authorities."The authorities then review all cases and give permissions to cross. "We remain in regular contact with British Nationals in Gaza to provide them with the latest information, and UK teams are forward deployed to the border to receive anyone leaving."	
09/11/2023 17:57:00	India appeals death sentences of ex-naval officers in Qatar - BBC News	India has filed an appeal with Qatar over death sentences handed to eight former Indian naval officers on unspecified charges.Reports say the men, who worked with a private company in Qatar, were arrested last year on suspicion of spying.Neither Qatar nor India have revealed the specific charges against them.India's external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India has "already filed an appeal" against the verdict.The ministry added that it had consular access to the detainees on Tuesday. The Indian government said last month it was "deeply shocked" and would take up the verdict with Qatari authorities.The foreign ministrydescribes the men as employees of a private company called Al Dahra, but they have been widely reported to be former personnel of the Indian Navy. Last year, in parliament, foreign minister S Jaishankar described them as "ex-servicemen" of the country. The families of some of the men have also confirmed their identities and background in the navy to local media.Their arrest in August last year made front-page headlines in India, but there has been little confirmed information about the charges against them.According to The Hindu newspaper, the men were allegedly accused of "breaching sensitive secrets", but neither governments have confirmed this. Experts say the recent diplomatic tensions could impact relations between the two countries. In December, Mr Jaishankar told parliament the government was in constant touch with Qatar over the "very sensitive case".Millions of Indians live in the Gulf, with tens of thousands of them working in semi-skilled and unskilled low-income jobs.These migrant workers have played a key role in building the economies of Gulf Arab states and also form an important source of remittances for India.	
09/11/2023 14:36:00	Football fan's photo gesture for 14-year-old boy in Gaza - BBC News	A 14-year-old boy in Gaza was able to momentarily "forget about the bombs" after a fellow football fan took his photograph to Anfield.Ali fears he will be killed before he has the chance to visit the home of Liverpool FC.His older brother Abubaker arranged the surprise to help put a smile on his face amid the ongoing conflict. Abubaker said his family never imagined this could be possible after reaching out for help on social media.Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking hostages.More than 10,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel responded with air strikes and a ground offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry."During the war, I was afraid," Abubaker said in voice notes sent to the BBC."I said at some point, probably all of a sudden, out of the blue, we're going to be bombed and Ali will be killed and I'm going to be killed. "We're not an exception in this little strip that we're going to be surviving this war yet again. "We've survived four wars. And this war may not be another one we survive."In a bid to make his brother's dreams come true, he messaged Ben on The Anfield Talk podcast."Ali is so crazy about Liverpool, he's so obsessed with Liverpool," said Abubaker."He watches every game, he loves the players, he loves Salah, he loves everyone.  "It's his dream to get to Anfield."Ben quickly agreed to help, adding: "I will do anything at all from my end if it can help somebody just a little bit."He arranged for his friend Sajad to print out the photograph, put it in a frame and take it to famous landmarks around the ground."I then sent the pictures across to Abubaker and his response was heartbreaking," he said."He said that he hasn't stopped smiling, and that for a few moments they as a family completely forgot about the bombs and that it's a historic moment in their family history."Sajad decided to take the picture to the stadium on Wednesday ahead of the latest fixture."I'm a lifelong Red and someone lucky to travel to every home and away game," he said."I wanted to make a fellow Red's dream come true by taking a picture at the ground. "With everything happening in Palestine right now, I didn't want to wait until Sunday's game because anything can happen until then.

Aaron Kader, from Maidenhead, found out 15 days later his uncle was one of those killed when he was identified through DNA.He said:  "We still do not know how he died, all we know is that his home was completely burnt to the ground."Israel has been bombarding Gaza for more than a month and launched a major ground offensive in response to the attack by Hamas gunmen in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage.Mr Karol was born in Israel, he lived with his wife and daughter in the kibbutz. They managed to escape and are now "safe and relocated", said Mr Kader.After confirming Mr Karol's death, his nephew said he "was a huge part of our family, the life and soul of it"."He was a larger than life character, who had the ability to make us all laugh," he added."The hardest part was waiting and hoping to hear if he had managed to escape, hide somewhere or was kidnapped like many others."Some 240 people are thought to be held: Israelis and foreigners, soldiers and civilians and old and young. Demonstrations and pleas to bring them home are becoming more urgent.Mr Kader hopes "those kidnapped are safely returned to their families" and "hopes the country can find peace".Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

09/11/2023 12:56:00	Israel-Gaza war: Dead bodies and tanks on road south as people flee - BBC News	Civilians fleeing intense fighting in northern Gaza have described seeing decomposing bodies and Israeli tanks along a designated "safe road".The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has told people - via social media and leaflets - to use the Salah al-Din road between specific times of day.So what is this journey like?BBC Verify has been looking at video, listening to eyewitness testimony and analysing satellite images to try to get a clearer picture. Before the fighting started, northern Gaza was home to over one million people.It has been heavily bombed and Israeli ground forces are now fighting Hamas there, following the group's attack on Israel on 7 October.Salah al-Din is the main road crossing the length of Gaza and the Israeli military has told civilians to use it as an evacuation route. The road runs past Wadi Gaza, a valley the IDF uses to divide northern and southern Gaza. The IDF has said people will be safer in southern Gaza although its air strikes there have continued.On Wednesday Ahmed Zeyadah told a local journalist filming for the BBC about his journey. He had travelled from his home in the district of al-Nasr in the north.Carrying his toddler, he said, "I am so tired. We don't know what to do, we don't know where to go. To whom do we turn? To whom do we say: Come and save us."Mahmoud Ghazzaawi fled his home in al-Zeitoun in northern Gaza because of the number of attacks.He said he left his home at midday and had been walking for five hours. He also said he did not know where to go."There are martyrs [dead people] thrown on the ground, may God have mercy on them," he said.Most people appear to be walking. According to the UN, the Israeli military reportedly forced evacuees to leave vehicles at the southern edge of Gaza City. Those travelling from the furthest point north walked up to 12 miles (20km).One of the evacuees told UN observers: "I saw a lot of damage on my way, I saw Israeli tanks and soldiers positioned at the eastern side of the road, near Netzarim, and they did not approach us. "I saw a few dead bodies and body parts on the road."In another video, posted on the messaging app Telegram on Tuesday, a woman talked about bodies on the highway. She said she had been looking for her son near the Netzarim junction - named after the former Israeli settlement in Gaza that was located nearby - and described finding his body lying in the road among others as she travelled south."I saw the Israeli tanks, but I didn't care, I looked around and found my son. I recognised him by his belt, and his phone," she said on the video.The BBC spoke to a local journalist who recognised the woman and said she had visited the Al Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, on Tuesday where she registered the death of her son. He was buried on the same day, he said.The BBC has not found video footage or still images of bodies on the Salah al-Din highway in recent days. We have asked the IDF to comment on the reports of bodies there. The UN estimates up to 15,000 people made the journey on Tuesday, with around 5,000 the day before.On Wednesday the Israeli military said it was opening the road for an extra hour until 15:00 local time because large numbers of people were using it. A military spokesman later claimed as many as 50,000 people had left northern Gaza along Salah al-Din Road on Wednesday.The IDF has published video footage on X showing groups of people walking along the road, some of them waving white flags (to show they are civilians), with an Israeli tank next to the highway and facing them. The BBC has verified the location - by matching distinctive buildings seen in the background of the shot, and it is on the Salah al-Din road about 3km north of Wadi Gaza.Satellite imagery of the highway - posted on 7 November - shows people walking along the same stretch of road and an IDF tank next to it. The image also shows damage to buildings alongside the Salah al-Din road and what appears to be debris on the road.Another satellite image from the same date shows a larger group of people walking along the road around 0.6 miles (1km) north of Wadi Gaza. Israeli tanks have been spotted on this key road before.On 30 October, the BBC verified footage of a tank firing near a car - trying to reverse away - followed by a large explosion.We asked the IDF whether - at the time of this incident - the road has been designated as "safe".It would not comment on this specific incident, but said Salah al-Din "had been an open road throughout the war" and they had been "securing it with ground troops and tanks to encourage safe evacuation".BBC Verify has also analysed satellite imagery of the Salah al-Din Road - as far as Wadi Gaza - to try to assess the level of damage to it during this conflict.Every red dot represents damage of some kind on the road: for example, a crater on the tarmac or a building damaged next to the highway. We have identified about 60 individual examples but we cannot tell exactly when these occurred.

09/11/2023 12:45:00	UK accused of 'whitewash' after Chevening scholar feared killed in Gaza - BBC News	A Palestinian doctor who graduated from a prestigious UK Foreign Office scholarship scheme is feared to have been killed along with most of his family in an Israeli air strike in Gaza, colleagues say. Dr Maisara Al Rayyes, 30, was photographed with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly after meeting him alongside other graduates of the programme two months ago.He was trapped under the rubble of a six-storey apartment building which was razed to the ground in Gaza City on Sunday night. The UK's handling of the case has triggered anger among some Foreign Office staff, the BBC understands, amid wider complaints over a failure to explicitly highlight the spiralling civilian death toll in Gaza. It has also sparked a fierce backlash from some of the medic's former colleagues and scholarship members. Dr Al Rayyes was a graduate of the Chevening Scholarship scheme, an elite programme run by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). The scheme is seen as a pillar of British diplomatic prowess, funding places at UK universities for overseas applicants it describes as global "leaders and decision-makers" of the future.  More than 15 Chevening graduates have gone on to become heads of state. The story of Dr Al Rayyes, who won funding for a master's degree in health at King's College London, was embraced by the Foreign Office especially as he met his fiancée, another Chevening scholar, via the programme. In September he was chosen among a select group of graduates to meet the Foreign Secretary in Jerusalem. On Monday, Dr Al Rayyes's parents and a nephew were found dead in the rubble of the family home, friends say, while Dr Al Rayyes himself is yet to be recovered. It has not been possible for BBC journalists to visit the scene to verify what happened on the ground. Videos of the aftermath show the apartment block completely collapsed, with the concrete structure of each floor compressed into the next, forming a vast area of compacted wreckage and tangled metal.The Israeli military declined to respond to questions about the incident.On Wednesday morning, the BBC attempted to make contact with Dr Al Rayyes's younger brother Moayed who was said to have witnessed the strike from a neighbouring house. He was spending a third day along with another sibling searching for Dr Al Rayyes in the rubble. But on Wednesday afternoon while still trying to reach their brother, Moayed and his older sibling Mohammed Al Rayyes were killed in another blast on the street, family friends say.Video showed their bodies on top of the wreckage. A local journalist documenting the rescue scene was also wounded.  The Foreign Office on Wednesday said it was "devastated" and offered condolences to the surviving family and "Chevening Alumni community" over the death of Dr Al Rayyes but didn't give any details about what happened to him, or where. The post triggered a storm of criticism from users on X, previously known as Twitter, including from some of his former medical colleagues who accused the UK of trying to avoid any criticism of Israel.The handling of his case also sparked "huge amounts of discontent" among some UK officials who felt the death announcement was not placed in context, according to accounts of events described to the BBC.It is also understood "staff counsellors" in the Foreign Office have been collating internal concerns raised about the government's position on the Israel-Hamas war, and briefing senior officials on their contents. These have included claims the government has shown a permissive approach to Israel "breaching international humanitarian law" given the unprecedented scale of the civilian death toll in Gaza, and that this could damage wider foreign policy, for example, when it comes to highlighting breaches of the global rules-based order by Russia in Ukraine. On Monday, a group representing Chevening graduates in 28 countries wrote to the foreign secretary pleading with him to protect their colleagues and "focus on the needs and safety of Chevening Alumni" in Gaza and "work towards an immediate ceasefire". One Chevening graduate has since accused the Foreign Office of whitewashing Dr Al Rayyes's death.  Hala Hanini, a Chevening graduate and close friend of Dr Al Rayyes, told the BBC it was "disgusting, disappointing and outrageous" that the government tweeted its sympathies but did not raise any questions over how he was killed. "It's as if he just died of normal things," she said. "[UK ministers] claim that Israel has the right to self defence but… it actually has responsibilities over the occupied people to provide them with safety, security… [instead] they are committing genocide and calling it in a false way self-defence," she said, accusing the UK of failing to uphold international law. Asked about the concerns raised, the FCDO declined to comment, telling the BBC "we wouldn't have anything to add beyond the tweet" about Dr Al Rayyes. In Gaza more than 10,500 Palestinians have been killed in just over a month according to the health ministry in the territory, which is governed by Hamas and has been blockaded by Israel and Egypt since 2007. The UK government has previously given its "unequivocal" support to Israel saying it has a "right to defend itself" following the 7 October attacks by Hamas which saw 1,400 people killed and more than 240 taken hostage. The UK has also called on Israel to observe international humanitarian law in its response. Israel says its strikes have targeted "Hamas terrorists and infrastructure", blaming the group for deaths of civilians by using them as "human shields". Many Palestinians accuse the Israeli military of deliberately targeting civilians in order to add to the pressure on Hamas. Israel has said it will not agree to any pause in the fighting until hostages are released.	
09/11/2023 11:45:00	Suspects held over alleged Hezbollah plot in Brazil - BBC News	An alleged plot to attack Jews in Brazil has been foiled following the arrest of two men suspected of being linked to the Islamist group Hezbollah.The arrests were made in São Paulo on Wednesday during what police said was an operation to "disrupt the preparation of terrorist attacks".  Brazilian authorities added other raids were carried out across the country.The Israeli Prime Minister's office said its spy agency Mossad worked with Brazilian law enforcement.Brazil is home to Latin America's second largest Jewish community.In a statement, Brazil's Federal Police said 11 search and seizure raids were executed in São Paulo, the capital Brasília and the state of Minas Gerais.Recruiters face charges of involvement in a terrorist organisation and participating in preparations for terrorist acts - and could face maximum prison sentences of 15 and a half years if convicted.Hezbollah is an Iranian-backed Shia Muslim organisation which exerts significant political influence in Lebanon and controls the country's most powerful armed force.Like Hamas in the Gaza Strip, it is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK, the US, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and other nations.According to AFP news agency, Mossad said it had helped to "foil a terrorist attack in Brazil" which it added was "planned by the Hezbollah terrorist organisation, directed and financed by the Iranian regime".In a statement, Mossad said the planned attacks targeted "Israeli and Jewish targets in Brazil"."This was an extensive network that operated in additional countries," Mossad added.While Mossad did not name the other countries, security experts have long tracked alleged Hezbollah operations in South America's "tri-border area" between Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay."Given the backdrop of the war in Gaza... Hezbollah and the Iranian regime are continuing to operate around the world in order to attack Israeli, Jewish and Western targets," Mossad's statement added.Although Brazil may seem a long way from the Middle East, the region's conflicts have long cast a shadow over South America.In neighbouring Argentina, which has one of the largest Jewish communities in the world, Hezbollah has been blamed for the country's deadliest terror attack - the 1994 bombing of the Amia Jewish cultural centre in Buenos Aires, in which 85 people died.Hezbollah and Iran have both denied any involvement. No-one has ever been brought to trial in connection with the bombing.Both Brazil and Argentina have many citizens of Syrian or Lebanese descent, although the majority of them are Christians.More than 100,000 Jewish people live in Brazil, while twice that number live in Argentina.Argentina designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation in 2019, making it the first country in Latin America to do so.It was followed by Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras and Paraguay - but not, as yet, Brazil.	
09/11/2023 10:59:00	When can protesting over the Gaza war be illegal in the UK? - BBC News	On 7 October Hamas gunmen launched an attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip, killing more than 1,200 people and taking more than 220 hostages.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 14,800 people have been killed in the territory since Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes.Support and solidarity for both parties in the war is being expressed across the UK.Over the past two weekends, tens of thousands of people have attended pro-Palestinian marches in London.The BBC has been answering your questions about what your rights are when it comes to protesting and showing support.According to the government's website, individuals are allowed to fly a flag on private property as long as it meets standard conditions such as it being in a safe location and not obscuring roads or railways.It states that any country's national flag does not need consent to be flown. However, any flag that makes reference to a proscribed organisation under the Terrorism Act cannot be flown legally. The UK government currently has a list of 79 proscribed international terrorist groups, which includes Hamas and Hezbollah.This means individuals are not allowed to fly a Hamas or Hezbollah flag on private property or in public.The BBC has been made aware of instances where police officers have warned people with a Palestinian flag on their private property that they could be in breach of the Public Order Act. Under the Act, someone can be found guilty of an offence if they have "intent to cause a person harassment, alarm or distress".Peter Walker, a human right's solicitor, explained to the BBC: "There are no laws that ban any country's national flag to be hung on private property." While the UK does not recognise Palestine as an independent state, Mr Walker said it was "a partially recognised sovereign state amongst the international community" as 138 of the UN's 193 member states recognise it. He added: "If police are called to a property they have the right to make inquiries, but equally, unless they specify that you are committing an offence and will arrest you, you have the right to ignore them and close the door."The Met Police said: "Displaying a Palestinian flag on its own isn't a criminal offence, however it can be if there are aggravating factors."When asked about the aggravating factors, the Met said these would be "assessed on a case-by-case basis".Generally speaking, your right to wave a flag is protected under the European Convention of Human Rights, which guarantees individuals' rights to freedom of expression. In a written reply to the BBC, Mr Walker said it would be "extremely unlikely that waving a Palestinian (or Israeli) flag could ever be construed as intending to glorify acts of terrorism, but said the important thing to remember was context". He added: "Waving a flag or bearing a symbol in a deliberately offensive and provocative way could lead to an arrest. Whether it would hold up in court is probably a different matter."Home Secretary Suella Braverman has written to chief constables in England and Wales to suggest that some instances of waving a Palestinian flag or chanting may be a criminal offence. She said: "Behaviours that are legitimate in some circumstances, for example the waving of a Palestinian flag, may not be legitimate such as when intended to glorify acts of terrorism."Nor is it acceptable to drive through Jewish neighbourhoods, or single out Jewish members of the public, to aggressively chant or wave pro-Palestinian symbols at. "Where harassment is identified, I would encourage the police to take swift and appropriate enforcement action."The Met Police later published a statement saying "the waving of a particular flag is not, in itself, a specific criminal offence unless it relates to a proscribed organisation". Since protests began three weeks ago in London, 100 people have been arrested, according to the Met.On Saturday 28 October, five people at a central London pro-Palestinian demonstration of 70,000 were charged - two were accused of racially aggravated offences, another two of public order offences and another was charged with causing actual bodily harm.It is not clear if the public order offence charges related to waving a flag or chanting, but Mr Walker said he did not believe an "arrest on that basis alone would ever hold up or result in a conviction".During the protest, some people chanted "from the river to the sea", referring to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean.Ms Braverman had previously urged police chiefs to consider interpreting those words as an "expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world".The Palestinian Solidarity Campaign and other activists have contested this, saying the slogan refers to "the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice".Further chants, including "chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map" and chanting "jihad" have been identified by Ms Braverman as ones that police forces should take action on.It is important to remember that the police and Crown Prosecution Service are operationally independent from the government, meaning decisions on what might constitute law-breaking lie with them.Police are due to receive "clarified" guidance on hate crimes after Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said officers' hands are tied by laws on hate speech.He said his force was "ruthless in tackling anybody who puts their foot over the legal line", but argued hate crime laws "probably need redrawing" because extremists groups were able to spread "truly toxic messages" messages without breaking the law.The BBC recently reported that Palestinian flags were being removed from lamp-posts on streets in east London after concerns were raised with police.According to accounts on social media, nearly every lamp-post on Bow Road in Tower Hamlets had a flag attached.At the time the Met said no offence had been committed but Transport for London (TfL), which is responsible for the roads, said it was "swiftly removing them". The Met has also removed posters of Israeli hostages put up in Edgware, north London. Mr Walker said there was the "potential" of being arrested if you commit criminal damage which is defined as "deliberate or reckless damage" of property without lawful excuse. This could include putting flags, stickers or symbols on public property, but he said "attaching a flag to a lamp-post is very unlikely to be considered criminal damage provided it does not damage the light post and can easily be removed".He added, however, that "police often do arrest protesters for criminal damage on fairly weak grounds, including for using chalk on pavement, for example".Since 7 October, the Premier League has updated its guidance on flag flying at football matches.It says Israeli and Palestinian flags, displays, banners and scarves should not be displayed.Scottish football club Celtic has been fined by Uefa after a fan group defied the club's appeal and held aloft Palestinian flags before a Champions League match on 25 October.Tottenham Hotspur fans have also been told by the club not to bring Israeli flags to matches. Several supporters were spotted with the flag during a match against Fulham on 23 October.Guidance on whether fans flouting this rule will be removed from the stadium is still unclear.The BBC will continue to update the article to reflect new developments.Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

09/11/2023 09:12:00	Iran-backed Yemeni rebels shoot down US drone - BBC News	Yemen's Houthi rebels have shot down a US military drone, US officials and the Iran-aligned Houthi movement have said. A US official said an MQ9 drone was shot down off the Yemeni coast by Houthi forces. This was confirmed by a Houthi military spokesman. It comes as Washington is on alert for activity by Iran-backed groups in the Middle East as its close ally Israel - Iran's main adversary - battles Hamas in the Gaza Strip.Last month, a US navy warship intercepted cruise missiles and several drones launched by the Houthis from Yemen towards Israel. The US has moved military assets, including aircraft carriers, Marines and support ships, to the Middle East in the wake of regional tensions surrounding the Israel-Gaza war. This includes troops being stationed onboard military vessels in the Red Sea, which lies between Yemen and Israel. Yemen's Houthi rebels are backed by Iran, and have been locked in a prolonged civil war with Yemen's official government - supported by another Iran rival, Saudi Arabia - since 2014. The deputy leader of another Iran-backed group in the region, Lebanon's Hezbollah, told the BBC this week that Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza risks wider war in the Middle East. Sheikh Naim Qassem said that "very serious and very dangerous developments could occur in the region, and no one would be able to stop the repercussions". Meanwhile, the US also said on Wednesday that it had carried out strikes against a facility in eastern Syria that it said was used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated groups.A Pentagon official said the strikes, the second in recent weeks, were in response to attacks against US forces in Iraq and Syria."While we are seeing an uptick in attacks, our purpose is to ensure that this conflict doesn't widen out beyond Israel," Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters regarding American deterrence efforts.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said the strike killed nine people affiliated with Iran-backed groups in Syria, a figure that could not be independently confirmed.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.

08/11/2023 21:11:00	Appeal to help West Yorkshire cardiologist trapped in Gaza - BBC News	Colleagues of a doctor who works in West Yorkshire and was refused permission to leave Gaza have appealed for his safe return.Ahmed Sabra, a consultant cardiologist at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, was visiting relatives when the war with Israel began.However, at the Rafah border he was told he could not enter Egypt.Hospital colleagues said they want "everything possible to be done" to return him to the UK.Dr Sabra, who is also an NHS consultant in Swansea, had been waiting to leave Gaza for a month. However, his name was not on an approved list of foreign nationals allowed to leave, forcing him to be separated from his wife and three children, who escaped to Egypt.He told the BBC he is happy that his family are safe, but claimed the UK government had "not done enough" to help him and has pleaded with them to help him leave. "I'm calling on the Foreign Office to do their duty for a British national, to evacuate me and get me out of Gaza," he said.A group of consultant cardiologists who work with Dr Sabra at Pinderfields have called for his return to the UK and described him as "a valued member of our team, providing acute cardiac care for patients in West Yorkshire"."We are extremely concerned for his welfare," they said. The group from the Mid Yorkshire Teaching NHS Trust said: "We have been in regular contact with him and it is clear he and his family have experienced unthinkable trauma and suffering, including losing family and friends. "As he is a British national, we expected his safe passage across the border and we were thrilled to hear that he and his family had made it through the Rafah crossing into Egypt."To then find out he has been sent back to Gaza was devastating to his colleagues, friends and patients here."Dr Sabra's colleagues said they believed the Foreign Office was aware of his plight."We have no political axe to grind, we just want everything possible to be done as quickly as possible to get our dear friend and colleague home safe," they said.Dr Sabra told the BBC: "We are now being sent to a death sentence."We're seeing death every day, we smell death, the sound of death and we felt like we died one hundred times."A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We're working round the clock to ensure all British nationals in Gaza who want to leave are able to."This involves submitting all details of British nationals and eligible dependants to the Israeli and Egyptian authorities. The authorities then review all cases and give permissions to cross. "We remain in regular contact with British nationals in Gaza to provide them with the latest information, and UK teams are forward deployed to the border to receive anyone leaving".Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

08/11/2023 21:10:00	Holiday couple died of carbon monoxide poisoning, inquest hears - BBC News	A pathologist has told an inquest that a British couple who suddenly fell ill after staying in an Egyptian hotel room died of carbon monoxide poisoning.But experts could not be sure of the source of the poisonous gas that killed John Cooper, 69, and his wife Susan, 63, Blackburn Coroner's Court heard.The couple, from Burnley, Lancashire, died suddenly on 21 August 2018 after becoming ill.They were staying at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada.A statement from a German tourist read at the inquest said there was a bed bug infestation in the room next door to the Coopers which was treated with a pesticide, referred to as Lambda, at lunchtime, with the Coopers falling ill in the early hours and dying the next day.The two rooms had an adjoining door, but this was kept locked.Home Office pathologist Dr Charles Wilson gave a cause of death for Mr Cooper as carbon monoxide toxicity and heart disease, and carbon monoxide toxicity for Mrs Cooper.Toxicology expert Professor Robert Chilcott told the hearing he detected the presence of carbon monoxide in blood samples from the bodies of the couple but he could not be certain of the levels.He said the levels were sufficient to suggest "severe exposure" to carbon monoxide.Prof Chilcott suggested in less developed countries the pesticide Lambda is sometimes diluted with another substance, dichloromethane, which causes the body to metabolise or ingest carbon monoxide.He added a 10-hour exposure duration would be "sufficient to cause carbon monoxide poisoning."He also said there were occupational limits in the UK about how much you are able to inhale and spraying it, as in the hotel room, would "rapidly exceed" those exposure limits.Dr Nick Gent, a former senior medical adviser to Public Health England, said he agreed on the presence of carbon monoxide in the Coopers' blood but had no idea about the source.Earlier Kelly Ormerod, the Coopers' daughter, described her parents as fit and healthy for their age and said they had been enjoying a "brilliant" holiday with her, their three grandchildren and family friends.Mr Cooper, a builder, and his wife, Susan, a cashier at a bureau de change in a Thomas Cook travel agent, were found seriously ill in their room by Ms Ormerod after they failed to emerge for breakfast.Her father was declared dead on the hotel room floor and his wife in hospital hours later.The hearing was adjourned until Friday.

08/11/2023 21:08:00	British nationals and dependents stopped from leaving Gaza with families - BBC News	Two British nationals and dependants of two others have been prevented from leaving Gaza with their families to flee the war between Hamas and Israel.Abdalrahman Alharazin, an interpreter from London, said his pregnant wife and three children were able to cross into Egypt at Rafah as their names were on an approved list of foreign nationals.His name was not, though, and he waited almost three days at the Egyptian side.Ahmed Sabra, a doctor from Swansea, is stuck in the same situation.    Like Mr Alharazin, he was separated from his wife and three children after officials on the Palestinian side of the border allowed him to accompany them to the Egyptian side.The two dependants, who have not been named, are the wives of British men who were allowed to cross into Egypt. One of the women is a doctor and the mother of two British children. "I am really in shock, because I was in safety for 72 hours," Mr Alharazin told the BBC on Wednesday. "I was expecting someone to help me and my kids, who are in tears, and my wife who needs a hospital. I thought someone would really look at us with mercy."The UK government said it would not comment on specific cases, but that it was working round the clock to help.More than 150 of the estimated 200 British nationals who were in Gaza when the war began have been allowed to cross into Egypt since the Rafah crossing was reopened for foreign passport holders and seriously injured Palestinians a week ago. Israel has been bombarding Gaza for a month and launched a major ground offensive over a week ago in response to an attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 10,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while the UN warns that a humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding.Mr Alharazin told the BBC that he had travelled to Gaza four months ago along with his wife and their three sons - Ibrahim, 10, Yousef, 7, and Mohammed, 6.They fled the Shejaiya area east of Gaza City on 13 October, after the Israeli military told the 1.1 million people in the north to flee southwards for their own safety. The family slept in a makeshift shelter at a UN-run school until 4 November, when the names of Mr Alharazin's wife and children appeared on a list of foreign passport holders who had been cleared to leave Gaza by Egyptian and Israeli authorities.They then moved to an area near the Egyptian border and waited until Monday, when crossings through Rafah resumed following a two-day suspension. Mr Alharazin said Palestinian officials allowed him to accompany his family to the arrivals hall on the Egyptian side of the crossing even though his name was not also on the approved list."The Palestinians told me: 'You should go with your wife and kids. And hopefully you will get across to Egypt.' "We managed to get inside. But in Egypt, obviously, they said: 'Your name is not on the list. You have to wait here until the embassy puts you on the list.'""So we waited for two-and-a-half days," he added. "And this morning they told us: 'Sorry, your embassy didn't do what it's supposed to do. And we are sending you back to Gaza.'"Mr Alharazin said he did not understand why the UK had allowed four families to be separated.Now, he has to find refuge again in what he described as "the most dangerous area on Earth right now". "I am very fearful of my life," he said. "This is an appeal to please get us out of here."Dr Sabra told the BBC that he and his family had arrived in Gaza to visit relatives only three days before the war began, and that they had spent three weeks waiting near Rafah.He was similarly refused permission to enter Egypt with his wife and three children after being allowed through the crossing by Palestinian officials. "[We] arrived on the Egyptian side and we just let out a big sigh of relief. We thought we [had] made it to safety, only to be told: 'No, your father has to go back.'"  He added: "We were waiting on the Egyptian side of the border for the British embassy [in Cairo] to do their job, but unfortunately this did not materialise."Dr Sabra said being forced to return to Gaza was like being given a "death sentence" and accused the UK of not doing enough to protect its citizens."Just because I am of Palestinian origin, I am not as equal as any other human. I didn't want to say this, but this is the reality. It is a disgrace," he complained.Dr Sabra and Mr Alharazin said their families had both finally found safety in Cairo. A spokesperson for the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it was "working round the clock to ensure all British nationals in Gaza who want to leave are able to". "This involves submitting all details of British nationals and eligible dependants to the Israeli and Egyptian authorities. The authorities then review all cases and give permissions to cross.""We remain in regular contact with British nationals in Gaza to provide them with the latest information, and UK teams are forward deployed to the border to receive anyone leaving."	
08/11/2023 16:33:00	Iran: French tourist Louis Arnaud jailed for five years - BBC News	A French tourist held in Iran for over a year on national security charges has been sentenced to five years in jail. Louis Arnaud, a banking consultant, was arrested in September 2022 - accused of participating in anti-government protests and of contributing to anti-government propaganda. He has been held at the notorious Evin prison in the capital, Tehran, ever since. The French government on Wednesday called for his immediate release. "This conviction, which has nothing to support it and the absence of any access to a lawyer, is unacceptable," said the country's foreign ministry in a statement. Mr Arnaud's family confirmed the sentence and said he was innocent of all charges - describing the guilty verdict as "an attack on human rights and individual freedoms", according to the AFP news agency.They said in a statement that he had actively stayed away from the protests that erupted across the country in September last year following the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody. "At no time did he act with political intentions or carelessness."His loved ones have stated in the past that he was celebrating the birthday of one of a group of backpackers he had met on his travels when they were stopped by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard. All of the others who were detained, including other foreigners, have since been released. Mr Arnaud's family added on Wednesday that he had appealed against the verdict. There's been no comment so far from the Iranian authorities. Western governments accuse Tehran of detaining foreigners and dual nationals on spurious grounds to be used as bargaining chips. Evin prison, where Mr Arnaud is being held, has long been criticised by rights groups. Human Rights Watch has accused authorities at the prison of using threats of torture and of indefinite imprisonment, as well as lengthy interrogations and denial of medical care for detainees. Iran's Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) estimates that around 20,000 people have been detained in the country in relation to the protests. 	
08/11/2023 16:23:00	US warns Israel against reoccupying Gaza after war - BBC News	US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned that Israel cannot reoccupy Gaza after the war with Hamas ends.Mr Blinken also insisted Hamas could not continue to rule there as it risked a repetition of the 7 October attacks.He said there should be no forced displacement, blockade or reduction of territory, and that the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority should govern.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will have "overall security responsibility" for Gaza indefinitely.He did not elaborate on what that would entail when he made the comment in an TV interview on Monday, but a senior Israeli official told reporters in Washington on Tuesday that Israel had no intention of reoccupying Gaza or controlling it for "a long time".Israel has been bombarding the territory for a month and began a major ground offensive over a week ago with the objective of destroying Hamas, which it, the US and other Western powers consider a terrorist organisation.The war began after an unprecedented cross-border assault on southern Israel by Hamas on 7 October, in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 10,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while the UN is warning that an "unfolding catastrophe" is making a humanitarian ceasefire more urgent.At a meeting in Tokyo, foreign ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) wealthy nations declared that they supported "humanitarian pauses and corridors to facilitate urgently needed assistance, civilian movement and the release of hostages". But they stopped short of calling for a ceasefire.At a news conference afterwards, Mr Blinken set out the Biden administration's position on what a post-conflict Gaza should look like."The United States believes key elements should include no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. Not now. Not after the war," he said. "No use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism or other violent attacks. No reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict ends. No attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza. No reduction in the territory of Gaza.""We must also ensure no terrorist threats can emanate from the West Bank."The secretary of state said "affirmative elements" were necessary for a "sustained peace"."It must include Palestinian-led governance and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority," he said."And it must include a sustained mechanism for reconstruction in Gaza, and a pathway to Israelis and Palestinians living side-by-side in states of their own, with equal measures of security, freedom, opportunity and dignity."When asked about the Israeli prime minister's comments, he said there would need to be a "transition period at the end of the conflict" but that he did not believe Israel intended to reoccupy and govern Gaza.Israel occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war. Although it withdrew its forces and settlers from Gaza in 2005, the UN still considers the territory occupied because Israel retains control over its air space, coastal waters and shared border.On Tuesday, Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer clarified to the BBC what Mr Netanyahu had meant by "security responsibility".  "Governance requires an administration we assume will be Palestinian," he said. "There's a question of the overriding security responsibility, that's what he was talking about, to ensure that in a post-Hamas Gaza we don't have the re-emergence of a terror threat from in Gaza."  "Israel wasn't operating or doing any operations in Gaza, and we saw what happened over nearly two decades," he added. "They built this terror state right on the south of Israel and we saw the effects of this."  He also doubted whether the Palestinian Authority - which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under full Israeli control and is dominated by the Fatah movement, Hamas's rival - was the right body to govern Gaza."They haven't shown their ability there to actively fight terrorism," he added.Mustafa Barghouti, head of the Palestinian National Initiative, was sceptical about what Mr Netanyahu was saying in public. "When he says that he wants to keep the security control of Gaza forever that means he's planning to annex Gaza to Israel," he told the BBC.Mr Barghouti said Palestinians needed a unified leadership that "could prepare the ground for free democratic elections and end the occupation, not only of Gaza Strip but also of the West Bank and East Jerusalem".On the ground on Wednesday, the UN said thousands more people had fled northern areas as Israeli troops battled Hamas fighters deep inside Gaza City.For a second day, crowds were seen walking southwards along Salah al-Din Road during a window announced by the Israeli military. Many said they had run out of food and water or were frightened by news of Israeli forces' advances, while UN monitors reported that some had to cross Israeli checkpoints, where they saw people arrested.Israel's military is focusing its operations on Gaza City, where it claims Hamas has its central command and a vast network of tunnels. Hundreds of thousands of people have now heeded Israeli orders to move to the south since the war began, although in recent days Israel has continued to strike what it says are Hamas targets there and civilians have been killed.	
08/11/2023 15:07:00	UK doctor sent back to Gaza after escape to Egypt is refused - BBC News	A doctor from Swansea has been forced back into Gaza after being refused permission to escape to Egypt. Ahmed Sabra's name was not on an approved list of foreign nationals allowed to leave the Gaza strip, forcing him to be separated from his wife and three children who did escape.Dr Sabra told the BBC he has been sent to a "death sentence" and accused the UK government of failing to help.The Foreign Office said it was in regular contact with British nationals. Dr Sabra and his family were visiting relatives when the war with Israel began, and had been waiting to leave Gaza for a month. He said staff on the Palestinian side of the border had allowed him to remain with his family while they made their journey towards Egypt.He and his family spent two days at the Rafah border waiting for his name to be processed, only to be told he did not have permission to enter Egypt.Dr Sabra is currently on the Palestinian side of the Rafah border while his family are in Cairo.He told the BBC he is happy that his family are safe, he has claimed the UK government has "not done enough" to help him and is pleading with them to help him escape. "I'm calling on the Foreign Office to do their duty for a British national. To evacuate me and get me out of Gaza," he said."We are now being sent to a death sentence. "We've been sent to the most dangerous place in world and I don't think the UK government did anything to help us."We've been told that there is a clear process to follow and the British Embassy did not follow the process."Dr Sabra described the last four weeks of the war as a "very distressing experience"."We're seeing death every day, we smell death, the sound of death and we felt like we died one hundred times," he said.Geraint Davies, independent MP for Swansea West, said Dr Sabra's failure to be allowed to leave Gaza was a "grotesque failure" by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office [FCDO] which had put him in "mortal danger"."Dr Sabra is my constituent, and a Swansea NHS consultant has been allowed by the UK government to be removed from Egyptian soil and returned to Gaza after getting across the Rafah border whilst his wife and three children have been sent without him to Cairo. "This is more than a grotesque failure by the FCDO who are directly complicit according to the Egyptians in him being sent back to mortal danger. "I have been in touch with No 10 which, alongside James Cleverly and Lord Ahmad who I am in touch with directly, must be held responsible for allowing this to happen. "Much more was done for non UK nationals escaping from enemies in Kabul than for Dr Sabra who was already in the British Embassy's care and has now been returned to face the risk of sudden death in Gaza."A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We're working round the clock to ensure all British nationals in Gaza who want to leave are able to. This involves submitting all details of British nationals and eligible dependants to the Israeli and Egyptian authorities. The authorities then review all cases and give permissions to cross. "We remain in regular contact with British nationals in Gaza to provide them with the latest information, and UK teams are forward deployed to the border to receive anyone leaving".Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October when Hamas attacks saw 1,400 people killed and more than 200 taken hostage.More than 10,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.	
08/11/2023 12:52:00	Hezbollah warns of regional war if Gaza bombing goes on - BBC News	The second in command of Hezbollah - the powerful Iranian backed militia in Lebanon - has said Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza risks wider war in the Middle East. Sheikh Naim Qassem told the BBC that "very serious and very dangerous developments could occur in the region, and no-one would be able to stop the repercussions".Hezbollah's deputy leader was speaking in an interview in Beirut, as the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 10,000 people had been killed there. Israel's assault follows the Hamas attacks on 7 October which killed 1,400 people - 1,000 of them civilians.  "The danger is real," he said, "because Israel is increasing its aggression against civilians and killing more women and children. Is it possible for this to continue and increase, without bringing real danger to the region? I think not."He insisted any escalation would be linked to Israel's actions. "Every possibility has a response," he said.Hezbollah, "the Party of God" has plenty of possibilities.The Shia Islamist group - classed as a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and the Arab League - is the largest political and military force in Lebanon.  So far its response to the war in Gaza has involved amplifying its warnings, but carefully calibrating its actions.  When an Israeli strike killed a woman and three children in southern Lebanon on Sunday, Hezbollah used Grad rockets for the first time in the conflict, killing an Israeli civilian.Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has threatened that every civilian death in Lebanon will reap another across the border. But notably, he has not threatened Israel with all-out warWhile insisting that "all options are on the table" the militant group has confined itself to cross-border attacks, hitting mainly military targets. More than 60 of its fighters have been killed, but it has plenty more battle-hardened supporters to replace them. One fighter buried in Beirut this week was the fifth member of his family to die for Hezbollah, going back generations.Throughout our interview the organisation's deputy leader tried to portray Hezbollah as a defensive organisation - though it is committed to Israel's destruction and sparked a war with Israel in 2006 by abducting two of its soldiers in a cross-border raid.Sheikh Qassem claimed Israel "initiated the aggression against Gaza in a hideous way". When the BBC pointed out that it was Hamas that had attacked Israel on 7 October, he defended the attacks as an inevitable response to Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands. He repeated the unfounded claim that Israeli forces, not Hamas, killed many Israeli civilians. But what of the helmet cameras - worn by the Hamas militants themselves - showing them on a killing spree? He parried the question. "Why don't we look at what Israel has done inside Gaza," he said. "They kill civilians and demolish homes."He called the Hamas attacks "a great result for the Palestinian resistance" and denied they had backfired. What about the 10,000 Gazans who have been killed since then? "The massacres committed by Israel are mobilising the Palestinians more and more to cling to their land," he replied.He conceded that Iran "supports and finances" Hezbollah but claimed it did not give the orders. But experts say it is Tehran that calls the shots and will decide whether or not to engage in all-out war.And if Israeli forces have to wage war on a second front with Hezbollah, they will be facing an enemy with more arms than most countries. The militant group puts Hamas in the shade, with an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles.It has up to 60,000 fighters, including special forces, regular fighters, and reserves, according to Nicholas Blanford, a Beirut-based defence and security consultant, who has studied Hezbollah for decades.Back in 2006 the group fought Israel to a standstill, but Lebanon had a lot more dead. More than 1,000 of its people were killed, most of them civilians, and whole neighbourhoods were flattened in Hezbollah strongholds. Israel lost 121 soldiers and 44 civilians.Lebanon has careened from crisis to crisis since then - with the devastating explosion in Beirut port in 2020, the collapse of the economy, and the disintegration of the political system. Small wonder few here have an appetite for war.Many worry that Hezbollah's cross-border attacks could drag this country into a war it cannot afford. Sheikh Qassem is unapologetic. "It's the right of any Lebanese to be afraid of war," he said. "That's normal. Nobody likes war. Tell the Israeli entity to stop the aggression, so the battles do not expand."There could be many shades of escalation ahead - short of all-out war between Hezbollah and Israel. But if it comes it will bring devastation all round, says Blanford."It's going to make what's happening in Gaza look like a walk in the park," he told the BBC. "Israel will be in lockdown for the duration of the conflict. Most of its population will have to remain in bomb shelters," he said. "There would be no civil aviation or maritime traffic. Hezbollah's larger guided missiles could hit military targets across the country."As for Lebanon, he said Israel would reduce it to "a car park".For now, Hezbollah, Israel, and Iran are all holding back, old enemies assessing new realities.That doesn't mean all-out war won't happen - by miscalculation if not by design.This is a dangerous new chapter in a blood-soaked region. After 7 October, the only certainties appear to be more anguish, death, and destruction.	
08/11/2023 10:19:00	Rashida Tlaib censured over Israel-Gaza comments - BBC News	The US Congress has voted to censure its only Palestinian-American member over comments she made on the Israel-Gaza war.Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib was rebuked for her defence of the chant "from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free".The resolution formally condemned her for "calling for the destruction of the state of Israel".The measure passed by 234 to 188 votes. Twenty-two Democrats voted to censure.Ms Tlaib posted a video to Twitter on Friday that included a clip of protestors using the chant, which critics say calls for Palestinian control of all land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, including Israel. The video also accused President Joe Biden of supporting genocide in Gaza and called for a ceasefire.The Anti-Defamation League and Jewish groups say the slogan, used at protests around the world, is a call for the destruction of Israel.Pro-Palestinian activists argue that most people using it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the elimination of Israel itself.Ms Tlaib later defended her use of the slogan, calling it "an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate." The comment stirred up cross-party condemnation and criticism from allies in her own state, prompting two separate measures seeking to censure her.Republican Representative Rich McCormick, who represents Georgia, introduced a resolution on Monday, accusing Ms Tlaib of "calling for the destruction of the state of Israel and dangerously promoting false narratives" about Hamas's attack on Israel.Twenty-two Democrats joined the vast majority of Republicans voting for Ms Tlaib's censure.After the vote, Ms Tlaib told the house that her comments were directed at the Israeli government."I can't believe I have to say this, but Palestinian people are not disposable. We are human beings, just like anyone else," she said.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed in the 7 October attack by Hamas. The Hamas-run health ministry says that more than 10,300 Palestinians have since been killed in Israeli attacks.The Biden administration has dismissed calls for a ceasefire in favour of a humanitarian pause to allow aid, food and water into Gaza.	
08/11/2023 06:42:00	Hamas hostages: Israeli mothers recall their children being kidnapped by Hamas - BBC News	Renana Jacob was not at home when Hamas's deadly attack on 7 October reached her kibbutz in southern Israel, but she quickly managed to reach her two sons by phone. "The boys told me that they heard gunshots outside, and I started reassuring them that it was the army coming to save them," she said of Yagel, 12, and Or, 16.It was not Israeli soldiers outside the home, however, but Hamas gunmen, who killed 1,400 people, mainly civilians, and took more than 200 people hostage in those attacks. A few hours into the attacks, Ms Jacob said Yagel whispered down the phone to her that people had broken into the house. "They were terrified," she said. "The last thing I heard my youngest boy saying to me a month ago… he was begging for them not to take him. He said 'I'm too young. Please don't take me. I'm too young'."But they took him."She has not heard from her two children since. Yagel and Or are believed to be among the 242 people the Israeli military said Hamas is holding hostage in the Gaza Strip. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is "gravely concerned" about their conditions - especially those who are children, elderly or in poor health - and has called for their immediate release. Ms Jacob was speaking to the BBC's The Context, in an emotional interview alongside two other Israeli mothers - Batsheva Yahalomi and Hadas Kalderon - whose children have also been kidnapped by Hamas. The trio travelled from Israel to the UK to raise awareness about the issue, conducting media interviews and meeting with the Qatari ambassador to the UK. The Gulf state is acting as a mediator between Israel and Hamas - proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK - to try and free the hostages. Ms Jacob said the ambassador has "given us the impression that Qatar is doing whatever they can to help, and I do believe him". Ms Yahalomi also underwent a terrifying ordeal when gunmen entered her family's home on 7 October. She managed to escape with her two daughters - including a baby - after Israeli soldiers intercepted their would-be kidnappers near the Gaza border.Her husband Ohad - who she said was shot by Hamas "terrorists" - and her 12-year-old son, Eitan, were taken into Gaza on motorbikes, and she has not heard from them since. "This was the last time I saw my son… [I've] not had any contact, any news from him," she said. Ms Kalderon had five members of her family - including her two children Erez, 12, and Sahar, 16, as well as their father, Ofer - taken hostage. Her elderly mother and niece were killed by Hamas. "I don't even have time to grieve. I didn't even go to the funeral because I have to fight for those that are still alive," she said, adding that the release of hostages must be the "main priority". "We know nothing about them. They've been held in tunnels, deep underground. They can't see the sky, and the sun, and I'm sure they're terrified," she said. Ms Jacob said 32 children are being held by Hamas, and called for their immediate release. Israel has been launching near-constant air strikes on the Gaza Strip since the 7 October attacks. The Hamas-run health ministry there says more than 10,300 people have been killed, including more than 4,100 children.Some politicians have questioned the accuracy of those figures, but the WHO says it believes them to be reliable.  Ms Jacob called for a "pause" to ensure that children in Gaza can also make it out safely. "There's so much violence going on. But my heart goes out to every child and every mother who becomes a victim of this." So let us just pause and have a children's time-out - get our children out and get the Gaza children out," she said. As well as international criticism for the bombing campaign his government is overseeing, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also faced anger at home, notably about the security failure that allowed Hamas to breach the border wall and kill thousands, as well as the lack of progress on freeing hostages. So far just five hostages are known to have been freed. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Mr Netanyahu, also appeared on The Context and acknowledged a "terrible failure" in the security response ahead of Hamas' attacks. He was also asked about an apparent lack of communication with the families of those held hostage and said a "special directorate" has been established. "We can only feel their pain and their suffering, and we're making a maximum effort to get out their loved ones," he said. For their part, Ms Jacob, Ms Yahalomi and Ms Kalderon are focusing their energy on ensuring their loved ones are released as soon as possible. "They disappeared from our life. We don't know when we're going to see them again," Ms Kalderon said. 	
08/11/2023 05:58:00	'I’m calling from Israeli intelligence. We have the order to bomb. You have two hours' - BBC News	The call to Mahmoud Shaheen came at dawn.It was Thursday 19 October at about 06:30, and Israel had been bombing Gaza for 12 days straight. He'd been in his third-floor, three-bedroom flat in al-Zahra, a middle-class area in the north of the Gaza Strip. Until now, it had been largely untouched by air strikes. He'd heard a rising clamour outside. People were screaming. "You need to escape," somebody in the street shouted, "because they will bomb the towers".As he left his building and crossed the road, looking for a safe place, his phone lit up.It was a call from a private number. "I'm speaking with you from Israeli intelligence," a man said down the line, according to Mahmoud. That call would last more than an hour - and it would be the most terrifying call of his life.The voice addressed Mahmoud by his full name and spoke in flawless Arabic. "He told me he wanted to bomb three towers… and ordered me to evacuate the surrounding area."Mahmoud's tower was not directly under threat - but he was suddenly responsible for evacuating hundreds of people. "I had the lives of people in my hands," he says. He gathered his thoughts and told the man, who identified himself as Abu Khaled, not to hang up the phone.As a 40-year-old dentist, Mahmoud says he has no idea why he was chosen for this task. But that day, he did everything he could to keep his community safe. Directed by the voices of strangers, who always seemed to know how to reach him even when his battery ran out, he pleaded for the bombing to stop and screamed until his throat hurt for people to run away. He led a mass evacuation of his neighbours - and then watched his neighbourhood explode in front of his eyes.During this conflict, the Israeli military has phoned Gazans sometimes to warn them ahead of air strikes - Mahmoud's account gives an insight into one such phone call in an unprecedented level of detail.The BBC contacted Mahmoud after multiple al-Zahra residents identified him as the man who received the warning call. We cannot independently verify the contents of the call, which he recounted roughly three weeks after the event. The details, however, match those on a community Facebook group from the day as well as satellite images before and after the bombing.We know that day many hundreds of people were left homeless as the Israeli army bombed at least 25 residential blocks housing hundreds of apartments, destroying an entire neighbourhood. These people were forced to flee with what few belongings they could take, and were eventually dispersed across Gaza. The IDF says it strikes military targets and these actions are subject to the "relevant provisions of international law". Mahmoud could not believe it when the man began speaking, he recalls.People around him warned that the call may be fake. Since the war had begun, messages had been circulating in the community Facebook group warning of hoax calls and offering tips on identifying real Israeli evacuation orders.Mahmoud asked the voice on the phone to fire a warning shot to prove this was real. If those still sleeping did not hear the screams from the streets then they would hear the shot, he thought.A warning shot seemingly from nowhere, but perhaps from a drone, hit one of the apartment blocks under threat, he says. "I asked him to 'shoot another warning shot before you bomb'," Mahmoud says. One more rang out.Now that Mahmoud knew it was real he tried to stall, asking the man to be patient. "I told him: 'Don't betray us and bomb while people are still evacuating.'"The man said he would give Mahmoud time - he said he did not want anyone to die, the dentist recalls.Mahmoud responded that he didn't want anyone to even be injured.He kept the call going as he rushed around the neighbourhood, urging people to evacuate. One neighbour remembers the dentist "just shouting", then others joined in. "I didn't want to know that there's someone I could have saved and I didn't," Mahmoud says.Hundreds of people poured into the streets that morning. Residents of this usually peaceful city were screaming and running, some of them wearing their pyjamas or prayer clothes.The area - just north of the Wadi Gaza river, a point that Israel has been ordering civilians to move south of since the early days of the war - was made up of modern blocks of flats as well as shops, cafes, universities, schools, and parks. It was in these parks that people began to gather.Mahmoud could not understand why his neighbourhood had become a target. "I tried my best to stop him. I asked, 'Why do you want to bomb?'"He said, 'There are some things that we see that you don't see.'"The man did not explain what he meant. "It is an order from people bigger than me and you, and we have an order to bomb," the voice added, according to Mahmoud.When the areas around the buildings were clear the man informed Mahmoud that the bombing would begin.Mahmoud panicked - what if they bombed the wrong building by mistake? "Wait a bit," the man told him, he says.An Israeli aircraft circled overhead. Mahmoud stared at the three towers that neighboured his own apartment block. Then one of them was bombed."This is the tower that we want, stay away," the man on the phone said as the building fell, according to Mahmoud.The two other blocks were then destroyed.Images taken in al-Zahra that morning show rubble in the place of those three apartment blocks, while a video shows residents wandering around in shock and bewilderment as they view the immediate aftermath of the strikes. A post on the community Facebook group at 08:28 local time says three towers had been "wiped out completely".When the bombing stopped, Mahmoud remembers the voice telling him: "We've finished… you can go back."Mahmoud didn't understand what he had just witnessed. He had lived in this Gaza neighbourhood for 15 years, running a busy dental practice and bringing up his children there."I told him al-Zahra is a civilian area. No one is a stranger here… I tried to make him understand. It is not a border area, we have not had previous clashes. It was always an area outside of trouble," he says.A post that morning on the community Facebook group urged neighbours to offer beds, food and water to those made homeless.People searched for shelter or places to flee to. Local authorities started clearing the debris from the roads, and putting out fires in the rubble.Those whose homes remained intact returned. Some people felt a sense of security."We went back [home], thinking they won't bomb again," one told us.Later that day, Mahmoud had just finished his Isha, or night-time prayers, at his flat when he saw a missed call from a private number on his phone. His heart sank. "Immediately I understood there would be an evacuation and bombing, but I didn't know what the target would be. I thought it might be my home, it might be the home next to me," he says.His phone soon rang again. A different man was on the line.The voice said they had realised Mahmoud was a "wise man" after the events of that morning, which is why they were calling him again.The man introduced himself as Daoud.Mahmoud was unnerved by the level of detail the man had about his life - by the familiar way the man addressed him and referred to his son's name.According to Mahmoud's account, this man then made some attempt to explain what was happening in Gaza."He started telling me: 'Did you see how they [Hamas] slaughtered those children with knives?'…"I told him that according to our Islamic religion, this is forbidden," Mahmoud recalls.He urged the voice against "mass punishment", but Mahmoud knew it was hopeless.Mahmoud says the man told him more buildings would be destroyed that night, and the dentist would need to order his neighbours to evacuate once again.At first, he was told the targets were two buildings next to the three that had been destroyed that morning, as well as a second block of towers."He said to me, 'We want you to inform people to evacuate the area,' and I said, 'You need to give me time.'"He got to work. "We evacuated all the people and even evacuated a third block because it was so close to the second one," Mahmoud says.At this point al-Zahra was largely in darkness. Residents say electricity had gone and they were using phones and torches for light as they filled the streets. Some had time to grab pre-packed bags as they left their homes, with items like spare clothing, water, phones and first aid kits. Others did not."It was absolute horror," one resident, Abdullah al-Khatib, says. "We didn't know where to go. We literally just ran out, taking nothing.""Can't see clearly. Just evacuate," another says by WhatsApp message, recalling the events of that night. "I just focus on being safe with family." Mahmoud continued trying to buy as much time as he could, talking to the man who called himself Daoud until everyone was clear of the area and had been able to get into their cars if they wanted to drive away.Three buildings were destroyed. As Mahmoud watched the destruction, the man on the phone said three more buildings would be bombed and then the residents would be allowed to return.But a change of orders came suddenly.They would bomb the full row of apartment blocks on the eastern side of the street, Mahmoud recalls being told.This was more than 20 tower blocks, and hundreds of homes."There were people we hadn't evacuated yet because there was no warning about those buildings. I told him, 'At least give us until morning, in night time, where will the people go?'"The answer was, 'The orders have been received, and we will bomb all towers within two hours.'"Mahmoud screamed at people to clear the area, running from block to block.Residents describe chaotic scenes of adults shouting and children weeping. Some parents and children lost one another in the melee.Despite the panic, Mahmoud stayed on the phone the whole time, trying his best to delay the bombing.The voice on the other end of the phone continued, without emotion."He even told me, 'Take your time. I won't bomb unless you give me permission.'"I said 'No, it's not my permission. I don't want you to bomb anything. If you want me to evacuate, I will evacuate for the safety of the people, but if you want to bomb, don't tell me you need my permission."'It's not Mahmoud Shaheen who will bomb al-Zahra.'"An elderly disabled woman lived in the last block of apartment buildings. Mahmoud and those around him told locals to "drive like crazy" to reach her and get her out.He and others also worried about a local elderly care home. But the man on the phone said "he'd just destroy the residential buildings", according to Mahmoud.Mahmoud says what he and his neighbours witnessed that night "wasn't a small bombing" but the "complete destruction of buildings", as the residential blocks were levelled one by one."It was a very hard night for all the people of al-Zahra."Photos and video footage posted by residents of the community show the aftermath of the evening bombing.A post on the Facebook group at 21:11 local time says: "Al-Zahra towers are being bombed right now. God have mercy."One resident speaking to the BBC via WhatsApp message recalled the confusion in the streets. "We didn't know where we should go - some said we must go to schools, some said we should go to Al Nuseirat [a refugee camp south of the neighbourhood]. During that [time] came cruel bombs."Mahmoud asked the man on the phone where he should take his neighbours."He said, 'Either take them east or west'. I said, 'To take them east will be hard, because to the east of al-Zahra is Al Mughraqa - an already unsafe area. People were already scared to go there.'"He told me, 'Take them west to Palestine Street'. I suggested the University of Palestine and he said yes."Mahmoud led the crowd, which included not just residents of the tower blocks, but also other displaced people who had sought shelter in al-Zahra after fleeing their own homes elsewhere in northern Gaza.Other residents have confirmed that they went to the university, and a video posted on the Facebook group shows people walking and driving in that direction, as the person behind the camera prays.Mahmoud says people waited at the university in fear, listening to the drumming of explosions outside. Frightened dogs in the street tried to find a spot to lie down between women and children.At one point, Mahmoud says the voice on the phone asked him how much battery he had left. He had 15%. They told him to hang up to preserve it and that they would call back again.Frequent calls followed."They would ring to tell me, 'Now we will bomb another building,' 'Now we will bomb another one.' They said, 'We will keep calling until we finish,'" Mahmoud says.At one point a neighbour's phone rang, with the voice asking for Mahmoud Shaheen.Mahmoud had been keeping his distance from his wife and five children all day - both because he was busy evacuating people and because he feared that his contact with Israeli intelligence made him a target.At the university, he checked they were OK, and then left them again.The residents of al-Zahra endured a sleepless night. The crowd looked to Mahmoud for updates and answers."[They were] saying 'Hey doctor, did they call you so we can go back? Did they tell you where they will hit?'"Dawn broke. A post on the community Facebook group at 08:53 local time said: "The bombing is still going on up to this moment."Videos shared overnight captured flashes of orange in the night sky. Others shot in the morning show plumes of grey smoke rising with the sun over the city. Mahmoud and the man who called himself Daoud kept speaking until the streets went quiet. Then the calls abruptly stopped without any further instructions for the people of al-Zahra."They didn't tell us to go back to our homes, or to evacuate or leave the area. So people waited until noon, and then they started to move," Mahmoud says.In the hours and days that followed, the community of al-Zahra, like many in Gaza, disbanded."Even for the people whose homes were still standing, there are no services left… the sewage systems are damaged, there is no bakery, there is no supermarket, there is no water, no electricity," Mahmoud says.Mahmoud's block was not destroyed, although it was severely damaged. The neighbourhood where he built up his dental practice over 15 years, and became a linchpin of the community, is now gone. There is nothing left for him in al-Zahra.He has taken his family to another region of Gaza, where he is staying in a friend's house that is crowded with people."I don't think about my clinic or my house, I just pray that I survive and stay alive," he says."Material things are nothing, you could die at any second right now. We don't think about anything else."Israel is known to have warned Gazans by calling them, texting them and dropping leaflets before bombing. But in some cases, civilians say they have not been warned ahead of time.The IDF told the BBC that as part of its "mission to dismantle the Hamas terrorist organisation [it] has been targeting military targets across the Gaza Strip". Strikes on military targets were subject, it said, to "relevant provisions of international law, including the taking of feasible precautions to mitigate civilian casualties". "Hamas continues to attack Israel from across the entire Gaza Strip. Hamas has embedded itself in civilian infrastructure and operates across the entire Gaza Strip. The IDF is determined to end these attacks and as such we will strike Hamas wherever necessary."The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 10,000 people have been killed by Israel since the war began - more than a third of them are children. Israel's retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza followed Hamas gunmen rampaging into Israel on 7 October, killing 1,400 people, including many women and children, and taking hundreds of others hostage.Thanks to Mahmoud's efforts, it is believed that none of his neighbours died that day. But his account reveals the panic and anguish of a Palestinian community as they watched their homes and everything they love blow up around them.The BBC has spoken to multiple families who lived in al-Zahra, a neighbourhood of professionals and entrepreneurs, in which families ate falafel and pizza on the beach together, and children played football in the dawn light as the call to prayer sounded across the rooftops.In the second part of this story, we will bring you into the lives of the people who called this place home - of a prosperous and vibrant community that was eradicated overnight.Additional reporting: Muath Al Khatib and BBC News Arabic's Dima Al BabilieVisual Journalism: Mike HillsVideo verification: Shayan SardarizadehEdited by Samuel Horti	
07/11/2023 22:26:00	Israel says troops operating 'in the heart of Gaza City' - BBC News	Israeli troops are operating "in the heart of Gaza City", Defence Minister Yoav Gallant says, as the country's military operation to destroy Hamas continues.He said troops on foot were being supported by armoured vehicles, tanks and military engineers.For its part Hamas said it was inflicting losses on Israeli forces and had destroyed military vehicles.The BBC cannot verify battle claims made by either side.Mr Gallant said troops were destroying Hamas infrastructure and Yahya Sinwar - the commander Israel says planned the group's devastating 7 October attack, killing 1,400 people - was isolated in his bunker.Israel's ground operation has been accompanied by devastating air strikes, which have killed more than 10,000 people, including thousands of children, according to the Hamas-run health agency in Gaza.On Tuesday air strikes killed at least 23 people in the southern towns of Rafah and Khan Younis, Hamas-run health ministry officials said. Israel has told Gazans to go to southern Gaza for their own safety.World Health Organization spokesman Christian Lindmeier said the "level of death and suffering" in the conflict was "hard to fathom" and an average of 160 children in Gaza were being killed every day.Israeli leaders are making increasingly bold claims about their operation in Gaza - but their forces are clearly now well established in some of the most built-up areas of the city.The army has released video of Israeli armoured vehicles operating along the coast road well to the south of the city centre, underlining that Israel now has the entire area encircled. But none of this means that Gaza City is on the verge of collapse.It is seen as Hamas's biggest stronghold, full of tunnels and bunkers. Israel says some of these are under major hospitals, including the city's largest, al-Shifa.The Israeli advance into Gaza City has also triggered a fresh exodus of civilians, heeding Israeli warnings to leave their homes and head south.For several hours on Tuesday, hundreds of people were on the move. Some on carts pulled by donkeys. Most on foot."It was so scary," Ola al-Ghul told AFP news agency. "We held our hands up and we kept walking. There were so many of us, we were holding white flags."Holding a walking stick, Hatem Abu Riash described how he had to walk past heavily-armed Israeli troops after fleeing Jabalia refugee camp, north of Gaza City."Next to the soldiers, next to the guns, next to the tanks, the aeroplane... it was really horrible," he said."We are not terrorists - we are civilians - we want to live in peace," he added.But the BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern town of Khan Younis, says half a million people are believed to be still living in northern Gaza.One man in northern Gaza, Hamdi al-Hato, said he and his family could not leave because the road out was destroyed and he personally could not walk 5km because he had a weak heart."We are a family of nine people. I used to sell coffee and earn 20 shekels ($5; £4) a day. Today, I have no money left and we have no food, water, or anything. My children are starving," he told the BBC.Most large bakeries in northern Gaza are closed due to lack of flour and fuel. Following the air strikes on southern Gaza footage showed one man emerging from the smouldering ruins of his home in Khan Younis.  "They show their might and power against civilians," he said. "Babies inside, kids inside."  A rescuer appeared to carry a dead baby out of the rubble, while a young girl waist-deep in rubble was slowly helped out.A neighbour, Abu Jihad, watched the scene. "People have been destroyed, their lives are destroyed," he said. "Thank God we are safe but I swear we are waiting for death each moment… it's a suspended death."Later on Tuesday, Palestinian media reported that at least two residential buildings were destroyed in air strikes in the central town of Deir al-Balah.The number of casualties was not clear, but footage showed people carrying at least four bodies from the remains of a house where two families had reportedly been staying. The official Wafa news agency cited witnesses as saying that dozens of people were killed or wounded in the strikes.Meanwhile the Hamas military wing said it was continuing to fire rockets at Israeli cities and towns. A BBC team in Tel Aviv reported loud explosions in the sky above the city as Israel's Iron Dome air defence system intercepted the rockets.	
07/11/2023 20:21:00	Couple died in Egypt after hotel fumigated for bedbugs, inquest hears - BBC News	A British couple who died in Egypt were staying at a hotel being fumigated to kill bedbugs, their inquest heard.John Cooper, 69, and his wife Susan, 63, of Burnley, Lancashire, died in 2018 while on holiday in Hurghada with their daughter and three grandchildren.The inquest heard the Coopers fell ill at the Aqua Magic Hotel during the early hours and died the next day.The inquest heard a report pointed to possible exposure to an "infectious biological agent or toxic chemicals".Blackburn Coroner's Court heard the report suggested neither carbon monoxide poisoning nor food poisoning caused the couple's deaths.A tourist from Germany said he reported a bedbug infestation in the room next door to the Coopers and it was then treated with pesticide, referred to as Lambda.The two rooms had an adjoining door but this was kept locked.Their daughter, Kelly Ormerod, described her parents as fit and healthy and had been enjoying a "brilliant" holiday.Mr Cooper, a builder, and his wife, Susan, a cashier at a bureau de change in a Thomas Cook travel agent, enjoyed several holidays a year.Mrs Cooper had been to the same hotel in April that year, described it as "fabulous" and decided to go back with her family.Their 12-year-old daughter Molly had been staying on a single bed in her grandparents' room, which she said had a "yeasty smell". In the early hours of 21 August, Mr Cooper rang to say she was feeling a little unwell and he escorted his granddaughter to her mother's room in an upper floor.The next morning, the couple failed to emerge for breakfast, so Ms Ormerod went to their ground floor room to discover the pair seriously ill.Ms Ormerod said her father came to the door saying: "I really don't feel very well," with him retching and screwing his face up."He just literally slumped and sat on the corner of the bed and said: 'I'm really not well," the civil servant told the hearing.She said her mother was in bed, "groaning", with vomit in her hair and around the room, where she noticed a strange "heavy" smell.Two doctors were summoned but they were in "panic mode", Ms Ormerod said, as her parents further deteriorated and her father struggled to breathe.Tearfully, Ms Ormerod added: "His eyes kind of... a glazed, staring look."CPR was attempted but Mr Cooper was declared dead in the hotel room. His wife was taken to a clinic at the hotel where she became delirious, the inquest heard.She was taken to hospital by ambulance but later declared dead.Both were returned to the UK in sealed, zinc-lined coffins, the inquest heard.A statement was read from Dominik Bibi, a truck despatcher from Germany, who arrived with seven family members in the early hours of 20 August.Mr Bibi said his mother-in-law, who used a wheelchair, was booked to stay in the ground-floor room next to the Cooper's room.His statement added: "On entering I immediately noticed a funny smell, like that of mould or damp."There was a lot of bed bugs in the bed and under it."He said a cleaner and night manager came and apologised and his mother-in-law took his and his wife's room, further down the corridor.Hours later around lunchtime he was outside her room when he saw three men, two wearing the hotel uniform and the other with a two or three litre pesticide canister he assumed being used to get rid of the bed bugs.After five or 10 minutes they left the room and used masking tape to tape up around the door and seal the room."I would not say the job was very professional," Mr Bibi's statement continued.The hearing was adjourned until Wednesday morning.Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

07/11/2023 19:51:00	Canadian man chooses to stay in Gaza to document the war - BBC News	A Palestinian-Canadian father has decided to stay behind in Gaza, despite finally being allowed to leave the embattled enclave.Mansour Shouman told the BBC that he feels a responsibility to remain and document the events around him.He said his five children and wife are among the first Canadians who managed to cross safely into Egypt on Tuesday.Of the 80 Canadians approved to leave Gaza so far, about 75 have gotten out safely.Global Affairs Canada has said that they are aware of more than 400 Canadian citizens, permanent residents and their family members who want to leave through the Rafah crossing into Egypt. Mr Shouman, a management consultant, said that for him staying behind is an obligation. "As long as 2.3 million people are suffering, I believe that it is my religious obligation, my humanitarian obligation to stay and tell the story about what is really happening," he said. "I can speak English, I've lived in the West," said Mr Shouman, who has already spoken to several international news outlets, including the BBCMr Shouman is an alum of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario and the University of Calgary in Alberta, and has worked for several years in Alberta's oil and gas sector.Originally from Jerusalem, Mr Shouman said that he and his family chose to move to the occupied Palestinian territories two years ago so that his children could grow up in their ancestral homeland.They chose to live in Gaza, he said, as it is his wife's hometown. "We had been living a very nice life here," Mr Shouman said, despite the long-standing turmoil in the Gaza strip. "Our kids were going to international school," he said. "My wife and I were working. We had a lot of friends. The local mosque was great."But he added he and his family never expected to be in the middle of the current war. Now, Mr Shouman has made a hospital in Khan Younis his home, where he sleeps in a small room next to the maternity ward. "Whenever a new baby is born, I hear the good news," he said.The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened on Wednesday to allow a number of civilians to leave. Hundreds of foreign passport holders, including more than 400 Americans, have crossed so far. It was their first opportunity to do so since the war began on 7 October.The lists of those allowed to cross is agreed upon by Egypt and Israel. Then, the relevant countries are notified to ensure they are ready to receive their citizens.Canada's foreign ministry has said the "situation is quite fluid and unpredictable" and that people should be prepared "for significant delays".Just before 01:00 local time on Tuesday, Mr Shouman said his family received an email from Canada's foreign affairs ministry, telling them that they were on the list of those approved to evacuate out of Gaza.They were told to head to the border at 09:00, where they would be met by Canadian consular staff on the Egyptian side. There, they would stay for 72 hours to rest before traveling back to Canada.Mr Shouman said that as a husband and father, he had an urge to remain with his family. But "the decision to stay behind was easy," he added.He said it is important for him to help in any way, "even if I am just removing rubble from the ground, even if I am just covering the news". Mr Shouman's family are among the first Canadians who have managed to leave, but hundreds of others are still stuck among bombed-out buildings, with dwindling supplies.The 73-year-old father of Samah Al-Sabbagh went to Gaza at the end of September to visit his family.She is frustrated that his name is not on the list of people able to leave."Every time I talk to my dad, I feel the despair in his voice," she said. "He says to me 'every extra day we spend in Gaza is leading us to death.'"Over the last month the Israeli military has launched a massive bombing campaign on Gaza, placed the strip under a "complete siege" and recently launched a ground assault on the north of Gaza. Ms Al-Sabbagh told the BBC that her father has witnessed the ongoing bombardment up close and has had to relocate four times for his safety. Some members of their family have also been killed, she said.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 10,300 people have been killed, including more than 4,000 children. Ms Al-Sabbagh wants Canadian officials to do whatever they can, including calling for a pause in fighting, so their citizens can safely evacuate. "There is not a single safe place in Gaza," she said.  In a statement on social media confirming the first group of Canadians had been evacuated, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly said her department is still working on getting the rest out. "You can rest assured that this is our number one priority," she said. 	
07/11/2023 19:23:00	Gaza journalist killed alongside 42 relatives, news agency says - BBC News	A Palestinian reporter has been killed alongside 42 family members, his news agency says, as a watchdog said the past month had been the most deadly for journalists since its records began.The Wafa news agency said Mohammad Abu Hasira was killed in an Israeli air strike on Gaza City.At least 37 journalists had been killed since the war began, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said.These include 32 Palestinians, four Israelis and one Lebanese.The CPJ said it was unclear whether all had been covering the conflict at the time of their deaths but said it was including them in its count while it investigated the circumstances.The group began documenting journalist fatalities in 1992.Last month Israel told international news organisations Reuters and AFP that it could not guarantee the safety of their journalists operating in the Gaza Strip.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was targeting Hamas throughout Gaza and accused the group of placing military operations "in the vicinity of journalists and civilians".Israeli air strikes could additionally damage nearby buildings, the IDF said.On Saturday AFP called on Israel to investigate an air strike that severely damaged its office located on the top floors of an 11-storey building."A strike on the offices of an international news agency sends a deeply troubling message to all the journalists working in such difficult conditions in Gaza," said AFP boss Fabrice Fries.Last week, Mohammad Abu Hatab, a correspondent for the Palestine TV news channel was killed in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip in an Israeli airstrike, along with 11 members of his family. His colleague Salman Al-Bashir broke down in tears on air when learning of his death, removing his vest and helmet saying that the even the protective gear was not keeping journalists alive.  Two Israeli photographers, Roee Idan and Yaniv Zohar, and members of their families were killed when Hamas attacked kibbutzes Kfar Aza and Nahal Oz on 7 October. Two Israeli reporters, Shai Regev and Ayelet Arnin, were killed during the Hamas attack on the Supernova music festival onthe same day, Israeli media reported.In Lebanon, prominent Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah was killed when covering Israeli rockets fired over the Israel-Lebanon border on 13 October. He was part of a group of journalists near the border town of Alma al-Shaab in southern Lebanon when he was hit by a rocket. Six other journalists were also injured in the strike. Shortly before Abdallah was killed, he posted on Instagram a picture of himself wearing a helmet and a flak jacket with the word "press" written on it.Six other journalists, including from Reuters, Al Jazeera and Agency France-Presse, were wounded. One of them, Reuters video journalist Maher Nazeh, said the teams "were filming missile fire coming from the direction of Israel when one struck Abdallah as he was sitting on a low stone wall near the rest of the group", according to a report published by the news agency.IDF spokesman Richard Hecht said the army was "deeply regretful for the incident" and was "actively investigating it" without saying that Israeli military was behind it.More than 10,300 people have been killed during Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel's retaliatory strikes began in response to Hamas' brutal 7 October attack, when the group killed 1,400 people and took more than 230 hostages.	
07/11/2023 17:01:00	Canadian poet Rupi Kaur declines White House visit over Gaza - BBC News	Canadian poet Rupi Kaur has declined an invitation to a Diwali celebration at the White House in protest against the Biden administration's response to the Israel-Hamas war.In a post on social media, Ms Kaur said she refuses "any invitation from an institution that supports the collective punishment" of civilians. She also called on other South Asians to hold the US government accountable. The Diwali event is due to take place on 8 November. It will be hosted by Vice-President Kamala Harris, who has yet to comment on the remarks. Ms Kaur, the India-born poet behind the critically-acclaimed book Milk and Honey, said she is "surprised this administration finds it acceptable to celebrate Diwali" - the Hindu festival of lights - as it is "a celebration of righteousness over falsehood and knowledge over ignorance". She accused the US government of justifying "genocide against Palestinians".The war began on 7 October after Hamas attacked Israel, resulting in more than 1,400 people being killed, according to Israeli authorities. Some 240 others are being held hostage in Gaza.Meanwhile, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said that more than 10,300 Palestinians have been killed since Israel's retaliatory attacks on the enclave, including more than 4,100 children.An Israeli siege on the enclave has also severely restricted access to food, water and fuel for the 2.2 million people living in Gaza. Ms Kaur also criticised President Joe Biden's refusal to support a humanitarian ceasefire, which is backed by the UN."As a Sikh woman, I will not allow my likeness to be used in whitewashing this administration's actions," Ms Kaur said.Mr Biden has instead advocated for a humanitarian "pause" in the fighting, as have Canada and the EU. The president reiterated his support for Israel on a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, according to a White House readout.Mr Biden also emphasised "the imperative to protect Palestinian civilians and reduce civilian harm in the course of military operations", it said. The administration has called on Congress to provide more than $14bn (£11.4bn) in aid to Israel, and has previously announced $100m in aid to Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. 	
07/11/2023 15:10:00	Could an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims? - BBC News	Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was."We have set two goals for the war: to eliminate Hamas by destroying its military and governing capabilities and to do everything possible to bring our hostages at home," announced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as Israel expanded its ground operations in Gaza.Operation Swords of Iron began in response to the killing of more than 1,400 people by Hamas gunmen in a brutal attack on Israeli communities, and Israel's chief of staff has said the military are fighting "for our right and the right of future generations to live in safety".That goal of ending Hamas rule has been endorsed by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in October that the final phase of Israel's Gaza plan was for a "new security regime" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.  Mr Netanyahu has since said "Israel will, for an indefinite period have the overall security responsibility", to prevent further Hamas attacks.Israel's aims appear far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before. But are they realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them?Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say 10,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 240 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza."I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam," says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. "But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities."Weakening it so it no longer poses a military threat to Israelis might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world.Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. In Antony Blinken's words, Hamas's "perverted idea" has to be combated with a "better idea" and a vision that gives people something to hope for.The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it.Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, has the use of an extensive network of tunnels and it has targeted Israeli forces with snipers and fighters armed with anti-tank missiles. The civilian death toll has soared since ground operations expanded on 27 October, and the IDF has lost increasing numbers of soldiers in combat.Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe."The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders," says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists.But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in."It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two," says Michael Milstein.Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release.Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders, and Hamas's political leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, has said they are ready to swap all the hostages for the thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.That kind of deal is unlikely. In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. Yahya Sinwar was among those freed, and is now their top man in Gaza.What could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react.Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point for supplies getting into Gaza. Hundreds of foreign passport holders and some of the wounded have been allowed to leave but more remain."The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians," says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies.But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has said Egypt rejects any attempt to move Gazans forcibly into the Sinai peninsula, adding that it would prompt Egyptians to "go out and protest in their millions".An internal Israeli intelligence ministry policy paper has raised the prospect of the Gaza population being expelled from the territory, but only a handful of far-right politicians have shown interest in the idea.Jordan's King Abdullah has talked of a "red line" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: "No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt," he warned.Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been regular, deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, and communities on both sides have been evacuated.Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has said "all options are open", but for the moment there is no indication of a broader axis against Israel opening up from the north. Hezbollah's main sponsor, Iran, has threatened "new fronts" against Israel, and Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have fired missiles and drones towards Israel too. But US President Joe Biden has issued a stern warning to Iran and its allies: "To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!"Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and some 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events.If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and government officials have said repeatedly they have "no desire to occupy or reoccupy Gaza". US President Joe Biden has said any move to occupy it again "would be a big mistake".A month into the war, Benjamin Netanyahu said once the war was over, it would be governed by "those who don't want to continue the way of Hamas", and that Israel would "for an indefinite period" have overall security responsibility. While not the same as re-occupation, it implies Israel would demand a substantial role.Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. Antony Blinken has said it would make "most sense... for an effective and revitalised" PA to run Gaza, although a number of other countries in the region could take part in "temporary arrangements" that might involve international agencies.What is clear is that a power vacuum would lead to even more problems.The United Nations could theoretically fill the gap in running Gaza temporarily, as it did in Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999. But that kind of solution would not go down well in Israel, where the UN is widely mistrusted.Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Michael Milstein.Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a "demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now".Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars.Israel will want even tighter restrictions on "dual-use goods" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities. 	
07/11/2023 14:56:00	South African divisions exposed by Israel-Hamas conflict - BBC News	The war between Israel and Hamas has exposed deep divisions in South Africa, with the government's staunch support for the Palestinians coming in for criticism from leaders of the country's Jewish community, among others.The government has announced the withdrawal of its diplomats from Israel, and suggested that the position of Israel's ambassador to Pretoria was becoming "untenable".This has been sharply criticised by the country's Jewish Board of Deputies which has called for an urgent meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa.South African sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back to the days of late anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela.He famously said in 1997, three years after he became the country's first democratically elected president after decades of struggle against white-minority rule: "We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians."The unprecedented Hamas attack on Israel, which killed some 1,400 people, has not changed the position of the country's ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC), even though two South African nationals were among the dead and another is among the more than 230 people taken hostage.President Ramaphosa has pledged the ANC's solidarity with the Palestinians, saying their history had echoes of apartheid - and South Africa's struggle against white-minority rule. Although he did condemn the Hamas assault, a week later he led 60 party leaders as they waved Palestinian flags, while wearing the traditional chequered black and white Palestinian scarf, the keffiyeh."They are people who have been under occupation for almost 75 years," he said of the Palestinians. "They have been waiting and waging a war against a government that has been dubbed an apartheid state."We have always pledged our solidarity, and have always insisted that the only solution, especially with the issues of Palestine, is a two-state solution." South Africa's foreign ministry has gone even further, suggesting that the Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 10,000 people, might amount to a genocide.In the statement announcing the withdrawal of its diplomats, Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor accused the Israelis of imposing "collective punishment" on Palestinian civilians - an allegation rejected by Israel.The government has not commented on the South African hostage, or named them.Its pro-Palestinian position has been condemned by the country's Jewish Board of Deputies, the South African Zionist Federation and the largest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA). Because of the passionate views on both sides, some South African talk radio stations have deliberately limited airtime around taking calls from listeners keen to discuss the war between Israel and Hamas.Large pro-Palestinian protest marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began.Smaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Last Friday members of the Jewish community hung up 221 big red balloons across Johannesburg's Nelson Mandela Bridge to bring attention to the Israeli hostages and call for their release.  One ANC official, Gabriella Farber, resigned from the party, accusing it of "supporting Hamas"."It has been made very clear to me that there is no space for a proud Jew to belong to the ANC no matter how hard I tried," she said in her resignation letter posted on X, formerly Twitter."It took the ANC nine days until they condemned Hamas for the atrocities they committed against the Jewish people. When the ANC condemned Hamas in the very next sentence they stated that Israel is committing a genocide," she said as she stepped down as spokesperson for the ANC Women's League in the Gauteng region.The government's stance has also drawn stinging criticism from Warren Goldstein, chief rabbi of The Union of Orthodox Synagogues of South Africa."I want to tell the president and I want to tell the ANC, you are not South Africa," he told an SA Zionist Federation rally for Israel. "This president, his party and this government is supporting an evil savagery that has shocked the hearts of all decent human beings in the world. How dare they?"But South Africa's Jewish community, believed to number around 65,000, is not united in its condemnation of the government's support for the Palestinians.Award-winning cartoonist Jonathan Shapiro, who identifies as a "secular Jew", says it is important to remember that many senior ANC figures during the fight against apartheid were Jewish and they did not support Israel."I think Farber must be very blind to the fact that most significant Jewish heroes of the anti-apartheid struggle were to a great extent very much against the Israel colonial project," Shapiro, better known by his pen name Zapiro, told the BBC.He pointed to top ANC officials such as Joe Slovo, Arthur Goldreich, Rusty Bernstein, Ronnie Kasrils and Amy Thornton, saying they had a "background as socialists or communists or, in general, people who want to see justice in struggles wherever they are fought".He said that Ms Farber could not pretend that "the ANC was somehow neutral on the issue of Palestine".During the struggle against white-minority rule, the ANC developed close ties with erstwhile leaders such as Cuba's Fidel Castro, Libya's Muammar Gaddafi as well as Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO). They all helped with material or moral support and saw one another as fellow liberation movements.Arafat was one of the first leaders Mandela met after being released from prison on 11 February 1990. The late PLO leader was among a group of leaders from South Africa's neighbours who had helped in the fight against apartheid who met Mandela in Zambia just two weeks after his release from 27 years in prison.  Although Mandela never set any conditions for the meeting, Arafat had already moved to accept Israel's right to exist and a few years later he signed the Oslo Accords. Under these, the PLO recognised Israel's right to exist and renounced terrorism in exchange for moves towards Palestinian self-rule for the West Bank and Gaza Strip.Foreign Minister Pandor has come under particular fire for having a telephone conversation with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh just a few days after the 7 October attack. Ms Pandor shrugged off the criticism, telling national broadcaster SABC that the ANC's experience of fighting the apartheid government was that the only way of finding a solution to a conflict was by talking to your enemies."South Africa is always dedicated to finding solutions and to promoting peace. When the Hamas leadership asked to speak to me, I agreed and I conveyed the wish of South Africa that there be peace. This is my responsibility to do. "When the apartheid state wanted to speak to our leaders we didn't say: 'They've been harming us, they've imprisoned our fathers and grandfathers.' We said: 'Let's talk.' This is the South African character," she said.Mr Ramaphosa, who played a prominent role in securing a negotiated settlement in Northern Ireland, says South Africa is ready to help mediate in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, drawing on its experience of conflict resolution.However, South Africa's Jewish Board of Deputies points out that if it were to expel Israel's ambassador that would "be a decision contrary to everything that the government claims it stands for, that is talking to both sides of the conflict".	
07/11/2023 13:36:00	Israeli archaeologists help find remains of Hamas attack victims - BBC News	Archaeologists have been enlisted to help Israel's military identify the remains of some of the 1,400 people killed in Hamas's attack a month ago.They have been combing through and sieving the ash from burnt houses in which families from Kibbutz Be'eri, Kfar Aza and Nir Oz were murdered, the Israel Antiquities Authority says.They have also been checking burnt cars at a festival site where hundreds died.The IAA says the remains of at least 10 missing people have so far been found.Some of them have since been buried, while other evidence has been brought for further examination at the Shura military base in central Israel. On 7 October, an estimated 1,500 Hamas gunmen breached the Gaza perimeter fence under a barrage of rockets and then systematically attacked anyone they came across at nearby southern Israeli communities and military posts, as well as the outdoor Supernova music festival.The UN says the names of 1,159 Israelis and foreign nationals who were killed, including 828 civilians, have so far been released by Israeli authorities. Of those whose ages have been provided, 31 were children. Another 242 people, including about 30 children, were taken hostage.The Israel Antiquities Authority said in a statement on Tuesday that its archaeologists had been asked by Colonel Yossi Cohen of the Israeli military's Gaza Division two weeks ago to help search for missing people in houses and cars that were incinerated in the attack."The archaeological methods employed at ancient sites are similar to the methods applied here," it cited the archaeologists as saying."But it is one thing to expose 2,000-year-old destruction remains, and quite another thing - heart-rending and unfathomable - to carry out the present task searching for evidence of our sisters and brothers in the settlements."A video posted online by the IAA showed a team of archaeologists and soldiers inside several destroyed houses in Kibbutz Be'eri.They are seen carefully inspecting ash and other charred debris on the floor with trowels and removing personal items from a sieve. "I believe and hope that we found the missing father," one of archaeologists is heard saying. "In the same house, we found several bodies of terrorists together with their weapons," he adds. "There was a lot of blood, shocking things that shouldn't be described here."Another archaeologist vows: "We will continue until we get to the last burnt house and we know that we have found everyone we possibly can." 	
07/11/2023 13:31:00	Netanyahu says Israel will have security control over Gaza after war - BBC News	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will have "overall security responsibility" for the Gaza Strip "for an indefinite period". Mr Netanyahu's first comments on Israel's plan for Gaza after the war came in an interview with the ABC News network in the US.However, he did not elaborate on the kind of security mechanism such a plan would involve.Israel says it aims to destroy Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked Israeli communities and a music festival on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people, Israeli authorities say, in the bloodiest such event in Israel's history. Hamas - proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and many Western governments, including the UK - also took 242 people hostage, the Israeli military says. Israel declared war on Hamas the same day and has been attacking Gaza from land, sea and air since then.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more more than 10,000 people have been killed since Israel began its operation.When asked who should govern Gaza - home to 2.2 million Palestinians - after the war, Mr Netanyahu said only "those who don't want to continue the way of Hamas".But he also declared that Israel must have security control."I think Israel will, for an indefinite period, have the overall security responsibility, because we have seen what happens when we don't have it. "When we don't have that security responsibility, we have the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn't imagine." Before the war, Israel - along with Egypt, which also shares a border with Gaza - blockaded the territory to try to stop weapons reaching the militant Islamist group and prevent it from carrying out attacks. Israel also controlled its border with Gaza, as well as Gaza's air space and shoreline, implementing a strict security regime and allowing in only certain vetted goods, as well as food, fuel and medicine. Imports were often halted after attacks from the territory.Despite Israel's controls, Hamas and other armed groups have frequently carried out attacks against it, with Israel repeatedly hitting Gaza with air strikes in response.Although it is unclear what type of security control Mr Netanyahu envisages, any return to long-term occupation on the ground is likely to be opposed by the international community.One week after the war began, US President Joe Biden said a re-occupation by Israel of Gaza would be "a big mistake".Although Israel pulled its troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005, the UN considers the territory as remaining under Israeli occupation.	
07/11/2023 08:54:00	Rashida Tlaib's claims of genocide in Gaza draw bipartisan criticism - BBC News	House Republicans have introduced two separate measures to censure a Democrat amid cross-party criticism of her comments on the Israel-Gaza war.Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American member of Congress, had posted a video accusing President Joe Biden of supporting genocide in Gaza.The White House and several Democrats criticised that and other remarks.Ms Tlaib said her colleagues were "more focused on silencing me than they are on saving lives".In a video posted to social media on Friday, Ms Tlaib directly addressed President Biden and called for a ceasefire.It features clips of Mr Biden stating his support for Israel, followed by clips of the dead and injured in Gaza and pro-Palestinian protests across the US."Joe Biden supported the genocide of the Palestinian people," titles at the end of the video read. "The American people won't forget."The video also features people chanting the slogan "from the river to the sea", which some use to call for Palestinian control of all land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, including Israel.Jewish groups like the Anti-Defamation League say the slogan is a call for the destruction of the state of Israel.That interpretation is disputed by pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.Representing a Michigan district that includes parts of Detroit and Dearborn, Ms Tlaib is one of just three Muslim lawmakers in Congress. She has long angered party leaders and pro-Israel groups with her unflinching criticism of Israel.Defending her latest remarks, she said the slogan is "an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate".But the comment has drawn criticism from all corners, including from Democratic allies in her own state.In a tweet to Ms Tlaib, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called the use of the phrase "hurtful"."I have supported and defended you countless times, even when you have said the indefensible, because I believed you to be a good person. Please retract this cruel and hateful remark," Ms Nessel wrote.Michigan Senate President Pro Tem Jeremy Moss, another Democrat, said Ms Tlaib's comments were insensitive to Jewish people.On Monday, Georgia Republican Rich McCormick introduced a resolution to censure Ms Tlaib for "calling for the destruction of the state of Israel and dangerously promoting false narratives".Meanwhile, other progressive Democrats in Congress, like Pramila Jayapal from Washington, declined to side with Ms Tlaib's comments.Jon Finer, the White House deputy national security advisor, said on Sunday that the Biden administration disagrees "with some of that messaging and with some of the terms used to describe this conflict". More than 1,400 Israelis were killed in Hamas attacks on 7 October. Since then, more than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.The Biden administration has so far stopped short of calling for a ceasefire, but has become increasingly cautious in its language on the conflict as it seeks to balance competing interests.Mr Biden has repeatedly said that he supports Israel's right to defend itself, while pushing for pauses in fighting to allow humanitarian aid, food and water into Gaza.	
07/11/2023 07:35:00	Israel's pain still raw a month after Hamas attacks - BBC News	It was a day that shattered Israel's sense of its own invincibility and military might, undermining the security felt by every one of its citizens.But it did not seem so extraordinary at the start.  When I saw the early morning "red alerts" on my phone warning of incoming rocket fire from Gaza, we had no idea of the scale of the assault. I messaged my colleagues - some of whom were away for the end of the Jewish holidays - to say that I would head to the office.Soon I was struggling to absorb the impact of what I was saying on-air, even as the words left my mouth.  The intense missile fire which had me running in and out of the office air raid shelter turned out to be a cover for an unprecedented, complex, long-planned series of attacks.  We saw shocking images of Hamas fighters riding motorbikes through holes cut in Gaza's perimeter fence, paragliding into southern Israel, storming heavily fortified military bases and filming themselves in the gardens of overrun kibbutzim. Over painful hours, partygoers called into Israeli TV stations describing massacres as they hid from gunmen at the now notorious Nova Music Festival. Terrified residents shared videos of armed Palestinian squads on the streets of Sderot.  It was to prove to be the deadliest day in Israel's 75-year history with people murdered systematically and ruthlessly. From some of the kibbutzim close to Gaza, footage later emerged showing the cold-blooded massacre of entire families. Ultimately, some 1,400 are estimated to have been killed.  The significance of the timing was not lost - as this onslaught came almost exactly 50 years after a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria on the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur, sparked a major regional war.The raw pain and shock for ordinary Israelis, still evident now, was on full display when I went to Ashkelon on 8 October.  As Israeli security forces continued to battle heavily armed men literally along the road from us, and rocket sirens continued to blare, at the hospital, parents searched tearfully and collapsed in anguish searching for their missing children.   "Raze Gaza!" one tormented mother shouted.Early on in the war, there was a thirst for revenge and an urgent desire to restore Israel's deterrence in front of its enemies.  However, polls suggest this has since been complicated by growing fears about the impact that intense bombardment and a full-scale ground invasion could have on hostages snatched by Hamas. Some 240 people are thought to be held: Israelis and foreigners, soldiers and civilians and old and young.  Demonstrations and pleas to bring them home are becoming more urgent. After surviving the nightmare of the Hamas attacks in Nir Oz, the life of Hadas Kalderon is now transformed into desperately campaigning to bring home her two children, Erez, who turned 12 as a hostage in Gaza, Sahar, 16, and Hadas's ex-husband, Ofer. Her mother, Carmela Dan, and her niece, Noya, who were also abducted, have been found dead."I don't even have time to grieve [for] my mother and my niece because I have to fight for my children and their father that's still alive," Hadas recently told the BBC.  She calls for Israel to stop its military activity until the hostages are safe.Israel has rejected calls for a ceasefire without the release of all the hostages, and has continued bombarding Gaza from the air.On Monday, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said that more than 10,000 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since Israel started bombing it last month.More than 4,000 of those killed were children, the ministry added.What compounded the shock of 7 October was the realisation that Israel's military, the strongest in the Middle East, and its renowned intelligence forces had failed to detect the attacks.  Many long-time assumptions they had held, together with political leaders, also turned out to be seriously flawed.After Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, and Hamas took full control of the territory in 2007, Israeli authorities had tried to limit the threat it posed along with Islamic Jihad, its smaller ally, also designated as a terrorist group.It had become common to hear defence experts refer to Israel's strategy in Gaza as "mowing the lawn". The suggestion was that the capabilities of the armed factions could simply be cut back every now and then by Israeli forces - with all that meant in terms of casualties.  There were frequent major conflicts as recently as 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021. However, in two previous short rounds of violence in August last year and May this year, which targeted Islamic Jihad, Israel's military took false comfort that Hamas did not join in.  The conventional wisdom was that it did not want an escalation.Israel was thought to have bought relative quiet by giving work permits to some 18,000 Gazans and by allowing Qatar to give aid and pay Hamas civil servants' salaries.That assessment proved to be dangerously erroneous. It now seems clear that Hamas was actually biding its time while gaining better weapons, including longer-range rockets and drones, and improving its underground tunnel network.The idea that Israeli technology had also contained the threat from Hamas - particularly with the costly barrier that was built around Gaza complete with cameras, sensors and a deep concrete base to guard against tunnels - was also shown to be wrong.  Last month, thousands of fighters are said to have penetrated the fence in about 30 places.With war still raging, it is still too soon to give a full list of the mistakes made which led to 7 October.  Israel remains in a state of mourning with the bodies of some of the dead - burnt or mutilated - still unidentified and more soldiers being killed on the battlefield inside Gaza.However, a wide-ranging, post-war inquiry eventually seems likely. After a turbulent year in Israeli politics, questions may well be asked about the role of the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.Much still depends on how effectively Israel can achieve its new war goals - to dismantle Hamas in Gaza and release the hostages - and deal with the growing threats posed by Iran and its proxies in the region.One month on from those bloody events in southern Israel, the news remains relentless.

06/11/2023 21:46:00	Met Police urges pro-Palestinian march organisers to delay demo - BBC News	The Metropolitan Police has urged the organisers of pro-Palestinian demonstrations to postpone events due to take place on Armistice weekend.Thousands are expected to take part in a march in London on 11 November, the same day some Remembrance events are planned in the capital.Home Secretary Suella Braverman welcomed the Met's statement, which warned of potential disorder.Organisers criticised the force and refused to cancel the march.The Met warned of a "growing" risk of violence and disorder fuelled by breakaway groups linked to the protests.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan said: "This is of concern ahead of a significant and busy weekend in the capital."Our message to organisers is clear: Please, we ask you to urgently reconsider. It is not appropriate to hold any protests in London this weekend."A statement from the Met said it had spoken with organisers on Monday from several groups, and that they had "declined to postpone" any demonstrations - but this account was disputed by organisers.They said it was "categorically untrue that the police told us that it was not appropriate" to go ahead with the march, adding that they are "deeply concerned" by the statement.Organisers confirmed they won't postpone the march, and accused the government and "right wing political groups" of putting pressure on the police to intervene. The route of the pro-Palestinian march on Saturday runs from Hyde Park to the US Embassy in south London. It does not pass through Whitehall.No large demonstration is planned for Remembrance Sunday.Organisers have previously pointed out the Saturday march is due to begin almost two hours after the national two minutes' silence of commemoration.In the statement released on Monday night, signed by six organising groups including the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, they added: "The idea that it is acceptable for Israel to keep bombing and killing Palestinians in Gaza including over 4,000 children, but not for people to protest peacefully against these crimes is grotesque."The Met has so far stopped short of invoking a public order law whereby it can ask the Home Secretary Suella Braverman to ban a demonstration from taking place.Responding to the Met's statement, Ms Braverman said: "I welcome this statement from the Met Police. The hate marchers need to understand that decent British people have had enough of these displays of thuggish intimidation and extremism."Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Friday: "To plan protests on Armistice Day is provocative and disrespectful, and there is a clear and present risk that the Cenotaph and other war memorials could be desecrated, something that would be an affront to the British public and the values we stand for."He added that the police had the government's "full support in making robust use of all your powers to protect Remembrance activity", in a letter to Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley.Ms Braverman has previously described pro-Palestinian protests as "hate marches".Civil liberties group Liberty said police "should not be able to pick and choose what people can speak out about on any given day", adding "shutting down" protests would be a "wildly disproportionate response".Israeli President Isaac Herzog described the planned march as "atrocious". He told TalkTV: "I call upon all decent human beings to object to the march and ban it, because the symbol of that day is a symbol of victory."	
06/11/2023 21:26:00	South Africa recalls all diplomats from Israel - BBC News	South Africa says it is recalling all of its diplomats from Tel Aviv following Israel's intense air strikes on Gaza on Sunday night.The bombardment was one of Israel's heaviest since the war began a month ago.According to Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital, about 200 people were killed.South Africa's government, which has long been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause, staunchly condemned Israel on Monday.Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor told a press conference that South Africa was withdrawing its diplomats, saying: "We are... extremely concerned at the continued killing of children and innocent civilians in the Palestinian territories and we believe the nature of response by Israel has become one of collective punishment."We felt it important that we do signal the concern of South Africa while continuing to call for a comprehensive cessation [of hostilities]."Israel has insisted it is trying to minimise civilian casualties and accuses Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, of using non-combatants as human shields.On 7 October, fighters from Hamas - which the UK, US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation - killed more than 1,400 people in Israel. They also took more than 230 hostages, including one South African national who has not yet been identified.Israel has responded by vowing to destroy Hamas and carrying out numerous air strikes on Gaza. More than 10,000 people have been killed there since the siege began, the Hamas-run health ministry says.Lior Haiat, a spokesman for the Israeli minister of foreign affairs, posted a response on X (formerly Twitter), saying South Africa's decision to recall its diplomatic staff was a "victory for the Hamas terrorist organisation and rewards it for the massacre" of 7 October. "Israel expects South Africa to condemn Hamas, which is worse than Isis, and to respect Israel's right to defend itself against an attack by a horrific terrorist organisation that has engraved on its flag a call for the destruction of the State of Israel," Mr Haiat posted.South Africa's government has long backed the Palestinians in their conflict with Israel. The ruling African National Congress (ANC) often links the Palestinian cause to its own struggle against apartheid.The recall of the diplomats was "normal practice", Foreign Minister Pandor said, adding that the envoys would give a "full briefing" to the government. After this, the government will decide whether it can be of assistance or if a "continued relationship is actually able to be sustained", Ms Pandor said.South Africa's cabinet also accused Israeli ambassador Eliav Belotsercovsky of making derogatory remarks about South Africans, including members of government, who had criticised Israel's government."The disparaging remarks against those speaking up against the atrocities and the country's leaders make ambassador Belotsercovsky position more and more untenable," the cabinet statement said.South Africa is not the first country to recall its diplomats from Israel in protest against the military operation in Gaza - Chad, Chile and Colombia are among those to have already done so.	
06/11/2023 21:07:00	Humza Yousaf speaks of family tears after Gaza evacuation - BBC News	Humza Yousaf has described as "bittersweet" the return of his parents-in-law after four weeks of being under siege in Gaza.The first minister said his father-in-law has shed tears for the family members left behind.Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband Maged - the parents of Mr Yousaf's wife Nadia - escaped Gaza via the Rafah crossing on Friday. Mr Yousaf said their return to Scotland was "really emotional"."They are of course delighted that they are here but they are heartbroken that they had to leave family behind in Gaza," he told BBC Scotland News.He later told reporters he saw his father-in-law cry for the first time."He was really broken by the fact that he had to say goodbye to his mother, to his son, to their grandchildren, as well - the youngest of which is only three months old," the first minister said.He said their situation in Gaza had been"incredibly desperate" and that they had been forced to drink sea water after running out of supplies."We continue to watch the situation in Israel-Gaza with a lot of distress," the SNP leader told BBC Scotland News.Mr Yousaf reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire - a step which has not been supported by either the UK government or Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. "This is a pivotal moment, frankly, for the international community," Mr Yousaf said. "You are either on the side of humanity calling for an immediate ceasefire or you are enabling the suffering of 2.2 million men, women and children, the vast majority of whom are innocent."The first minister also said he was "beyond angry" at the UK government seeming to want to "drive every issue into a culture war".It came after Home Secretary Suella Braverman described a planned pro-Palestinian event in London on Armistice Day as a "hate march". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the Met Police had his "absolute and total backing" to tackle criminality.Speaking to journalists in Dundee, Mr Yousaf said: "I understand [the march] is taking place after the minute silence that we will all undoubtedly observe, I hear it's not going anywhere near Whitehall or, indeed, the Cenotaph."And, of course, if Armistice was about anything, my goodness, it's about peace."A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: "Remembrance Day is a time for national mourning and reflection, with the country united in paying tribute to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for us."Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, but the home secretary will always back the police to take action to prevent serious disruption and take a zero tolerance approach towards criminality."The first minister's in-laws, from Dundee, travelled to Gaza early last month to visit Mr El-Nakla's mother, who had a stroke in March but has now recovered.Mr Yousaf's brother-in-law, who is a hospital doctor, and his family remain in Gaza, as do his wife's stepmother and grandmother.Border crossings in and out of Gaza had been closed since 7 October, when Hamas, which is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK, attacked Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostage.Since then Israel has been carrying out military action in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 10,000 people have died.Pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied Glasgow's Queen Street train station on Monday, following similar demonstrations at Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central on Sunday. A rally was also held at the BBC Scotland headquarters in Glasgow. On Sunday, a silent vigil was held outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh to remember those who are being held hostage by Hamas.Heart-shaped balloons were attached to shoes to represent those who were kidnapped.	
06/11/2023 19:05:00	Irish-Israel girl Emily Hand's father say he is clinging on to hope - BBC News	The father of an Irish-Israeli girl who was thought to be dead after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October said the family can only hope they can get her back alive. Emily Hand, who is eight, is now believed to be a hostage of Hamas in Gaza.Her Dublin-born father Tom Hand was initially told she was among a group of people killed in an attack on a kibbutz.Speaking to BBC News in Israel, Mr Hand said his family now lived in hope after they were told by the Israeli Defense Forces that it was likely she was being held hostage."Now - the strong possibility that she's in Gaza - now it's hope, we can only hope that we can get her back alive," he said.Mr Hand previously said Emily had gone to stay at her friend's house in the kibbutz on the same day Hamas launched its attacks.Two days later the Israeli authorities told him they believed she was dead.But in recent days an official from the Irish embassy in Israel said tests indicated that Emily's DNA was not found among victims in Kibbutz Be'eri.In the aftermath of the attacks, Mr Hand said he was relieved that his daughter was not taken hostage because he feared for what could happen to her in Gaza.But he has now said he regrets making those comments."In some ways I regret that - just because of some of the things I said - some things that might have put her in danger - we move on," he said."It's her birthday this month - she's not even going to know it's her birthday - there'll be no cake, no party, no friends celebrating. "She'll still be living their in terror everyday - we want her back to love her again, hug her again - and never let her out of my sight."Emily was in Kibbutz Be'eri, about three miles from Gaza, when Hamas launched its attack.More than 100 people were killed in the kibbutz.They were among more than 1,400 Israelis killed by Hamas, which is designated a terrorist group by the UK and the United States, in attacks across southern Israel.Dozens of other people from the kibbutz are still missing and it is believed some of them may have been taken to Gaza as hostages.Emily's half sister, Natali Hand, has issued an appeal to the Irish government to help "get her back".At the last count, the Israeli Defense Forces said 242 people were being held hostage.Since the attacks, Israel has been bombing Gaza and its military has recently lanched ground operations.The Hamas-run health ministry said more than 10,000 people have been killed in the territory since the war began a month ago.Follow live: Latest updatesHostages: Children must be off limits, says father of abducted kidsFrom Gaza: Stories of those killed in GazaWatch: Breaking down videos from Gaza's secret tunnelsExplained: Ros Atkins on...

06/11/2023 17:59:00	Narges Mohammadi: Jailed Iranian Nobel laureate begins hunger strike - BBC News	Jailed Iranian human right activist Narges Mohammadi has begun a hunger strike, a month after she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, her family says.The 51-year-old is protesting against Iran's denial of medical care to her and other inmates and its mandatory hijab law, according to a statement.She needs treatment for heart and lung conditions but a prosecutor is blocking her transfer to hospital, it says.Last week, her family said that was because she refused to cover her hair.The chairwoman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee - which awarded Ms Mohammadi the peace prize for "her fight against the oppression of women in Iran" - said it was deeply concerned."The requirement that female inmates must wear a hijab in order to be hospitalised is inhumane and morally unacceptable," Berit Reiss-Andersen said, according to AFP news agency.There was no immediate comment from Iran's judiciary or prison authorities.The statement from Ms Mohammadi's family said they were informed in a message from Tehran's notorious Evin prison that she had started a hunger strike on Monday morning. It explained that she was protesting against two things: "the Islamic Republic's policy of delaying and neglecting medical care for sick inmates, resulting in the loss of the health and lives of individuals", and "the policy of 'death' or 'mandatory hijab' for Iranian women".A prosecutor had opposed Ms Mohammadi's transfer to hospital for treatment for a week, despite repeated appeals to prison officials and the judiciary, it said."According to the diagnosis and echocardiogram of a trusted doctor of the prison, she has been in need of emergency transfer to the heart and lung centre for urgent medical care."Last Wednesday, Ms Mohammadi's family said other female inmates at Evin had protested for two days and nights to put pressure on authorities to transfer her to hospital.However, they added, "the prison warden announced that, according to the orders of the higher authorities, sending her to the heart hospital without a headscarf was prohibited".Ms Mohammadi, the vice-president of the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran, is currently serving a 10-year prison term. She has been arrested 13 times in total, convicted five times and sentenced to a total of 31 years in prison. She has also been sentenced to 154 lashes, although it is unclear whether that punishment has been carried out.Under Iranian law, which is based on the country's interpretation of Sharia, women must cover their hair with a headscarf and wear long, loose-fitting clothing to disguise their figures.In September 2022, mass protests erupted across Iran in response to the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly wearing an "improper" hijab.Women and girls have burnt their headscarves or waved them in the air at demonstrations against the clerical establishment. Many have even stopped covering their hair in public altogether.In a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee published last Tuesday, Ms Mohammadi described the compulsory hijab as "a means of control and repression imposed on the society and on which the continuation and survival of [Iran's] authoritarian religious regime depends". 	
06/11/2023 17:29:00	Israel Gaza war: Hamas-run health ministry says Gaza death toll passes 10,000 - BBC News	The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 10,000 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since Israel started bombing it last month.More than 4,000 of those killed were children, the ministry said.The number surpasses the UN's figure of about 5,400 killed in Gaza in all of Israel's previous conflicts with Hamas since it took control of the territory in 2007.Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed 1,400 people and kidnapped more than 200 others on 7 October. It says it is destroying Hamas infrastructure and killing its fighters so that it will no longer be able to pose a threat to Israel.US President Joe Biden has previously questioned the accuracy of the health ministry's figures, while the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say that "any information provided by a terrorist organisation should be viewed with caution".Hamas is a proscribed terror organisation in many countries including the UK and US.However, World Health Organization (WHO) regional emergency director Richard Brennan, based in Cairo, said last week he believed the figures provided by the health ministry were trustworthy."We're confident that the information management systems that the ministry of health has put in place over the years stand up to analysis," he said, adding "the data over the years has been quite solid". On Sunday night, the Israeli military carried out one of its heaviest bombardments of the besieged Gaza Strip, saying on Monday that it had hit 450 targets over the past 24 hours.The Hamas-run health ministry said "more than 200 martyrs were reported in the overnight massacres". The director of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City told the BBC that people were using donkeys and their own cars to carry dead bodies, because communications had been cut and they could not reach ambulance services.The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) charity said this was the "third communications blackout" in Gaza since the war began - and it had lost contact with its teams.Communications were restored on Monday morning, but getting information from Gaza City remains difficult. The Israeli military says its troops have reached the coastline in the south of Gaza City, in effect dividing the territory in two.The heads of all major UN agencies have issued a rare joint statement calling for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire", saying "enough is enough"."For almost a month, the world has been watching the unfolding situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory in shock and horror at the spiralling numbers of lives lost and torn apart," the UN chiefs wrote.The heads of organisations including Unicef, the WHO and the World Food Programme - as well as charities such as Save the Children - have described the "horrific" loss of life on both sides. They have also released a statement to demand the unconditional release of the hostages taken by Hamas during its 7 October attacks."However, the horrific killings of even more civilians in Gaza is an outrage, as is cutting off 2.2 million Palestinians from food, water, medicine, electricity and fuel."The statement added that 88 people working for UNRWA, the agency focused on Palestinian refugees, had been killed since 7 October - representing the highest number of UN fatalities ever recorded in a single conflict.The UN - which is housing many of the 1.5 million displaced Gazans - says 48 of its sites across the Gaza Strip have been damaged since the war broke out.Israel has rejected the idea of a ceasefire - for which its Arab neighbours have also been calling - and for a humanitarian pause, which is the solution favoured by its ally, the United States.At the weekend, Mr Netanyahu said Israel rejected "a temporary ceasefire that does not include the release of our hostages" in a TV statement, minutes after a call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.He said that Israel was "continuing with all our force" against Hamas.	
06/11/2023 17:18:00	The writers who reached out across the divide - BBC News	They were the same age and shared a common language. Not Arabic. Not Hebrew. Not English. But something larger than words, a humanity that extended beyond the tongue of any tribe.Ahmed and Yuval. Palestinian and Israeli. Both 29 years old. Soft-spoken and intense, two writers who believed in describing things as they saw them. Ahmed lived behind a wall that confined two million people in the Gaza Strip. His friend Yuval lived on the other side in Jerusalem, the son of a middle-class Jewish family.They were brought together by stories. Yuval read Ahmed's accounts of Palestinian lives in Gaza on another website and reached out to him with an idea. What if he could find Israelis to translate the stories into Hebrew?"We talked for an hour and it was very, very interesting," recalls Yuval. "And when that hour ended, he told me, 'I never spoke to an Israeli person in my life.' And he said, 'Is it okay if I ask you some questions?'  From the interviewer, I became the interviewee. And we spoke for hours on that first call."Together they founded Across the Wall on Facebook. The title comes from the 37 miles (59.5km) of border barriers, 7m (23ft) high, separating the Palestinians in Gaza from Israeli territory. All movement in and out of Gaza is controlled by Israel.Ahmed encouraged Palestinian writers to share their work. Around two hundred Israelis volunteered to translate into Hebrew.The posts could draw angry responses from Israelis. As both men tell it, "blame Hamas for your problems" was a frequent response. "We have a bigger responsibility, a responsibility towards our families, our people in Gaza, who need a voice, and who need someone to call for justice for them," Ahmed says.The decades long conflict has produced dozens of groups dedicated to creating links between Israelis and Palestinians, from non-governmental organisations campaigning against the construction of settlements on Palestinian land, to womens' groups advocating peace, and organizations forging ties between Palestinian and Israeli children. Through all the years of conflict and political failure there have always been individuals and groups willing to try and stand - metaphorically - in the shoes of others. "I am someone who hates wars," Ahmed says. "I am someone who passionately and wholeheartedly believes in peace, and peaceful resistance. I will never call for wars."In 2019 Ahmed was given the opportunity to study in London. From there he continued writing online about Gaza.Then came the moment that triggered a devastating war. On October 7, Hamas attacked Israel killing 1,400 Israelis, the vast majority of them civilians. More than 200 Israelis were kidnapped and are still being held hostage in Gaza. Israeli society was traumatised. Vowing to destroy Hamas, the IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) launched a campaign of relentless airstrikes. A ground offensive would follow.From London, Ahmed monitored the news, thinking constantly of his family, besieged in Gaza. His relatives had gathered together for safety in the same apartment.Two weeks into the war, on 22 October, a missile hit the building killing 21 members of Ahmed's family. He lists the dead; "My father, two brothers, three sisters, 14 nieces and nephews who are children, who are kids under the age of 13." His mother had died of cancer three years earlier. All of a sudden he was alone. "Unless you have experienced what I have, you cannot understand what I am going through," he says. "I would not wish what has happened to me to happen to anybody, not to my worst enemy." In the photographs taken with his lost family, Ahmed's eyes are bright and happy, particularly with the young nephews and nieces he played games with and to whom he gave treats. These days Ahmed is constantly anxious and restless. He takes pills to try and help him sleep. "This is my life now," he says.When Yuval saw the news about Ahmed's family, at first he struggled to find the words to respond."And from that moment, I cried." Yuval says."I spent the entire day trying to write him something. I didn't really know what to say. I said how sorry I felt." Several days passed and Yuval began to wonder if he would ever again hear from his friend.Then came a voice message. It was Ahmed, his voice wracked with grief, but still a friend. He thanked Yuval for being in touch and said he respected him even more now. Ahmed said he was able to differentiate between Yuval and the Israeli pilot who dropped the bomb that killed his family.When I meet Yuval in Jerusalem he is careful not to try and speak for his friend. I want to know if they will work together in the future."I think you have to ask him," Yuval responds. "For me, I will. As I said to him, 'I made a commitment to you. I will not stop'." The stand Yuval takes is not without consequences. He has lost friends because of his advocacy of Palestinian rights. In the current heightened atmosphere of the war he is aware that the threat of violence "feels much closer than it was a month ago."When I put the question to Ahmed - will he write for an Israeli audience again? - he is cautious."I don't know if I will continue working for Across the Wall or not because right now, I feel a sense of failure. I believe that we failed in Across the Wall… our aim was to prevent these wars from happening, but we have failed."So right now, I don't know, how will I convince other Palestinians to write for Israelis after the massacres that they have endured, after the loss of lives and house?"But then he tells me that he will keep writing. Ahmed cannot be consoled with vague platitudes about peace and understanding. But the work he does with Yuval provides a glimpse of light in a time filled with pain."I want us to have a decent human life," he says. "We deserve it."With additional reporting from Haneen Abdeen, Alice Doyard, Morgan Gisholt Minard in Jerusalem	
06/11/2023 16:11:00	Israel-Gaza war: 'I couldn't believe it was possible to kidnap an 85-year-old woman' - BBC News	It has been nearly a month since Adva Adar's 85-year-old grandmother was kidnapped by Hamas and hustled across the border into Gaza on a golf cart.She was one of more than 200 people taken from Israel on 7 October, when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip.As the Israeli military continues to pound the territory with air strikes and encircles Gaza City, Adva says she is holding on to hope that the Israeli military is focused on rescuing the hostages. "If they are doing a ground invasion in Gaza, then they are doing it because this can help bring the hostages back," she says over the phone from Israel. "If I don't believe it, I can't have hope. And if I can't have hope, I have no reason to wake up in the morning. I need to believe she will be back."Adva had planned to visit her grandmother, Yafa, at the Kibbutz Nir Oz with her family on 7 October to mark the Jewish festival of Sukkot. But at 06:30 that morning, her grandmother wrote in the family chat that she was hiding from rocket fire in her shelter."Other members of my family [at the kibbutz] told me that the terrorists were going from house to house. They were burning the houses, shooting and kidnapping people," Adva says.After a few hours, she lost contact with her grandmother. But that evening, she was stunned to see a video that Hamas had posted online of Yafa."She was on a golf cart with four terrorists around her. I was terrified. I couldn't believe it was even possible to kidnap an 85-year-old woman from her bed. It is unhuman behaviour, beyond possible." Adva says that her grandmother's health is a huge concern. "She is ill, she has heart failure, kidney problems, blood pressure. She needs a lot of medication for her system to function, to release the pain she's in. She almost can't walk or sit straight.""Every hour that's passing is an hour I don't know if she made it."Yafa Adar was one of the founding members of Kibbutz Nir Oz and had lived there for 60 years. She worked as a dental assistant, in the library and looked after the children. A mother of three, a grandmother of eight and a great-grandmother seven times over, Yafa is not the only member of the Adar family who was caught up in the deadly Hamas attacks. Her grandson Tamir - Adva's cousin - is missing. He left his wife and two children in the shelter of their family home in Nir Oz and went to protect his community as soon as he heard that Hamas gunmen were in the kibbutz. At 08:00 he called his wife. "He didn't think that they were going to make it," Adva tells me. "He told her not to open the door to anyone and he said his goodbye."Tamir has not been heard from since. The family don't know if he was taken to Gaza, murdered or injured. Adva also has a grandfather, an aunt and another cousin, who survived the attacks. Her grandfather, Yoram, "aged 50 years in a day. When the terrorists couldn't kidnap him, they burnt his house. He inhaled a lot of smoke, he was in a critical condition in the hospital for a few days, but now he is doing better," Adva says. "He is scared of everything. Scared is not an emotion I would have ever used to describe him in the past... He might survive this," she says, "but mentally I don't know for how long." Adva's aunt Vered had to run for her life after gunmen got into her house, filled it with cooking gas and set it on fire. "She's OK physically, but they are traumatised in a very severe way," Adva says. "How will they ever feel safe if you can't feel safe in your house? If you don't know you can go to bed and feel safe in your bed. I don't know how you recover from something like this."Adva says that her family have nothing to go back to. Her aunt left in her pyjamas and her glasses. "Everything was destroyed and what wasn't destroyed was stolen... And it's so sad, because it was heaven in that kibbutz. It became hell in minutes."	
06/11/2023 16:10:00	Father appeals for safe passage of children after wife killed in Gaza - BBC News	A Belfast-born man whose wife and other family members were killed in Gaza has said there is no safe passage for his children who remain there.Khalid El-Estal said he was working in Saudi Arabia while his family stayed in the Palestinian territory.His children - four-year-old Ali and one-year-old Sara - are in Gaza with their grandparents.He said he was working to find a way out for them so he can bring them to Belfast.Sinn Féin TD Chris Andrews said he would be raising Mr El-Estal's case with the Irish government.Gaza has been bombed by Israel as part of its conflict with Hamas.Mr El-Estal, 30, returned to Ireland after his wife, Ashwak Jendia, was killed along with his mother, brother, uncle and two cousins.Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas, which is a designated terrorist group according to the UK and the US, killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200 others.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 10,000 people had been killed in the territory since 7 October.On Monday, Mr El-Estal told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster the killing of his family members was "the worst nightmare you can ever have".He said he fears for his children's lives without assistance from the Irish authorities. "We are hoping for many things, they are working on the documents to take them out," he said."There are lists for the Rafah crossing border, people who can leave."That's one problem, the second problem is I told my father-in-law and my brothers-in-law that I want the children out."They were afraid to take them, it is dangerous."There is no safe passage, it is not safe."Mr El-Estal, who is currently in Belfast, said he would like to bring his children here."I was growing up here. I have a lot of memories here," he added. "I was all the time telling her [Ashwak] about Belfast. All the time seeing these beautiful views... there's nothing like this in Gaza. It was our dream to be here together."Mr Andrews said Mr El-Estal was in a "terrible position" and it was important that, as an Irish citizen, his children get "safe passage" and are reunited with him."I think that it is important he has the trauma support, counselling support and I will certainly be looking to raise this, and I know other members of the Dáil (lower house of Irish Parliament) will be looking to do the same with the Tánaiste."Ultimately it is about ensuring that there is access out of Gaza for people like Khalid's family and that seems to be the big stumbling block at the moment, there is no movement, there are no Irish citizens being allowed out yet."That's what we have to push for and the Tánaiste Micheál Martin and the government have to push for that."Mr El-Estal was born in Belfast and attended primary school in the Botanic area while his father worked as a lecturer at Queen's University.When he was aged eight, the family relocated to Gaza, where Khalid met his wife, Ashwak Jendia, at university.As violence in the region escalated last month, Mr El-Estal said he urged his wife to move south and stay with his relatives, while he contacted Irish officials to seek help."The exact day she [arrived] in my family's place they bombed the place," Mr El-Estal said.The bomb killed his mother and brother "immediately", he added.He added that his uncle, and his uncle's two daughters - both doctors - were also killed in the blast, and both of Khalid's children were buried in rubble. Ashwak was taken to hospital, eventually dying from her injuries, which included 60% burns to her body, he said."It's killing me," he said. "I lost everything, it's not only me, I am better (off) than a lot of people in Gaza," Mr El-Estal said.In a previous statement, an Irish Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said more than 8,000 foreign and dual nationals are in Gaza.This includes thousands of dependent children who are entitled to dual citizenship in various countries.However, the spokesperson said evacuations will take some time to complete.	
06/11/2023 13:09:00	Gaza's Christians fear for survival amid Israel-Hamas war - BBC News	During the past month of brutal fighting, every day Pope Francis has been calling the priest and parishioners crammed into Gaza City's Holy Family Church to check on them.He offers prayers and his full sympathy.For George Anton, who is sheltering in the church compound with his wife and three daughters, the contact brings comfort but little hope of protection."We trust Pope Francis, but we don't trust others to listen to the voice of peace," he says despairingly. "I don't know how to describe the feeling. It's a very scary thing. You feel you sit waiting for your turn to die. You don't know when and you don't know how or why."George, who works for the Roman Catholic charity Caritas, tells me he has had to have tough conversations with his daughters aged just eight, 10 and 12."I am telling them the whole truth. I say we are with Jesus, but I also tell them that they are in a war," he explains. "Sometimes, I leave them to go to get bread, to bring medicine or clothes, and every time I go, I say, 'Goodbye. If I return back, all's ok. If not, guys, that's it.'"He says that there is no keeping his girls from the horror of death and destruction."This is what they hear from 600 people around them in the church, watching videos on the internet. This is what they see from the bombardment all around. They do not sleep at night because they're terrified. The sound of the rockets is like Hell."  When Israeli forces ordered more than a million residents to move from the northern part of the Gaza Strip to the south, hundreds of thousands did not heed the instruction.  Many from the small Christian community, which numbers about 1,000, instead took their families to stay in their churches, thinking they would be safe there, as they have been in previous rounds of fighting between Israel and Palestinian armed factions.After a deadly Israeli air strike hit an outbuilding of the Greek Orthodox Church of St Porphyrius - the site of one of the world's oldest churches - all sense of security was lost.  The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem described the attack as a "war crime". Israel's military said its target had been a nearby Hamas command centre used to launch rockets.Amid scenes of despair, the bodies of those crushed to death were laid out wrapped in white sheets in the church courtyard for a mass funeral on 20 October. Eighteen Christian women, men and children were killed.  In the occupied West Bank, churches have held special prayers to show solidarity with everyone suffering in Gaza and remember the dead. Many Gazan Christians have relatives here, although Israel's permit system has made it hard for them to meet up in recent years.At a church in Beit Sahour, Shireen Awwad lights a candle for her aunt who was killed in St Porphyrius. "I'm really heartbroken. We cannot think, we're paralysed," she says.  Shireen still has cousins and uncles in Gaza City as well as another aunt, who was injured in the church blast and then endured hip replacement surgery without anaesthesia at Shifa Hospital because of the shortage of medical supplies.She says her relatives are proud natives of Gaza who have stayed there through successive wars."Every time we asked them: 'do you want to leave?' They would say, 'no, these are our roots. This is where we were born'," Shireen says. "But this time, for the first time, they don't know if they want to stay, that is if they actually survive."The Christian population of the small coastal strip has a long history. St Porphyrius was a fifth century bishop of Gaza whose tomb lies under the church.  Many Christians have moved away, particularly since 2007, when Hamas took full control of Gaza.  Israel, like many other countries, designates the Islamist movement as a terrorist group. Along with Egypt, it imposed a crippling blockade on Gaza after the takeover.  Reverend Dr Munther Isaac, a Lutheran pastor in Bethlehem, says that following events in Gaza has left him feeling "shell-shocked and broken".  He also fears for the future of one of the oldest Christian communities in the world.  "In the first council of Churches, there were representatives of the Church in Gaza," he says.  "We're concerned about every human life but after all is done, one of our biggest concerns is that this long, long tradition of Christian presence in Gaza might come to an end."While Pope Francis has called for a ceasefire, Palestinian Christians express disappointment in the public comments of other Church leaders concerning the war, particularly the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who is head of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the 85 million-strong Anglican Communion.  Anglicans in the West Bank accused him of prioritising "domestic British ecumenical and political considerations" over recognition of Palestinian rights. In Gaza City, where Israeli shelling last week left the Greek Orthodox Cultural Centre in ruins, George Anton is watching with growing despair."We are innocent people. We have no involvement in politics or military activity whatsoever. We are civilians. Why should we be a target? For what?" he asks.  "We have lost many friends. Some evacuated to [the southern city of] Khan Younis to stay with their relatives and they were all killed. They were hit by a rocket and all the buildings were demolished on their heads. They're all dead, but we have no time to feel sad."Every day you hear this person was killed, this family, this home was destroyed, this institution was wiped out. We cannot carry all this."In the end, he pledges to stay in the church with his family.  "We have had so many calls to evacuate, but we will not leave," he tells me. "This is where we belong. This is our home."	
06/11/2023 12:30:00	Ahed Tamimi: Israeli forces arrest Palestinian activist in West Bank - BBC News	The prominent Palestinian activist Ahed Tamimi has been arrested by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank.Ms Tamimi, 22, was detained overnight in the village of Nabi Saleh, the Palestinian Prisoners' Society said.Israel's military told AFP news agency she was suspected of "inciting violence and terrorist activities".Israeli media reported that Ms Tamimi was arrested in connection with a post on Instagram that threatened to "slaughter" Jewish settlers."[By comparison] you will say that what Hitler did to you was a joke," she is purported to have written, referring to the mass murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany, according to the newspaper Haaretz. The post is no longer visible online, nor is the account carrying Ms Tamimi's name and photo where it was published last week. Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, posted a photograph on X, formerly known as Twitter, that appeared to show an Israeli soldier restraining Ahed Tamimi in a bedroom. He accused her of expressing "sympathy and support for the Nazi human beings on social media" and vowed: "Zero tolerance with terrorists and supporters of terrorism!"However, Ms Tamimi's mother, Nariman, denied that she wrote the post."There are dozens of [online] pages in Ahed's name with her photo, with which she has no connection," she told AFP.Ahed Tamimi became an international symbol of resistance to Israel's occupation as a teenager. In 2015, the then-14-year-old was photographed biting an Israeli soldier who was trying to detain her younger brother.  Two years later, she was arrested after being filmed slapping and kicking an Israeli soldier during a confrontation outside her home. An Israeli court subsequently sentenced her to eight months in prison.The Palestinian Prisoners' Society said Ms Tamimi was one of at least 70 Palestinians arrested in Israeli raids across the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem on Sunday night.That raised to 2,150 the total reportedly detained there since 7 October, when Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 were taken hostage.Israel has bombarded Gaza continuously since then and sent in ground forces more than a week ago with the aim of destroying Hamas. More than 9,700 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The West Bank has seen an alarming surge in violence at the same time.According to the UN, 141 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, most of them during confrontations that followed Israeli search-and-arrest raids or during protests in solidarity with Gaza. It says eight others have been killed by Israeli settlers, who human rights groups have accused of escalating a campaign of violent attacks on Palestinian communities. Two Israelis have been killed by Palestinians over the same period.Some 600,000 Jews live in 140 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.	
06/11/2023 10:35:00	What is Israel's Iron Dome missile system and how does it work? - BBC News	Israel says its Iron Dome missile defence system has helped protect the country against rockets fired by the Hamas militant group from Gaza. The Israeli military says that without it, casualties would have been "far higher" during the current conflict. However, some incoming rockets have fallen on built-up areas.Iron Dome is designed to protect against incoming short-range weapons. It operates in all weather conditions. It uses radar to track rockets and can differentiate between those that are likely to hit built-up areas and those that are not. Interceptor missiles are only fired at rockets expected to strike populated areas. The system consists of batteries located across Israel, each with three to four launchers that can fire 20 interceptor missiles. There are both fixed and mobile versions of the system.Iron Dome was developed after the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, a militant group based in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah launched thousands of rockets into Israel, causing huge damage and killing dozens of citizens.In response, Israel said it would develop a new missile defence shield. Iron Dome was created by Israeli firms Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries, with some US support.It was specially designed to help combat rudimentary weapons like the rockets fired from Gaza.The system was first used in combat in 2011. It knocked out a missile fired from the Gaza Strip, which has been under Hamas control since 2007. In 2019, the US announced it would buy and test some Iron Dome batteries.Israel's military has claimed a success rate of up to 90% for Iron Dome.Hamas said that on the first day of its attack it launched 5,000 rockets, although Israel says it probably launched half that number. The rockets were fired in a short space of time in an attempt to overwhelm Iron Dome. Others have been fired from Lebanon by Hezbollah.The Israeli Defense Forces said more than 8,000 rockets have been fired at Israel since 7 October.  Some rockets have evaded Iron Dome and fallen on built-up areas causing several deaths and injuries, according to Israeli media. On 27 October, four people were injured when a rocket hit an apartment building in Tel Aviv.However, Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said: "The number of Israelis killed and wounded would be far higher if it had not been for the Iron Dome system, which has been a life saver as it always is."The US has said it will reinforce Israel's anti-rocket defence by handing over two of the Iron Dome batteries that it operates in Israel.It will also supply a battery of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missiles and batteries of Patriot missiles.	
05/11/2023 23:45:00	Few reasons for optimism after Antony Blinken's diplomatic dash - BBC News	For three days, the US's top diplomat, Antony Blinken, has been dashing around the Middle East, trying to contain a situation that threatens to spin out of control.Israel on Friday. Jordan on Saturday. The West Bank, Iraq and Turkey on Sunday.Every stop posed its own challenges and gave reason to be pessimistic that much progress is being made. The central challenge facing the US secretary of state is that he is trying to find a middle ground where none, at the moment, exists.On Friday, Mr Blinken encouraged Israeli leaders to make temporary pauses in hostilities in order to ease humanitarian aid and encourage hostage releases - a move the Israeli prime minister quickly rejected.The next day, he met representatives of Israel's Arab neighbours. They all called for an immediate ceasefire. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said Israel was committing war crimes.At roughly the same time back in the US, President Joe Biden was asked whether progress was being made toward securing those humanitarian pauses. He gave a thumbs up and replied "good".The president's optimism stood in stark contrast to the mood on the ground here in the Middle East.As if to underscore the tension in the region, Mr Blinken's Sunday stops were done under cover of secrecy. He travelled to Ramallah to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in a convoy of armoured SUVs and vans, speeding through streets cordoned off by soldiers from the Palestinian Palace Guard.He arrived in Iraq under cover of darkness. The secretary and his diplomatic entourage donned body armour and helmets for the short helicopter ride from the Baghdad airport to the US embassy, where he then motorcaded to a meeting with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani.  On Monday, he will meet Turkish officials - just one day after Turkey's President, Recip Erdogan, recalled his country's ambassador to Israel and said he was done dealing with Mr Netanyahu. "We have erased him, thrown him out," the Turkish leader said.Every time Mr Blinken puts one fire out, another seems to pop up.I asked Mr Blinken at the Baghdad airport if he shared the US president's optimism about the chances of convincing Israel to agree to pauses and in getting the Arabs to accept that a ceasefire is unrealistic at this point.He said yes to both.The Americans are continuing to work with the Israelis to address concerns about the "specifics and the practicalities" of how humanitarian pauses could be implemented.As for the Arabs, he said there were differences of opinion on a ceasefire, but everyone he had spoken with believed humanitarian pauses could help win the release of hostages, increase aid distribution in Gaza and expedite getting foreign citizens out of Gaza."We've had important progress there in recent days," he said, but "there are also real complications that come along with it."For the moment, however, no one seems to be buying what Mr Blinken is selling, in part because both the Israelis and the Arab nations are dealing with their own domestic pressures pulling the two sides apart.On Friday, as Mr Blinken stood before press cameras with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in central Tel Aviv, chants and horns could be heard - the sound of Israeli protesters calling for the government to do more to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October."Our heart goes out to them," Mr Herzog said.Meanwhile, in countries across the region - and in Europe and the US - pro-Palestinian protesters have taken to the street en masse. Demonstrators climbed the fence outside the White House in Washington DC and filled the streets in Paris, London and Berlin.In Istanbul, protesters held up a sign that called Mr Blinken "an accomplice of the massacre".If a positive spin can be put on Mr Blinken's trip so far, it's that he is speaking with all sides and, for the moment, the conflict has not spread. After Joe Biden's October meeting with Arab leaders in Jordan was abruptly cancelled following the explosion at a Gaza hospital, Mr Blinken's foreign minister gathering on Saturday was an indication of some progress.However, the secretary of state's attempts to encourage his Arab counterparts to start thinking about the long-term future for the Palestinians, and a means to ensure a "durable" peace in the region, were less successful."How can we even entertain what will happen in Gaza when we do not know what kind of Gaza will be left after this war is done?" Jordan's Mr Safadi asked. "Are we going to be talking about a wasteland? Are we going to be talking about a whole population reduced to refugees?"In a meeting with Jewish community leaders at the White House on 12 October, Joe Biden said he thought that the end result of the tragedy and bloodshed in Israel and Gaza would be a Middle East that was changed for the better."But then again, I have been referred to as a congenital optimist," the US president added.On the ground here in the region, such optimism has proven to be a rare commodity.	
05/11/2023 22:59:00	Emily Hand: Irish-Israeli girl feared dead 'may be hostage' - BBC News	An Irishman who was told his eight-year-old daughter had been killed by Hamas in Israel has now been told that she may still be alive. Dublin-born Tom Hand was initially informed that Emily Hand was among a group of people killed in an attack on a kibbutz on 7 October. The Irish embassy in Israel confirmed to Irish broadcaster RTÉ that Emily was now believed to have been abducted rather than killed.An official from the embassy said tests had shown her DNA was not found among victims in Kibbutz Be'eri.Speaking to RTÉ, external on Sunday, Emily's family said the Israeli Defense Forces now believed there was a "high possibility" she was among the people being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.Emily was in Kibbutz Be'eri, about three miles from Gaza, when Hamas launched its attack.More than 100 people were killed in the kibbutz.They were among more than 1,400 Israelis killed by Hamas in attacks across southern Israel.Dozens of other people from the kibbutz are still missing and it is believed some of them may have been taken to Gaza as hostages. At the last count, the Israeli Defense Forces said 242 people were being held hostage by Hamas.Days after the attack, Tom Hand gave an emotional interview to the US broadcaster CNN.He said Emily had gone to stay at her friend's house in the kibbutz on 7 October and two days later the Israeli authorities told him they believed she was dead. Emily's half-sister Natalie Hand has told an Israeli TV channel that the family was informed on 31 October that she might be among the hostages."We were told that she had been murdered. We were in mourning," Natalie Hand said, according to a report in the Times of Israel, external.In a direct message to her missing sister, Ms Hand added: "I want to tell you that we are doing everything to get you home. "We know you are being held hostage. We love you so much and miss you."Ms Hand told the channel that Emily also had Irish citizenship.The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs said it was "aware of the case of Emily Hand and is providing consular assistance to her family"."We will not be commenting further at this time," it added. Since the Hamas attacks of 7 October, Israel has been carrying out military action in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 9,700 people have been killed.	
05/11/2023 19:37:00	British Gaza evacuees have three days to leave Egypt - BBC News	British people and other foreign nationals who have fled Gaza only have 72 hours - three days - in Egypt before they need to leave.Hundreds of foreign nationals were evacuated from Gaza into Egypt through the Rafah Crossing on Friday.The border was then closed all weekend.The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said: "We remain in contact with British nationals in the region to provide them with the latest information."It added in a statement that it was "using all diplomatic channels to press for the crossing to reopen in coordination with our international partners".Nasser Alshanti, an academic from Manchester, told BBC News his pregnant daughter Yosra is effectively "stuck" in Egypt because her husband isn't a British citizen, and are worried they won't be able to leave before the three days are up.Yosra was raised in the UK and moved to Gaza for university in 2015, where she met - and then married - Ibrahim. The couple had lived in central Gaza since then, until they had to flee in the first week of the war when their neighbourhood was bombed.They were evacuated from Gaza into Egypt via the southern border crossing at Rafah at the end of last week, and are now in Cairo.Because Ibrahim is not a British national, they now need to apply for a Family Visa for him before they can travel to the UK. But the 72-hour deadline in Egypt means they are worried about overstaying if they don't get a visa in time. Under current rules, overstaying would mean having to pay a fine, which could be greater the longer they stay. "I thought they would give him an emergency visa or something, a very quick visa just to evacuate them from Cairo before the end of the 72 hours," Dr Alshanti said. A British Family Visa application submitted outside the UK normally takes up to six months to process. The FCDO and Home Office are working together to approve visas for non-British family members of British people who've been evacuated from Gaza, with a sped-up process that they expect to be much quicker than usual. However, it's not yet known how long this will take. Dr Alshanti said that sheltering in Gaza in the last few weeks, and now the stress of being in limbo in Egypt, has taken its toll on his daughter."I've just done a video call with her," he said. "You can tell from her face how much weight she's lost. The last time I saw Yosra was in August, which was just three months ago - but she's totally different. You can see how her eyes [are sunken] and her face is quite pale."For a heavily pregnant lady, after three weeks in a shelter with a small amount of food and water and no electricity - what do you expect?"	
05/11/2023 17:22:00	Humza Yousaf's in-laws who were trapped in Gaza arrive back in Scotland - BBC News	Humza Yousaf's in-laws have arrived back in Scotland after being trapped for four weeks in Gaza.The family of Scotland's first minister were reunited after they managed to cross into Egypt on Friday.Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband Maged - the parents of Mr Yousaf's wife Nadia - were allowed to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing.Mr Yousaf confirmed the news on X, formerly Twitter, and posted a photo of the reunion.He said: "I am pleased to say my in-laws are safe and back home."The post included some Arabic script, which translates as "praise be to God".Some of Mr Yousaf's relatives who do not hold UK passports remain in Gaza. He continued: "We are, of course, elated, but my father-in-law said, 'My heart is broken in two, and with my mum, son and grandchildren in Gaza.' He then broke down telling me how hard it was saying goodbye to them."Our thoughts remain with those who can't leave and are trapped in a war zone. We will continue to raise our voices for peace and to stop the killing of innocent men, women and children in Gaza."This has been a traumatic few weeks. I can't begin to tell you the impact it has had on Nadia and our family, particularly my in-laws. I'm sure they will tell their story in time. In the meantime, we ask that their privacy is respected."The couple travelled to Gaza early last month to visit Mr El-Nakla's mother, who had a stroke in March but has now recovered.Mr Yousaf's brother-in-law, who is a hospital doctor, and his family remain in Gaza, as do his wife's stepmother and grandmother. Mr and Mrs El-Nakla, from Dundee, had spent the past two weeks in a house where 100 people were sheltering, including a child of two months old.They had travelled to the border in an attempt to leave on three previous occasions without success.The BBC understands the couple arrived at Edinburgh airport at about 10:30 on Sunday morning.Border crossings in and out of Gaza had been closed since 7 October, when Hamas, which is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK, attacked Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostage.Since then Israel has been carrying out military action in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 9,700 people have died.The Palestinian border authority has been issuing lists of those who can present themselves at the crossing with their passports. Friday's list named more than 90 British citizens, with 88 on Saturday's list.On Sunday, the Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden confirmed more than 100 UK citizens had made it out of Gaza.It was thought there were around 200 British nationals there before war broke out.Up to 500 foreign nationals had been leaving Gaza per day via the Raffah crossing into Egypt since Wednesday but the "controlled" evacuations were halted on Saturday.A source has told the BBC they would resume again on Sunday. The evacuations via the border, which is controlled by the Egyptian authorities, have been conducted over "time-limited periods".Hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied two of Scotland's biggest railway stations during a day of protests on Saturday.In Edinburgh Waverley station, protesters could be heard chanting "free Palestine" and "ceasefire now".In Glasgow, supporters held a sit-down protest before marching to the BBC Scotland headquarters for a rally.On Sunday, a silent vigil was held outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh to remember those who are being held hostage by Hamas.Heart-shaped balloons were attached to shoes to represent those who were kidnapped.	
05/11/2023 16:15:00	At least 45 killed at Al-Maghazi refugee camp - BBC News	The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 45 people have been killed in what it said was an Israeli air strike at the Al-Maghazi refugee camp.Israel's military says it is looking into whether it was operating in the area at the time.The small camp has been experiencing overcrowding because of people fleeing bombardments further north.  Efforts are under way to find those still missing. It is thought more than 100 people were there at the time.The head of Gaza's Al-Aqsa hospital said 52 people were killed in the blast on Saturday night, slightly more than the number given by the health ministry. Residents have been trying to dig with their hands through layers of cement in an attempt to extract those trapped under the rubble.Photojournalist Muhammad Al-Alul lost his wife and four of his five children. He had been reporting elsewhere when the blast happened. "It did not occur to me that my children might be buried under the rubble," he told the BBC. "I wish I had been with them and been killed with them."The BBC has asked Israel's military to comment on the incident. While there has been no official response yet, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman told the BBC he was unable to confirm whether the camp was hit by an Israeli air strike. Speaking to BBC World Service's Newshour, Lt Col Peter Lerner added that any strikes taking place in southern Gaza were "specific intelligence-based strikes, specifically against terrorist elements".Mr Lerner said that this did not mean that "there can't unfortunately be deaths".The Al-Maghazi camp is in the area where Israel advised people in the north of Gaza to evacuate to for safety as they continue their campaign to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its 7 October attacks on Israel. However, air strikes in the south have not stopped."There is no safe place in Gaza," Muhammad, a civil defence officer who rushed to the scene of Saturday's strike to help, told the BBC. "They ask the Palestinians to go to the south, but kill them everywhere - on the roads, in schools where people are sheltering, and even in hospitals."The death toll in Gaza since 7 October is now more than 9,700, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.More than 1,400 people were killed in the attacks by Hamas on Israel and more than 200 people were taken hostage.	
05/11/2023 15:31:00	Rafah crossing: More than 100 Britons leave Gaza but dozens remain - BBC News	More than 100 British people have left Gaza this week - and it is hoped more will be evacuated on Sunday, the deputy prime minister has told the BBC. Oliver Dowden told Laura Kuenssberg it was "disappointing" the Rafah crossing was closed on Saturday.He said the government was "engaging closely" with authorities there and hoped it would reopen soon.The Rafah crossing was opened for three days earlier this week, with dozens of Britons named as eligible to leave.The Palestinian border authority has been issuing lists of those who can present themselves at the crossing with their passports. Friday's list named more than 90 British citizens, with 88 on Saturday's list. Before Mr Dowden's comments, it was not clear how many had actually managed to leave.As well as some foreign passport holders and their dependents, some wounded Palestinians were also allowed to leave Gaza via the border crossing and enter Egypt. But on Saturday, hundreds with foreign passports went to the border but were not allowed to cross. Sources from the crossing authorities on the Palestinian side told the BBC that movement of people with foreign passports was not being allowed until there was agreement on the safety of transferring injured patients.There has been no official statement from the authorities as yet.It was thought there were around 200 British nationals in Gaza before war broke out. Mr Dowden said: "The first thing we are doing is trying to make sure we get the Rafah crossing open again and I'm hopeful we will make progress on that today. "Secondly, we are seeking to have these temporary pauses to allow humanitarian aid in and to get our people out." Among Britons who have left are the in-laws of Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf.Elizabeth and Maged El-Nakla - the parents of Mr Yousaf's wife Nadia, were allowed to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing on Friday. They had been trapped there after war broke out while they were visiting their son and grandchildren.Mr Yousaf, writing on X, said there were mixed feelings."We are of course elated, but my father-in-law said 'My heart is broken in two, with my mum, son and grandchildren in Gaza'. He then broke down telling me how hard it was saying goodbye to them."Mr Dowden urged Britons remaining in Gaza to contact the Foreign Office.The Foreign Office said: "This continues to be a complex and challenging situation and we are using all diplomatic channels to press for its reopening in coordination with our international partners. "We remain in contact with British nationals in the region to provide them with the latest information." Border crossings in and out of Gaza have been closed since 7 October, when Hamas, which is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK, attacked Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostage.Since then, the Israeli military has launched a massive bombing campaign on Gaza, placed the strip under a "complete siege" and recently launched a ground assault on the north of Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,400 people have been killed. It is thought 14 Britons died in the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel. Mr Dowden said three Britons remained unaccounted for, but he was unable to say whether or not they had been taken hostage. Abdelkader Hammad, a British transplant surgeon who lives in Liverpool, left through the Rafah crossing on Thursday after being trapped for weeks. He told BBC Breakfast: "It was a terrifying experience really with all the explosions around us and the shrapnel and the concrete coming down, the glass broke, and the ceiling coming down [...] but this is the picture in Gaza. "In fact, we were the lucky ones there because we are protected by the UN. But for other people, there isn't shelter." Dr Hammad added: "And I can smell, the smell of death really, because there are still a lot of bodies under the rubble."He later told BBC Radio 5 live: "I can't stop thinking about my colleagues who I left there and the patients I usually treat in Gaza."I think many of them [kidney patients] will die to due to lack of treatment during this period."Many of those trapped in Gaza and seeking to leave have family in the UK urgently watching the situation. Faras Abuwarda's wife and five children - aged between three and 11 - have been named on a list of those allowed to leave but they are stuck in the north and cannot get to Rafah. Mr Abuwarda, who travelled with his family to see relatives but then returned to London for work, said: "The situation is a disaster. We are disgusted at the British government as they aren't able to help us. "What we ask for is safe travel to the border, nothing else, and we're unable to get it." He is waiting in Cairo, Egypt, and says his children are "frustrated, hopeless, and feel isolated". Omar Mofeed, from London, said his brother and pregnant wife, along with their three children, also do not believe it is safe to travel through Gaza. "The British foreign ministry called us saying Israel has allowed a safe route [...] then people start going, and Israel attacked people who are walking on this safe route," he said. The Israeli military has said it does not target civilians. Icel Chumlukh said his wife Lamia, his 13-year-old stepdaughter and the couple's one-year-old son had turned up at the border but were asked to leave. While his wife and son are on the list, his step-daughter is not - but his wife took her anyway, "hoping for a miracle". He said his son now "screams every time he hears a bang, or when someone closes a door" because they remind him of the sound of airstrikes.Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

05/11/2023 13:50:00	Surgeon who left Gaza urges UK government to do more - BBC News	A surgeon who escaped from the war in Gaza has said the UK government should do more to get British nationals out.Abdelkadar Hammad, who works at Royal Liverpool Hospital, is among 100 UK citizens who have left since Thursday.However, he believes they could have got out of Gaza in the week after war began if there had been "concerted pressure from our government".Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said the UK was trying to ensure people could leave "as rapidly as possible".Dr Hammad said he was "very happy" to have been able to leave the war-torn region but he was also "sad about the continuing loss of life in Gaza, especially children"."I would like to see more efforts to stop all this bloodshed, really, in Gaza."What is the Rafah crossing?Dr Hammad, who has visited Gaza regularly over the past decade to provide medical support, told BBC Radio 5 Live: "I think that the British government and probably all western governments have to make effort and put pressure on the parties there to get the people out."I thought we could have been out in the first week of the conflict if there was a concerted pressure from our government to get us out, and they should not have left us with our lives at risk there."The surgeon arrived in Gaza on 6 October to perform four kidney transplant operations and had been scheduled to leave three days later.However, he had to seek shelter when war broke out following the Hamas attacks in Israel, in which 1,400 people were killed and about 240 hostages taken.Since then, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,700 people have been killed in the Strip amid the Israeli bombardment."I can't stop thinking about my colleagues who I left there and the patients I usually treat in Gaza," Dr Hammad said."I think many of them [kidney patients] will die due to lack of treatment during this period and obviously those people will not be accounted for as victims of the war."But the conditions there - especially the medical situation there, which is disastrous - will cause a lot of deaths in this group of patients."Dr Hammad said many people in Gaza were living "without sanitation, water and food"."People are fighting for bread, for flour… if this continues for any time longer, then I think there will be a breakout of diseases."His son Salim said it had been a "stressful four weeks" for their family."Seeing him come out of the airport was just such a relief and it was bittersweet as well, knowing that he was able to come out, because we're lucky to have British passports and to be from England. "But there are people who were not able to leave and it was bittersweet to think about everything that he's left behind there."There were thought to be about 200 British nationals in Gaza before war broke out, with more than 100 having got out in the past few days.Mr Dowden told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: "The first thing we are doing is trying to make sure we get the Rafah crossing open again and I'm hopeful we will make progress on that today."Secondly, we are seeking to have these temporary pauses to allow humanitarian aid in and to get our people out."Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

04/11/2023 20:10:00	Israel-Gaza war: Ceasefire would allow Hamas to regroup, says Blinken - BBC News	US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said an Israeli ceasefire in Gaza would allow Hamas to regroup and carry out further attacks.But he added that Israel had to take "every possible measure" to prevent civilian casualties in the enclave.Mr Blinken made the comments on Saturday in Jordan after holding talks with Arab leaders, who want an immediate halt to the fighting. They have accused Israel of committing war crimes. "We don't accept that it is a self-defence," Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said at a news conference with Mr Blinken following the talks, which also involved Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. The US continues to support Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas.Mr Safadi described the conflict as a "raging war that is killing civilians, destroying their homes, their hospitals, their schools, their mosques and their churches.""It cannot be justified under any pretext and it will not bring Israel security, it will not bring the region peace."There have been concerns that the war could draw in other regional actors and lead to the destabilisation of the Middle East.Mr Blinken, who has been calling for humanitarian pauses in the fighting instead of a ceasefire, said that while the US disagreed with Arab leaders on some of the means to achieve a lasting peace in the region, their goal was the same. "We all understand that we not only have an interest, but a responsibility to do everything we can to chart a better path forward together," he said. Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel in surprise attacks on 7 October. More than 200 people were kidnapped and the majority are still thought to be being held as hostages.At least 9,488 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Mr Blinken's trip to Jordan comes a day after he visited Israel to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said there would be no humanitarian pause until all Israeli hostages are released.The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) has been focusing its offensive in the northern part of Gaza, following repeated warnings for civilians to leave.As many as 400,000 civilians are still in the area, according to the US special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues, David Satterfield.The IDF has also been carrying out strikes in the south and the United Nations has warned no part of Gaza is safe. Mr Blinken spoke on Saturday of the need to dramatically increase the amount of aid that was getting into the enclave through Egypt's Rafah crossing. Only limited deliveries are currently making their way into Gaza, weeks after Israel announced a siege - cutting off supplies of power, food and water.The US Secretary of State has also met Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, to discuss the violence along Lebanon's southern border with Israel, where there has been frequent fighting between members of the Shia Islamist group Hezbollah and the Israeli military. The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, has so far refrained from calling for an escalation of attacks against Israel, but has left the door open for further action. Mr Blinken will travel to Turkey on Sunday for two days to speak with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about the conflict. The visit comes after Ankara recalled its ambassador to Israel and broke contact with Mr Netanyahu in protest against the bloodshed. 	
04/11/2023 20:01:00	Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt fails to open for foreigners - BBC News	The exit of foreigners from Gaza via the Rafah border crossing was halted on Saturday in an apparent dispute over evacuating injured patients.Hundreds of foreign citizens have escaped through the crossing into Egypt in the past few days.But on Saturday, no foreign nationals, dual nationals or injured patients were let through, Palestinian sources said.Hundreds of people with foreign passports went to the border, but the gate did not open.Sources from the crossing authorities on the Palestinian side told the BBC that movement of people with foreign passports is not being allowed until there is agreement on the safety of transferring injured patients.There has been no official statement from the authorities as yet.The UK Foreign Office confirmed that British citizens in Gaza had been unable to leave via the Rafah crossing.A spokesperson told the BBC: "We are disappointed that the Rafah crossing has been temporarily closed today."This continues to be a complex and challenging situation and we are using all diplomatic channels to press for its reopening in coordination with our international partners."The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened on Wednesday to allow a number of civilians to leave Gaza.It was their first opportunity to do so since the war began on 7 October, when Hamas gunmen staged an unprecedented assault on southern Israel that killed more than 1,400 people.Since then, the Israeli military has launched a massive bombing campaign on Gaza, placed the strip under a "complete siege" and recently launched a ground assault on the north of Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 9,488 people have been killed.Rafah is the southernmost post of exit from Gaza and borders Egypt's Sinai peninsula.Mohammed Ghalayini, a British scientist from Manchester who had been in Gaza visiting family when the war began, accompanied his uncle to the crossing earlier this week after he was named by Gaza authorities on the list of approved evacuees.   "People are really afraid of what's going on and so if they have a chance to leave, they're trying to leave," he told the BBC.    "But getting to the border is a struggle as well, because fuel supplies are short," he added. "So you know, I saw people arriving on a donkey cart with their luggage at the border."The crossing, which has been open and shut frequently over the years, is now also the only crossing point for humanitarian aid.Israel has not allowed any fuel shipments to enter the Strip since the start of the war. It has also cut off electricity supplies, prompting calls from UN agencies for fuel supplies to be let into Gaza to power basic services.But on Saturday, US special envoy David Satterfield told reporters that when the fuel runs out in Gaza, there is an agreed mechanism to bring more in.On Friday, an ambulance that had been attempting to transport an injured person to the Rafah border crossing was hit outside Gaza City's biggest hospital, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. The agency says 15 people were killed in the incident.The Israeli military said a number of Hamas fighters had been killed and accused Hamas - which is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US, UK and other powers - of transferring militants and weapons in ambulances, although it has not yet supplied evidence of this.Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

04/11/2023 10:18:00	Red Crescent says 15 killed in strike on Gaza ambulance outside Al-Shifa hospital - BBC News	The Palestinian Red Crescent says at least 15 people have been killed in an Israeli strike on an ambulance outside Gaza City's biggest hospital.BBC Verify has verified graphic videos showing badly injured and possibly dead people lying outside the Al-Shifa hospital.The Israeli military has confirmed it struck an ambulance that it says was being used by Hamas operatives.It did not say where the air strike took place."An IDF aircraft struck an ambulance that was identified by forces as being used by a Hamas terrorist cell in close proximity to their position in the battle zone," it said in a statement.It said a number of Hamas fighters had been killed and accused Hamas of transferring militants and weapons in ambulances, but has not yet supplied evidence of this. "We emphasise that this area is a battle zone. Civilians in the area are repeatedly called upon to evacuate southwards for their own safety," it added.Earlier, the Hamas-run health ministry said 13 people were killed in a blast outside Al-Shifa.In a statement posted on X (formerly Twitter), the Palestinian Red Crescent said "the deliberate targeting of medical teams constitutes a grave violation of the Geneva Conventions, a war crime". BBC Verify studied three videos - one of which is very graphic - and established that they were filmed outside the hospital and were uploaded on Friday afternoon.In one video, people were filmed lying in pools of blood in the road next to vehicles - some were severely injured and some were not moving.There is no crater visible in the footage we've seen so far, and no debris or shrapnel visible. There's damage to the front of an ambulance and some cars on the road have smashed windows.In its statement, the Palestinian Red Crescent said the convoy was struck twice on its way to the Al-Shifa hospital - once 1km (0.62 miles) away and a second time outside the hospital gate, where it said it had arrived to unload patients.A Hamas government statement said Israeli forces targeted "a convoy of ambulances which was transporting the wounded" from Al-Shifa hospital Gaza City towards Rafah in the south. Egypt's health ministry said just 17 wounded Palestinians were evacuated for treatment in Egyptian hospitals on Friday instead of the 28 originally planned because of the "events" at Al-Shifa.The head of the World Health Organization said he was "utterly shocked" by the explosion at Al-Shifa."We reiterate: patients, health workers, facilities and ambulances must be protected at all times. Always," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X. Bisan Owda, a Palestinian filmmaker, was nearby when the attack happened."Some people lost their legs, lost their hands, people were trying to carry injuries," she told the BBC. "People were crying, trying to find each other."In addition to the patients at Al-Shifa, thousands more people are sheltering from Israeli air strikes there.Ms Owda said many were unable to find space inside the hospital and were sleeping in nearby streets,.The Israeli military says there is a major Hamas headquarters situated underneath the hospital.In a separate incident in Gaza City on Friday, Gaza health officials said several people were killed and wounded in an Israeli strike on a school where hundreds were taking shelter. Israel has not yet commented.Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 240 others.It has also launched a ground operation and on Thursday said its forces had encircled Gaza City.Israel has warned people to move to the south of the Gaza Strip and hundreds of thousands have left Gaza City and northern areas. But many thousands remain in northern Gaza.Continued Israeli air strikes in the southern Gaza Strip, where Israel had told Gazans to go, as well as overcrowded conditions there have prompted some Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza,The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since 7 October.	
04/11/2023 04:50:00	Rafah crossing: More Britons leave after nearly 100 listed as eligible - BBC News	More British citizens have begun to leave the Gaza Strip, after Palestinian authorities listed nearly 100 as being eligible to cross to Egypt on Friday.The UK section of the Palestinian border authority list names more than 90 people as British nationals.Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said "a number" of Britons were leaving Gaza, a development he described as "positive news". Mr Cleverly did not provide a figure for how many have left. He added the UK "will continue to work with" authorities in the region to ensure as many Britons "as possible" can leave Gaza. The BBC is aware of at least 19 people named on the list who are unable to leave via the Rafah crossing. Three family groups have said they are located in the north of Gaza but it is too dangerous to travel to the south where the crossing is located.The parents-in-law of Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf, trapped in Gaza since 7 October, have left, but said they were "severely traumatised".Among the first to arrive back in the UK was Dr Abdelkader Hammad, a surgeon in Liverpool, who said it was a "big, big relief" to walk through the doors at Heathrow on Friday evening and see his family."It has been four weeks waiting for this moment really to happen, and, I mean at some stage I wasn't sure this would happen really," he said,"but thanks god I am here."He said whole neighbourhoods in Gaza had been levelled and said you could "smell death", with many bodies still under the rubble.Border crossings in and out of Gaza have been closed since 7 October, when Hamas, which is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK, attacked Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostage.Since then, the Israeli military has launched a massive bombing campaign on Gaza, placed the strip under a "complete siege" and recently launched a ground assault on the north of Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed. Mr Cleverly said his office had not been informed of any British nationals killed in Gaza, but that the flow of information was often interrupted, delayed, or contradictory information was received. About 200 British nationals were believed to be in Gaza before war broke out.A small number have already left Gaza after some foreign nationals and injured Palestinian people began to be allowed to go through the crossing into Egypt for the first time from Wednesday. Ibrahim Assalia, a British national who travelled to Gaza with his wife and children three months ago after his father was diagnosed with cancer, was on Friday's list but could not get to Rafah.He said his family is unable to get to the border, as Israeli tanks have cut off the routes to the Rafah crossing and are "shelling every civilian car that passes through". Mr Assalia told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme a family of 10 people was killed on Thursday trying to get to the border, adding: "We don't sleep, the kids cry. We hate every minute."  The Foreign Office has said it does not comment on individual cases, but added it is working at "every level of government to ensure British nationals can leave".The Israeli military is yet to respond to the BBC on claims civilians are being fired upon, but has previously said it does not target civilians.The UK section of the list published by Palestinian authorities contains 127 names, with 92 listed as being British nationals. But it is not clear if the others, the vast majority of whom are described as Palestinian, also hold dual citizenship.Humza Yousaf's parents-in-law Elizabeth and Maged El-Nakla, who live in Dundee, have made it to Egypt after becoming trapped in Gaza while visiting relatives before the borders closed.In a statement on Friday, the first minister and his wife Nadia confirmed her parents had left and expressed gratitude to people who have helped them, including the Foreign Office crisis team."These last four weeks have been a living nightmare for our family, we are so thankful for all of the messages of comfort and prayers that we have received from across the world, and indeed from across the political spectrum in Scotland and the UK," they said.Speaking on Friday, security minister Tom Tugendhat said the British government was being "very cautious" about giving an exact number of people who will be able to get out because "we neither control the border, nor do we control what's going on inside Gaza"."So what we don't want to do is give false hope or false belief to individuals that they'll be able to cross today," he told BBC Breakfast.The UK has deployed a Border Force team in Cairo, as well as consular officials in Arish, near Rafah, to provide support for UK nationals after leaving Gaza.Surgeon Abdelkadar Hammad, who lives in Liverpool, was among those who were able to exit via the Rafah crossing into Egypt  on Thursday, his family have said. Downing Street previously confirmed that two UK aid workers were among those to make it through Rafah, which is the only Gazan border crossing not controlled by Israel.More on Israel-Gaza war On Thursday, the Foreign Office said more British nationals had managed to pass through the Gaza-Egypt border, but did not confirm how many.A dual UK-US citizen who left Gaza on Thursday with her family has told the BBC an exception was made for her British-Palestinian husband at the border as he was with family on the list of US citizens eligible to leave. Dr Emilee Rauschenberger, an academic who lives in Salford, described the situation at Rafah as chaotic, with many people struggling to make it to the far-south of Gaza without cars or access to other transport. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday there was no system to divide people who were eligible to leave and those not on a list but hoping to cross, creating a stressful situation.After waiting many hours on the Gazan side of the border crossing, the family made it through to Egypt where they were given food and water and seen by medical staff.Dr Rauschenberger said British embassy staff in Egypt told her about 10 British citizens, who she believes work for aid agencies or other international organisations, also crossed on Thursday.The UK government has given both the Israeli and Egyptian authorities a list of British citizens and their dependants, prioritised by their medical vulnerability.Dr Ahmed Abou Foul, who is based in Birmingham, has told the BBC that 16 members of his family who are trying to leave Gaza are on the list, including eight children. He says he has mixed feelings about the news because two young children and their mothers, his sisters-in-law, will not be be able to leave as their names are not on the list.Dr Abou Foul told BBC Breakfast on Friday the family do not know why they have been excluded, as he said they had been given assurances from the Foreign Office.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.	
04/11/2023 00:36:00	Conservative MP Bob Stewart guilty of racially aggravated public order offence - BBC News	A Conservative MP who told an activist to "go back to Bahrain" has been found guilty of a racially aggravated public order offence and fined £600.Bob Stewart, MP for Beckenham in south-east London, got into a row with Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei outside the Foreign Office's Lancaster House in Westminster on 14 December.He told Mr Alwadaei: "You're taking money off my country, go away."Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for him to lose the Tory whip.Westminster Magistrates' Court heard the 74-year-old had been attending an event hosted by the Bahraini Embassy when Mr Alwadaei, the director of advocacy at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, shouted: "Bob Stewart, for how much did you sell yourself to the Bahraini regime?"Stewart replied: "Go away, I hate you. You make a lot of fuss. Go back to Bahrain."Mr Alwadaei challenged Stewart on his connections with the country, asking repeatedly whether he had accepted any money from the Bahraini government. The MP, who was stationed in Bahrain as an Army officer in the 1960s, told the campaigner to "get stuffed" and added: "Bahrain's a great place. End of."In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Alwadaei said: "No-one should think twice about holding an MP or members of the government to account because of their skin colour."When I reported Mr Stewart to the Conservative Party, they didn't take action against him and when he was charged, they refused to suspend him."Given today's verdict, I expect them to take immediate action."Paul Jarvis, prosecuting, told the court: "Mr Alwadaei felt upset and humiliated by what had taken place."He added: "He (Stewart) demonstrated racial hostility towards Mr Alwadaei by way of his comments."However, the prosecutor said Stewart "was not motivated by racial hostility".Stewart's defence, Paul Cavin KC, had argued: "There is no right to confront an MP in public and expect answers in a measured House of Commons way."He added: "Any hostility was based on the complainant's behaviour, conduct and speech towards the defendant." Baroness Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, 90, giving character evidence, said "kind" and "thoughtful" Stewart has a "flippant" manner, adding: "He is given to saying things that are unwise but his heart is absolutely in the right place."Asked for his thoughts on the allegations of racial hostility, Stewart said: "That's absurd, it's totally unfair. My life has been, I don't want to say destroyed, but I am deeply hurt at having to appear in a court like this."I am not a racist. He was saying that I was corrupt and that I had taken money."My honour was at stake in front of a large number of ambassadors."Speaking after the guilty verdict, opposition parties, called for the Conservative whip to be removed from Mr Stewart, meaning he would need to sit as an independent MP.Labour chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said it was "yet another serious Conservative scandal"."This behaviour is totally unacceptable for a sitting MP. Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party need to immediately take action, and remove the Conservative whip," she said.Liberal Democrat chief whip Wendy Chamberlain said: "It's time Sunak finally acted with integrity. This should start with immediately removing the whip from Bob Stewart. "Failing to remove the whip sends a dangerous message that behaviour like this is acceptable."The Conservative Party said it was not commenting at the moment.Parliamentary records show Stewart registered flights, accommodation and meals worth £5,349 during a four-day trip to Bahrain last November paid for by its ministry of foreign affairs.A separate entry covered by the Bahraini government shows another trip, worth £1,245.56, to visit an air show and meet its foreign minister.Mr Alwadaei alleged the country is "corrupt" and a "human rights violator".Claire Walsh, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor of the CPS, said: "His claim that his words were misinterpreted was rejected by the court in light of evidence presented by the CPS, including footage filmed by a witness and the victim's testimony."Hatred of any kind has no place in society and wherever our legal test is met, the CPS will not hesitate to prosecute those who perpetrate hate crimes."The MP was also ordered to pay legal costs of £835.His £600 fine would have been £400 had it not been for the seriousness of the hate crime he committed, the CPS said.Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

04/11/2023 00:11:00	Israel rebuffs Blinken's call for Gaza humanitarian pause - BBC News	Israel has rebuffed US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's call for a "humanitarian pause" in Gaza. Mr Blinken said he had discussed the idea with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials during their talks in Tel Aviv.But in a TV statement minutes later, Mr Netanyahu said Israel rejected "a temporary ceasefire that does not include the release of our hostages".He said that Israel was "continuing with all our force" against Hamas.The US diplomatic effort came as Israeli military commanders said their forces had encircled Gaza City and were engaged in a "complex urban fight". Israel's offensive - involving air strikes and ground forces - was launched in the aftermath of the attack on 7 October during which Hamas fighters killed 1,400 people in Israel and and took more than 240 hostages.Israel's assault has killed at least 9,200 people in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.In his visit to Tel Aviv, Mr Blinken offered a message of continued US support and sought assurances that Israel would take "concrete steps" to protect Palestinian civilians."A number of legitimate questions were raised in our discussions today, including how to use any period of pause to maximise the flow of humanitarian assistance, how to connect the pause to the release of hostages, how to ensure that Hamas doesn't use these pauses or arrangements to its own advantage," Mr Blinken told a news conference.He noted that more than 100 aid trucks had entered Gaza in the past 24 hours, where none were permitted until recently, but said this was still not enough.Mr Blinken, on his second trip to the region in a month, said the US had provided Israel advice on how to minimise civilian deaths while still trying to "finish" Hamas. And he said he had discussed tangible steps on allowing more aid, including fuel, to reach Gaza.But Mr Netanyahu was adamant he would not allow any fuel into the Gaza Strip. He has also rejected all talk of a ceasefire."Israel is refusing a temporary truce that doesn't include the release of our hostages," the Israeli PM said.The US secretary of state also argued that Israel would only gain security through the creation of a Palestinian state.Reiterating longstanding US policy on a two-state solution, he said: "Two states for two peoples. Again, that is the only way to ensure lasting security for a Jewish and democratic Israel."In comments made at a news conference beside the Israeli President Isaac Herzog, Mr Blinken said Israel "has the right and obligation to defend itself and to ensure the events of 7 October never happen again".Mr Herzog said Israel was going to great lengths to warn Gazans of airstrikes, as he held up a pamphlet that he said was being dropped in the Strip telling civilians to leave the war zone in the north.As the two men spoke, protesters could be heard shouting on a loudspeaker from a nearby street - families of Israelis who had been taken hostage. Mr Herzog said that his "heart goes out to them", while Mr Blinken added that the US was thinking "every single moment of our hostages"."So many, both Israelis, Americans, other nationals - and we're determined to do everything we can to bring them back safely to be with their families and loved ones," he added.White House officials later held a conference call with reporters and said Hamas had been blocking foreign nationals from leaving Gaza.Any hope of freeing the hostages would take "a very significant pause" in the Israeli offensive, one of the officials said.Illustrating the political pressure Mr Biden faces from the left-wing of his party, one Democratic representative launched a blistering attack on him on Friday.Rashida Tlaib - a Michigan congresswoman who is the only US lawmaker of Palestinian descent - accused the president of having "supported the genocide of the Palestinian people" in his refusal to demand a ceasefire."Support a ceasefire now or don't count on us in 2024," she added, referring to his re-election campaign. The US secretary of state is now in Jordan, which earlier this week recalled its ambassador from Israel. On Saturday, America's top diplomat will meet Arab leaders who have become increasingly outspoken in their criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza.	
03/11/2023 22:29:00	Hezbollah steps back from all-out war on Israel over Gaza - for now - BBC News	The Hezbollah leader took his time to respond to the past month of bloodletting which has turned the Middle East into a tinder box.  And when Hassan Nasrallah spoke, what he did not say was as important as what he said. There was no declaration of all-out war on Israel. At least, not now.Few in Lebanon had expected one. Nasrallah knows there is little appetite in this country for another war with its powerful neighbour. The last one was in 2006. Lebanese have troubles enough, with a shattered economy and a bankrupt political system. That is a powerful deterrent, along with the two American aircraft carriers recently deployed to the eastern Mediterranean.Hassan Nasrallah addressed the segregated rally - thousands strong - by video link from an undisclosed location.  It was not just his supporters who were hanging on his every word. His speech was required listening in Tel Aviv and in Washington. What Hezbollah does - or does not do - could be crucial now. The Hezbollah leader declared that "all options are open," adding that "the situation could escalate militarily at any time".  That would depend, he said, on Israel's actions in Gaza, and its approach towards Lebanon.Hezbollah is already stepping up the pressure on Israel with an escalation in cross-border attacks, which has forced the Israeli army to divert troops to the area.  But Hamas wants more from its ally.At times, the fiery cleric sounded almost defensive about what his fighters have done so far."What's taking place on our front is very important and significant," he said. "Those who claim that Hezbollah should engage swiftly in an all-out war with the enemy might see what is taking place on the border as minimal. But if look objectively, we will find it sizeable."He said 57 Hezbollah fighters had been killed in recent weeks.Predictably, he left the door open for a further escalation. "I assure you this will not be the end," he said, "this will not be sufficient."Hassan Nasrallah insisted that the 7 October attacks by Hamas were a "100% Palestinian operation", carried out in great secrecy, concealed even from Hamas's allies.  "It has no relation to any regional or international issues," he said, in effect claiming he did not know and neither did Iran.Crowds chanted, "We are with you Nasrallah" as they waited under a hot sun at a rally in southern suburbs of Beirut. On a rooftop overlooking the gathering, a masked man kept watch, with a bulky jamming device to block drones. This is Hezbollah heartland, where many are devoted to the Islamist group, which - like Hamas - is classed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and the US, and many other governments."I don't think he [Nasrallah] is going to bring war to the whole country," said Fatima, a 17-year-old journalism student with gold rimmed glasses, "but whatever he decides, I am fine with it. If it is war, I am not afraid. I don't think there is anything better than dying for a good cause.  We are standing with our Palestinian brothers and sisters."The indications are that Hezbollah plans to leave the war in Gaza to Hamas, for now. But that calculus could change quickly if Hamas comes close to defeat. If Israel achieves a victory in Gaza, the cost could be a much bigger war -  with Hezbollah.	
03/11/2023 22:23:00	Gaza: 'My wife died in five minutes, she was my life' - BBC News	A man who grew up in Belfast has returned to Ireland after his wife and other family members were killed in Gaza.Khalid El-Estal, 30, said he had been working in Saudi Arabia while his family remained in the Palestinian territory.Gaza has been bombed by Israel as part of its conflict with Hamas.Mr El-Estal said he had "lost everything" but is hoping his two young children can join him in Dublin."I want to take them out, I want word from the government. They are Irish," he told Irish broadcaster RTÉ on Friday.His children, aged one and four, remain in Gaza with their grandparents, he said.He added he feared for their lives without assistance from the Irish authorities. Mr El-Estal was born in Belfast and attended primary school in the Botanic area while his father worked as a lecturer at Queen's University.When he was aged eight, the family relocated to Gaza, where Khalid met his wife, Ashwak Jendia, at university."She was my life," he said. As violence in the region escalated last week, Mr El-Estal explained he urged his wife to move south and stay with his relatives, while he contacted Irish officials to seek help."The exact day she [arrived] in my family's place they bombed the place," Mr El-Estal said.The bomb killed his mother and brother "immediately", he added.He continued that his uncle, and his uncle's two daughters - both doctors - were also killed in the blast, and both of Khalid's children were buried in rubble. Ashwak was taken to hospital, eventually dying from her injuries, which included 60% burns to her body, he detailed."It's killing me," he said. "I lost everything, it's not only me, I am better than a lot of people in Gaza," Mr El-Estal said.Now, he said he cannot bring himself to tell his children that their mother has died. Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200 others.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 9,000 people had been killed in the Strip since 7 October.In a statement, an Irish Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said more than 8,000 foreign and dual nationals are in Gaza.This includes thousands of dependent children who are entitled to dual citizenship in various countries.However, the spokesperson said evacuations will take some time to complete."Time? Time means death. My wife died in five minutes," Mr El-Estal told RTÉ.	
03/11/2023 21:48:00	Pentagon acknowledges flying unarmed drones over Gaza - BBC News	The US has confirmed for the first time that it has been flying unarmed surveillance drones over Gaza.Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder said the drones were operating in "support of hostage recovery efforts"."These UAV flights began after the Oct 7 attack by Hamas on Israel," he said in a brief statement.The acknowledgement comes after reporters spotted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) on flight-tracking websites.  "The US is conducting unarmed UAV flights over Gaza, as well as providing advice and assistance to support our Israeli partner as they work on their hostage recovery efforts," the Pentagon's statement on Friday said.The confirmation comes after reporters spotted MQ-9 Reapers, usually operated by American special forces, circling Gaza on Flightradar24, a publicly available flight-tracking website.Reaper drones have previously been deployed to conduct airstrikes in Afghanistan, but are primarily used as surveillance aircraft because of their ability to "loiter" above an area for more than 20 hours at a time.Unnamed US military officials told the New York Times that the drones were not helping co-ordinate Israeli military action in and around Gaza. Officials told the newspaper that information related to hostage recovery was being passed on to the Israelis.These are not the only remote-controlled American military vehicles operating in the region.On Thursday, the US Navy announced that it had fired lethal munitions from an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) - a speed boat - in the international waters of the Arabian Sea.In a statement, the Navy noted that the test on 23 October was the first time combat munitions had been fired from a USV in the Middle East. The US Navy said the development brings American military capabilities in the region to the "next level".Last month, the US Navy said it had shot down multiple drones and rockets fired from Yemen that were appearing to head towards Israel.The US has also sent two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean, saying that they are there to prevent the war between Hamas and Israel from spreading.In a fiery speech on Friday, the leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah warned the US against using the ships to attack the militant group."Your fleets in the Mediterranean do not scare us and will never scare us," said Hassan Nasrallah.

03/11/2023 18:20:00	Sinn Féin call for Israeli ambassador to Ireland to be expelled - BBC News	Israel's ambassador to Ireland should be expelled until a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is imposed, Sinn Féin has said.The party has changed its stance after previously stopping short of calling for the measure.Sinn Féin had faced some criticism over its position, including from the SDLP and People Before Profit.On Friday, party president Mary Lou McDonald said the deepening scale of the crisis means sanctions are needed.Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said there will be no temporary ceasefire until Israeli hostages are released from Gaza. Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200 others on 7 October.The Hamas-run health ministry has said more than 9,000 people have subsequently been killed in Gaza."Our approach has been ceasefire from the get-go and we're not outliers in that regard," Mrs McDonald said. "That is the international law which remains our priority but as Israel turns its face away from that call for ceasefire, as the crisis deepens and the violence becomes all the more intense, clearly, there has to be a consequence here in Ireland.""The Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) and the government, we believe, have to follow that logic now of their own assessment, which is that Israel is not acting now purely in self-defence, and they are inflicting collective punishment on an innocent civilian population."Sinn Féin said the Israeli ambassador, Dana Erlich, should "no longer enjoy diplomatic status in Ireland" until a ceasefire is announced.The party's youth wing had already called for the ambassador to be expelled last month, after an attack at a hospital in Gaza.Last week, the Irish government said there were no plans to expel the ambassador with Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar saying it was important to have "some line of communications open".Speaking to reporters on a trip to South Korea on Friday, Mr Varadkar said what is happening in Gaza is not just self-defence on the part of Israel, but it "resembles something more approaching revenge".His comments come as Israeli ground troops began encircling Gaza City on Friday morning.He said it is very important that people "never forget where this started", adding this phase of the conflict started with a Hamas attack on Israel where 1,400 civilians were killed. "I strongly believe, like any state, Israel has a right to defend itself, has the right to go after Hamas, so they cannot do this again," Mr Varadkar said."But what I am seeing unfolding at the moment isn't just self-defence, it resembles something more approaching revenge and that's not where we should be and I don't think it is how Israel will guarantee its future freedom and security."Ms Erlich herself was criticised last month, after making comments about Ireland's President Michael D Higgins. She had also questioned Ireland's neutrality, telling the Sunday Independent newspaper there was "a strong feeling in Israel that there is an unconscious bias against Israel in Ireland".	
03/11/2023 18:05:00	Humza Yousaf's relief as family cross Gaza border to safety - BBC News	Humza Yousaf said his family was "highly relieved" that his in-laws have left Gaza after being trapped in the territory for more than three weeks.The first minister's parents-in-law had been unable to leave following the deadly attacks on Israel by Hamas. Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband Maged - the parents of Mr Yousaf's wife Nadia - had been visiting relatives.Ms El-Nakla said they were "completely exhausted" after entering Egypt through the Rafah crossing.They were among a number of British nationals who have begun to leave the Gaza Strip, after Palestinian authorities listed nearly 100 as being eligible.Mr Yousaf said his family shed tears when they heard the news on Friday.He also recalled the special moment he phoned his 14-year-old daughter on her school break to tell her: "Granny and Grandad are coming home". But the first minister admitted the experience of being trapped in a warzone had left the couple "severely traumatised" and warned it would take them some time to recover. Mr Yousaf said his wife was "so happy" to hear that her parents had crossed over the border.He said: "You can imagine how many tears have been shed by us just this morning, let alone over the last four weeks."But her worry immediately transfers from her mother and father to now her brother, to her granny, to her step mum, to her nephews and niece, and to all those innocent men, women and children who are suffering not a natural disaster but a man-made conflict."The first minister said his thoughts were with all those affected by the war and renewed his calls for a ceasefire.  Mr and Mrs El-Nakla, from Dundee, had spent the past two weeks in a house where 100 people were sheltering, including a child of two months old.They had travelled to the border on three previous occasions without success.Speaking to BBC News from a coach bound for Cairo, Ms El-Nakla said: "We are completely exhausted as we haven't slept properly for the past 27 days. "The past few days have been particularly traumatic. "We don't really know what's been going on in the outside world as there's been no internet, electricity, clean water and food has been difficult to get."The couple travelled to Gaza early last month to visit Mr El-Naka's mother, who had a stroke in March but has now recovered. They were planning on staying for five weeks but just four days into their trip Hamas launched a deadly assault on Israel.Ms El-Nakla said that leaving her relatives behind had been "incredibly hard".Mr Yousaf's wife's brother - a doctor in a Gaza hospital - and his family all remain in Gaza, as do her stepmother and grandmother. They are not UK passport holders and were therefore unable to leave.The Rafah crossing, which offers the only way in and out of Gaza, was opened by Egypt on Wednesday.A list published overnight by the Palestinian Border Authority said those named must be "present at 07:00 in the outdoor halls of the crossing to facilitate their travel". Injured Palestinians and 335 foreign passport holders, including some British nationals, were the first to be allowed to cross. A statement from Mr Yousaf and Ms El-Nakla confirmed the couple had made it safely through the crossing on Friday morning.They expressed gratitude to everyone who had assisted the couple, including the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office crisis team.The statement added: "These last four weeks have been a living nightmare for our family, we are so thankful for all of the messages of comfort and prayers that we have received from across the world, and indeed from across the political spectrum in Scotland and the UK."Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: "This is great news for Humza Yousaf and his wife Nadia. I'm delighted that their family are safe after weeks of anguish and uncertainty. "The El-Naklas were among about 200 British nationals believed to have been trapped in Gaza. Routes in and out of the region were closed after Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group in the UK - attacked Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostage.Since then, the Israeli military has launched a massive bombing campaign on Gaza, placed the strip under a "complete siege" and launched a ground assault on the north of the territory. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed.Earlier this week Mr Yousaf said he did not know whether his family was alive or dead in Gaza, as it was under a communications blackout.Ms El-Nakla said her parents had been without clean drinking water and faced "rapidly diminishing supplies".Mr Yousaf spoke to the BBC of his feelings of "helplessness and distress" at not being able to do more to get his family home and shared a video of his mother-in-law describing the conditions they were living under in Gaza.	
03/11/2023 15:48:00	Canadians stuck in Gaza as other foreigners leave - BBC News	Hundreds of Canadians remain trapped in Gaza as foreign nationals from other countries have been able to cross into Egypt. No Canadian was on the latest list published by Gaza border authorities of those approved to leave on Friday.One family said they received a call from Canadian officials to be ready at a moment's notice, but have not yet been informed on when they could leave.Canada has registered about 450 of its citizens who want to leave Gaza.So far, dozens of Americans have been able to leave in the last three days. People from other countries, including Britain, Sri Lanka, Mexico and European nationals have either left or are on the approved list to leave. Dozens of seriously injured Palestinians were also allowed to cross into Egypt since Wednesday. One Canadian has managed to leave Gaza, who was reportedly able to exit "with a third party", although the government declined to give details, citing privacy considerations.The BBC understands there are about 7,000 dual nationals in Gaza.In an update on social media late Thursday evening, Canada's foreign affairs minister Melanie Joly said she spoke to her Israeli counterpart, Eli Cohen, and was reassured that Canadians would be able to leave "in the coming days". "My Egyptian counterpart confirmed their cooperation," Ms Joly said. "Global Affairs Canada will communicate the latest information directly with Canadians."The lists of those allowed to cross is agreed upon between Egypt and Israel, with embassies from the relevant countries being informed in advance to ensure they can prepare to receive their citizens, Western officials have said.In total, Canada has provided authorities in the region with a list of about 450 eligible citizens, permanent residents and family members who want to leave the embattled territory. It is one of the largest contingents of foreign nationals in Gaza, Canadian officials said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was questioned on Thursday on why Canadians had not yet received approval to leave. "Obviously, the Rafah crossing is an extremely complicated place right now," Mr Trudeau said. "We're pushing on our friends in Israel and our friends in Egypt, working with Americans and others, to make sure that the Canadian families get on the list," he said.One Canadian family in Gaza told the Canadian Press that they received a call from officials on Thursday telling them to gather their documents to prepare to leave, but they were not given a date or time. Mahmoud Nasser said he and his family - including his pregnant wife - were sheltering at a refugee camp, a 20-minute ride away from the Rafah border crossing. "It's kind of a dilemma for all of us," he said. "We're not sure what to do with this situation."He was told that a bus would be waiting for Canadians and their families on the Egyptian side once they were allowed to cross. Others say they have received no word yet from Global Affairs Canada.A spokeswoman for a Palestinian Canadian group that met Mr Trudeau this week told the BBC that many are feeling "very upset and frustrated" that the Canadian government has been unsuccessful in securing safe passage for its trapped citizenReem Sultan said that - in contrast to the government's official statements - some Canadian friends and acquaintances of hers in Gaza have not yet been contacted by officials. She said that some families with relatives in Gaza believe they "are being treated differently" than Canadian citizens who were evacuated from Tel Aviv in the early stages of the war.According to the Canadian Air Force, more than 1,600 Canadians were flown out of Israel on 19 separate flights by military aircraft, with the last flight taking off on 23 October. "Now, we're not putting on enough pressure to get our citizens out...many are feeling as though they are not as important," she said. "This is the part that is very confusing and frustrating for families." Canadians in Gaza have reported that they are facing mounting humanitarian issues, including shortages of fuel, lack of food, and contaminated water amid heavy airstrikes and bombardment from Israeli aircraft and artillery. "Every minute that passes, people die," she said. "Our families are at risk of dying at any moment."The group also demanded that Canada call for an immediate ceasefire in the war and a humanitarian corridor to allow food, water and fuel to be shipped into Gaza. Canada, along with the US, the UK, and EU, has stopped short of calling for a ceasefire, instead pushing for a humanitarian "pause" in the conflict. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed in the Strip since the beginning of the war.Six Canadians were killed when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking 242 hostages.At least two Canadians are still reported missing.	
03/11/2023 15:30:00	Palestinian workers return to Gaza after expulsion from Israel - BBC News	Crowds of workers from Gaza have been returning to the Palestinian territory after Israel expelled thousands of them and vowed to refuse any new permits. Gaza is facing constant bombardment and acute shortages of key supplies.The UN voiced its concerns for the workers' safety in the "incredibly difficult and dangerous situation".Before the war, more than 18,000 Palestinian workers were allowed to cross from Gaza into Israel and the occupied West Bank.Israel suspects Hamas, which runs Gaza, may have got information about the places it attacked on 7 October from Gazans working on the kibbutzes.Israeli media reports quote intelligence sources who suggest that the layouts of individual homes in these communities - and the proximity of Israeli defences - were among details that might have been passed on.The unprecedented assault on southern Israel by Hamas almost four weeks ago killed more than 1,400 people. The Israeli military says that 242 others were abducted and are being held hostage in Gaza.In the wake of the attack, Israel launched an aerial campaign campaign and ground offensive in the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian enclave. The Gazan health ministry, run by Hamas, says more than 9,000 people have been killed. The crossings to Gaza were also closed as Israel stepped up its blockade, which has left Palestinian labourers stranded in Israel for weeks.Announcing the expulsion of workers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu restated his aim to cut all ties with Gaza.A post on X, formerly known as Twitter, from his office went on to say: "There will be no more Palestinian workers from Gaza. Those workers from Gaza who were in Israel on the day of the outbreak of the war will be returned to Gaza."Israeli officials have not said how many of these people were in Israel on the day Hamas launched its deadly attacks.The jobs held by the Gazans - in sectors like agriculture or construction - commanded salaries up to 10 times what a worker could earn in Gaza, according to the Reuters news agency. Crowds of men were pictured on Friday using the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel into Gaza, which is normally used for goods only. The checkpoint is east of the Rafah border crossing - between Gaza and Egypt - through which a limited number of people have been able to leave Gaza since Wednesday.Some of those who spoke to Reuters at Kerem Shalom said they had been detained and mistreated by Israeli authorities after the Hamas attacks.The UN's human rights office said it was "deeply concerned" that "at least 4,000 Palestinian workers and hospital patients were detained without sufficient legal basis" when Israel revoked their work permits after the events of 7 October.The BBC has approached Israeli authorities for comment on the alleged mistreatment of Gazan workers in detention.A UN spokeswoman also said it was "worrying" that some Palestinians were being sent back to Gaza "despite the gravity of the situation there". She said it was not clear whether some of the affected people even had a home to return to.	
03/11/2023 15:20:00	What is Hezbollah in Lebanon and will it go to war with Israel? - BBC News	Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Islamist group Hezbollah, has praised the Hamas attacks on Israel in his first speech about the war.Over the past month, Hezbollah has frequently targeted Israeli armour and military positions from across the border in Lebanon. Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim organisation which is politically influential and in control of the most powerful armed force in Lebanon.It was established in the early 1980s by the region's most dominant Shia power, Iran, to oppose Israel. At the time, Israel's forces had occupied southern Lebanon, during the country's civil war. Hezbollah has participated in national elections since 1992 and has become a major political presence.Its armed wing has carried out deadly attacks on Israeli and US forces in Lebanon. When Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah took credit for pushing them out.Since then, Hezbollah has maintained thousands of fighters and a huge missile arsenal in southern Lebanon. It continues to oppose Israel's presence in disputed border areas.It is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League.In 2006, a full-blown war broke out between Hezbollah and Israel, triggered when Hezbollah carried out a deadly cross-border raid.Israeli troops invaded southern Lebanon to try to eliminate the threat from Hezbollah. However, it survived and has since increased its number of fighters and obtained new and better weapons.Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah is a Shia cleric who has led Hezbollah since 1992.He played a key role in turning it into a political, as a well as a military, force.He has close links with Iran and its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.These date from 1981, when Iran's first Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, appointed him his personal representative in Lebanon. Nasrallah has not appeared in public for years, purportedly for fear of being assassinated by Israel.However, he remains revered by Hezbollah, and delivers televised speeches every week.More on Israel-Gaza war Hezbollah is one of the most heavily-armed, non-state military forces in the world. It is funded and equipped by Iran.Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah has claimed that it has 100,000 fighters, although independent estimates vary between 20,000 and 50,000. Many are well trained and battle hardened, and fought in the Syrian civil war.It has an estimated 130,000 rockets and missiles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.Most of its arsenal is made up of small, unguided surface-to-surface artillery rockets.But it also thought to have anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as guided missiles capable of striking deep inside Israel.This is much more sophisticated than what Hamas, in the Gaza Strip, has at its disposal. Since the Hamas attack on 7 October, Hezbollah has been attacking military positions in northern Israel.It has launched rockets at Israeli positions, fired anti-tank missiles at armoured vehicles and attacked military targets with explosive drones.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have retaliated, using air strikes, tank and artillery fire against Hezbollah positions in Lebanon.Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah fighters have been killed, and Israel has evacuated thousands of civilians from the area.IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said its forces were on "very high alert" along Israel's northern border.The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has promised a response of "unimaginable" magnitude if Hezbollah opens a second front in the conflict.  	
03/11/2023 14:21:00	Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah makes first speech on Israel-Gaza war - BBC News	Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah, is addressing his followers in his first public comments since the Israel-Hamas war broke out.The speech is likely to indicate the group's next moves, as its fighters and the Israeli army are engaged in intense attacks on the Lebanon-Israel border.This has raised fears the area could become another front in the conflict.So far, however, the violence has largely been contained.Since Hamas carried out the 7 October attacks on Israel, killing more than 1,400 people, Lebanon has been on edge, closely watching Hezbollah. The group has intensified its attacks on Israel, which is retaliating. But both sides have apparently taken steps to avoid a dangerous escalation, and most strikes have been limited to the border area.This, however, could change. Israel is pushing ahead with its ground invasion of Gaza, with the goal of eliminating Hamas, while the number of Palestinians killed in the territory has passed 9,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Hamas, meanwhile, has repeatedly urged its allies to join the fight, and many wonder whether Hezbollah will answer those calls.Hezbollah - which, like Hamas, is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK, the US and others - is the largest political and military force in Lebanon. This means the group's decisions reverberate far beyond its support base, and many here and elsewhere are anxiously waiting for Nasrallah's speech - followers and foes.Nasrallah's whereabouts, as ever, remain a mystery. His address will be broadcast in public screenings organised by the group across the country, and is being framed by Hezbollah as a significant moment. They took the unusual step of announcing it five days in advance and, earlier this week, released dramatic short videos featuring Nasrallah, fuelling the expectation of a major announcement.Many in Lebanon still remember the devastating month-long war Hezbollah fought against Israel in 2006, and worry that the group may drag the country into another conflict. One of Hezbollah's aims is the destruction of Israel, which sees the group as a more formidable enemy than Hamas. Hezbollah has a vast arsenal of weapons that includes precision-guided missiles that can strike deep into Israeli territory, and tens of thousands of well-trained, battle-hardened fighters.The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has promised a response of "unimaginable" magnitude if Hezbollah opens a second front in the conflict. And the US, which reportedly urged Israel to not launch a large-scale attack on the group, has sent two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean to prevent the spread of the conflict.A full-scale war would be disastrous for Lebanon, and there is little public support for it outside Hezbollah's followers. The country is suffering from years of economic crisis, and political impasse has left it without a properly functioning government. Another scenario - perhaps the most likely, some observers say - is an increase of the group's attacks, signalling a response to Hamas's calls, while keeping the fighting limited to northern Israel.The Biden administration is also, in public and through back-channels, warning Iran against escalating the situation. Iran supports the so-called Axis of Resistance, an alliance that includes Hezbollah - its most important force - as well as militias in Iraq, Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, the Houthis in Yemen, and Hamas.It is not clear how much direct influence Tehran has over the groups, but it is unlikely that they take any major decisions without Iran's blessing. On Sunday, the Iranian President, Ebrahim Raisi, said Israel's "crimes had crossed the red lines, which may force everyone to take action". Washington, he added, "asks us to not do anything, but they keep giving widespread support to Israel". A source close to Hezbollah told me, on condition of anonymity, last week, that Nasrallah - who is known for his angry anti-Israeli and anti-American speeches - was closely monitoring the situation and remained in constant contact with the group's military leadership, despite his public silence."Hezbollah is following all details," the source said. "They make calculations all the time." Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.

Esmail Sadeghi, a provincial chief justice, told local media that 16 others were taken to hospital.Iran imposes a death penalty on repeat drug smugglers and dealers but runs a series of rehab programmes for addicts.An initial investigation showed that a heater was the cause of the fire, which then spread to the rest of the centre, the province's deputy governor was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency."The manager and other possible culprits have been arrested so that the cause of the incident is more accurately determined," the Tasnim news site said.The centre accommodated up to 40 people. However, the province's deputy governor Mohammad Jalai said that it was overcrowded, which contributed "to the high number of casualties".Isna, a semi-official Iranian news agency, shared footage of the fire which lit up the sky and sent huge plumes of smoke into the air. Other footage showed firefighters and ambulances gathered outside the site in the aftermath. The centre's roof had been destroyed, its windows shattered and its walls blackened by smoke.Iran has one of the world's highest rates of opiate use and sits on a major smuggling route for opium from Afghanistan - a major producer of illicit drugs.A UN world drug report this year said that Iran made up 47% of the global heroin and morphine seizures originating from Afghanistan during 2020.Iranian authorities frequently try to clamp down on drug abuse and trafficking and they regularly announce large-scale seizures of opioids originating from Afghanistan.Amnesty International said in a June report that Iran had executed at least 173 people convicted of drug-related offences this year after "systematically unfair trials". The figure was nearly three times more than this time last year, the rights group added.	
03/11/2023 12:44:00	Bowen: Five new realities after four weeks of Israel-Gaza war - BBC News	One of the first things to understand about the reportage, analysis and commentary that has poured out since the Hamas attacks of 7 October is that no-one has the full story. Not only is it, as ever, hard to penetrate the fog of war to work out what is happening on the battlefield. The new shape of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has not yet emerged. Events are still moving fast. Fears that the war could spread are very real. New realities in the Middle East are out there somewhere, but their shape and the way that they will work depend on the way this war goes for the rest of the year, and probably beyond. Here are a few things that we know, and a few that we do not. The list is not exhaustive. Some people mocked Donald Rumsfeld, US defence secretary at the time of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when he talked of "unknown unknowns". But in this part of the world as much as any other, they exist - and when they emerge, they can make a big difference. One certainty is that Israelis support the military campaign to break the power in Gaza of Hamas and its junior partner, Islamic Jihad. Their anger is driven by the shock of the Hamas attacks, the killing of more than 1,400 people and the fact that around 240 hostages are still being held in Gaza. I met Noam Tibon, a retired general in the Israeli army, to hear about how he drove down with his wife to Nahal Oz, a kibbutz on the border with Gaza, after Hamas attacked on 7 October. His mission, which was successful, was to rescue his son, his daughter in law and their two young daughters who were in their safe room, hearing Hamas gunmen roaming around outside. Tibon may be retired but he is a very fit-looking 62-year-old. He ended up armed with an assault rifle and a helmet he had taken from a dead Israeli soldier, leading a group of soldiers he had assembled in the chaos of that day, clearing the kibbutz and saving the lives of his family and many others. The general was an old-school, straight-talking Israeli officer. "Gaza is going to suffer… no nation will agree that your neighbour will slaughter babies, women or people. Just like you (Britons) crushed your enemy during World War Two. This is what we need to do in Gaza. No mercy." What, I asked, about innocent Palestinian civilians who are getting killed? "Unfortunately, it's happening. We live in a tough neighbourhood, and we need to survive… we have to be tough. We have no choice."  A lot of Israelis are echoing his sentiment that Palestinian civilian deaths are unfortunate, but they are being killed because of the actions of Hamas. It is also clear that Israel's assault on Hamas is causing terrible bloodshed. The latest figure for Palestinian deaths from Gaza's health ministry, run by Hamas, has exceeded 9,000 - of whom around 65% are children and women. It is not clear how many of the men who have been killed were civilians or fighting for Hamas or Islamic Jihad. US President Joe Biden and the Israelis do not trust the ministry figures. But in past conflicts, Palestinian casualty statistics have been considered accurate by international organisations. One grim milestone is fast approaching. The United Nations (UN) says around 9,700 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since the full-scale Russian invasion 21 months ago.Some of the Palestinian dead would have been part of Hamas. But even if that proportion is as high as 10%, which is unlikely, it means that Israel is on course to have killed as many Palestinian civilians in just over a month as Russia has killed in Ukraine since February 2022. (The UN says its data for Ukraine is incomplete and the true number of civilians killed is likely higher, while in Gaza the number of dead is also likely to be higher as many Palestinians are believed to be buried under rubble).The UN human rights office has said that so many civilians have been killed and wounded in Israeli air strikes that it has serious concerns that the attacks are disproportionate and could be war crimes.From the first days after the Hamas attacks, President Biden has supported Israel's decision to use military force to remove Hamas from power. But he has also added the qualification that it needed to be done "the right way". He meant that Israel should observe the laws of war that protect civilians. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Tel Aviv. Before he took off, he said: "When I see a Palestinian child - a boy, a girl - pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building, that hits me in the gut as much as seeing a child from Israel or anywhere else." I have reported on all of Israel's wars in the last 30 years. I do not remember a US administration stating so publicly that Israel needs to observe the laws of war. Blinken's visit suggests that he believes Israel is not following Biden's advice. Something else we know for certain is that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under great pressure. Unlike Israel's security and military chiefs, he has not accepted any personal responsibility for the catastrophic series of failures that left Israeli border communities virtually undefended on 7 October. Last Sunday, 29 October, he caused uproar when he sent out a tweet blaming the intelligence agencies. Mr Netanyahu deleted the message and apologised.  Three Israelis, a former peace negotiator, the ex-head of the Shin Bet (Israel's internal intelligence agency) and a tech entrepreneur, wrote an article in the journal Foreign Affairs saying that Mr Netanyahu should not have any part of the war and whatever follows. The Israeli PM has loyal supporters, but he has lost the confidence of prominent figures in Israel's military and security establishment. Noam Tibon, the retired general who fought his way into kibbutz Nahal Oz to rescue his family, compares Mr Netanyahu to Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister who was forced to resign in 1940, and replaced by Winston Churchill. Tibon told me: "This is the biggest failure in the history of the state of Israel. It was a military failure. It was an intelligence failure. And it was the failure of the government… the one really in charge - and all the blame is on him - is the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu… He is in charge of the biggest failure in the history of Israel."It is also clear that the old status quo has been smashed. It was unpleasant and dangerous, but it seemed to have a certain grimly-familiar stability. Since the end of the last Palestinian uprising around 2005 a pattern has emerged that Mr Netanyahu believed could be sustained indefinitely. That was a dangerous illusion, for all concerned - Palestinians as well as Israelis. The argument went that the Palestinians were no longer a threat to Israel. Instead, they were a problem to be managed. The tools available include sticks, carrots and the ancient tactic of "divide and rule". Mr Netanyahu, who has been prime minister for most of the time since 2009 - after an earlier spell between 1996 and 1999 - has argued consistently that Israel does not have a partner for peace. Potentially, it did. The Palestinian Authority (PA), which is the main rival to Hamas, is a deeply flawed organisation, and many who support it believe its aged President Mahmoud Abbas needs to step aside. But it accepted the idea of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel back in the 1990s. "Divide and rule" for Mr Netanyahu meant allowing Hamas to build its power in Gaza at the expense of the PA. While Israel's longest-serving prime minister is always careful about what he says in public, his actions over many years show that he does not want to allow the Palestinians to have an independent state. That would involve giving up land in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which the Israeli right wing believes belongs to the Jews. From time to time, Mr Netanyahu's pronouncements would leak. In 2019, a number of Israeli sources say that he told a group of his Likud members of parliament that if they opposed a Palestinian state they should support schemes to pump money - mostly provided by Qatar - into Gaza. He told them that deepening the division between Hamas in Gaza and the PA in the West Bank would make it impossible to establish a state. It is also clear that Israel, backed by the Americans, will not tolerate a deal that allows Hamas to stay in power. That guarantees a lot more bloodshed. It also raises big questions about what or who replaces them, which so far have not been answered. The conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea has lasted for more than 100 years. One lesson of its long and bloody history is that there will never be a military solution. In the 1990s, the Oslo peace process was established to try to end the conflict by establishing a Palestinian state with a capital in East Jerusalem alongside Israel. The last attempt to revive it, after years of on-off negotiations, happened during the Obama administration. It failed a decade ago, and since then the conflict has been allowed to fester. As President Biden and many others have said, the only possible chance for avoiding more wars is to establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel. That will not be possible with the current leaders on either side.  Extremists, both Israeli and Palestinian, would do all they could to scupper the idea, as they have done since the 1990s. Some of them believe they are following the will of God, which makes it impossible to persuade them to accept a secular compromise. But if this war does not deliver enough of a shock to break deeply-held prejudices and to make the idea of two states viable, nothing will. And without a mutually-acceptable way of ending the conflict, more generations of Palestinians and Israelis will be sentenced to more wars. 	
03/11/2023 11:33:00	Sheffield City Council to review policy after Israeli flag backlash - BBC News	A council has said it would review its policy on town hall flags, but has refused to apologise for hoisting the Israeli flag after a backlash.A protester scaled Sheffield Town Hall last month and replaced the flag with a Palestinian one.The council said the flag was an act of solidarity after Hamas launched an attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip.Leader Tom Hunt said he recognised "it caused hurt for some people" but an apology risked causing further hurt.Sheffield City Council flew the Israeli flag days after dozens of Hamas armed fighters crossed into Israel from Gaza in a surprise attack, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 220 hostages.Mr Hunt said the decision was made before Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes, which Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said had so far killed more than 9,000 people.In a video clip shared online, people could be heard shouting "take it down" and cheering as the Israeli flag was lowered from the 200ft town hall by a protester.It also prompted a petition, which gathered more than 1,300 signatures, calling on the council to apologise for its actions. The petition was presented to the authority at a meeting of the full council where Mr Hunt responded to it.The leader explained the UK government had asked local authorities to consider flying the Israeli flag on public buildings to show solidarity.He said the flag was flown "to show solidarity with the victims" of the Hamas attack and was not about "taking sides in a decades-long conflict", according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. He added: "The decision was taken in good faith and of course, I and others have reflected on it over the last few weeks as the horror of what we have seen in Israel has been replaced by the horror we have seen in Gaza."It was right to show solidarity but I recognise that this act of solidarity caused hurt for some people."Mr Hunt said the council would review its flag protocol and added: "Flying the flag was not a straightforward decision and it has prompted a range of responses and heartfelt emotions."Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

03/11/2023 00:31:00	A doctor, tailor, and bride-to-be: Stories of those killed in Gaza - BBC News	The death toll in Gaza is rising as Israel presses on with its war against Hamas, following the attacks on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed in Israel.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed since the war began. Because of safety concerns, there are relatively few journalists in Gaza to document the human cost of the fighting. But the BBC has been speaking to a number of families and eyewitnesses who have told us stories of loved ones who have been killed in recent days.With serious power supply issues in the Gaza Strip, Yusof and his two older siblings - sister Jury, 13, and nine-year-old brother Hamed - felt quite lucky.Their father, Mohamed Abu Musa, a radiographer at the Nasser hospital in the city of Khan Younis, had installed solar panels at their house, so the children could watch their favourite cartoons on TV.They were settling down in front of the television on 15 October when, their father says, their home was hit by an Israeli air strike.Jury and Hamed somehow survived, but Yusof was killed when the roof of their house collapsed.He was seven years old.Mohamed was working a 24-hour shift at the hospital when his wife, Rawan, entered, screaming in search for their youngest son.She had been able to find Hamed, while rescue teams helped pull Jury out of the rubble. Jury had suffered head injuries but her parents say she is "improving".A video showing Rawan asking at the hospital for her "handsome and curly-haired son" circulated widely on social media. But Mohamed would later find his son's body in the hospital morgue."The last time I saw Yusof alive was when he ran to hug me on the doorstep of our home, just before I left for work," Mohamed recalls."He kissed me and said goodbye after I had given him some biscuits and bananas. He wanted to be a doctor, maybe because he always saw me going to hospital for work."On the evening of 15 October, Dr Saidam needed a rest. The 47-year-old surgeon had not left the al-Shifa hospital, in Gaza City for more than week.He told his colleagues he was going home for the night. But a few hours later he was killed in a strike at his home."This calm, funny and kind-hearted man came back to the hospital the next morning, but as a lifeless body," his colleague Dr Adnan Albursh explained.Dr Albursh, who had known the surgeon for more than 20 years, added that his late colleague had been nicknamed "the relentless surgeon" by his peers for his dedication to the job.A veteran of the operating room, Dr Saidam was also known as a great mentor to younger doctors."If any of the doctors faced any difficulties, they knew Dr Saidam was the one who would sort it out," agreed Dr Ahmed El Mokhallalati, the head of the plastic surgery department at al-Shifa Hospital."His death is a huge loss not only to this hospital but also to the medical profession," he added.Seventeen-year-old student Nour was killed on 11 October when an Israeli air strike hit her family home in the town of Deir al-Balah, 14km south of Gaza City, according to her uncle.Mohammed al-Kharma said his niece wanted to relocate because of the bombing and stay with relatives elsewhere."Her father asked her to stay in her house, which was bombed the very next morning. It was her fate," he said.Nour was killed alongside her nephew Yazan. The pair had been playing in the living room. Her elder sisters, Ola, and Huda, who were preparing breakfast with their mother, Jamalat, survived.Nour was in her last year of high school and always wanted to be a doctor. Her uncle said his family pulled her school bag from under the rubble. It contained books and a diary, and in one of the pages she had written: "I want to make my family proud of me and I will get high grades by the will of Allah."In her last communication with her fiance Khaled al-Masry, Lurin said she was exhausted from moving from place to place in search of safety from the war. The 30-year-old had just arrived at the Nusairat refugee camp, in the centre of the Gaza Strip, to stay with her aunt.Lurin had survived two strikes, including one on 16 October that flattened the building where she lived with her parents in Gaza City."She told me she was going to have a shower, pray and rest," Khaled recalls.According to her fiance, who lives and works in Cyprus, she was praying in a room when the house she was in was hit."She was killed while she was praying," he says.Lurin and Khaled had postponed their wedding a couple of times due to the unstable situation in Gaza.They were planning finally to get married in December and move to Cyprus.A devastated Khaled said: "She is now resting forever. She used to wear a white dress, but now is wearing a white shroud."People in Gaza City's Radwan district who needed women's formal clothing would head straight to Fekriya Hassan Abdul A'al's place."I remember when we used to have our house full of brides-to-be and bridesmaids who would come to my mother's place to have a fitting. She was exceptionally talented," Fekriya's daughter Nevine says.The 65-year-old tailor was killed along with two of her siblings, two of her children and two of her grandchildren, after the house they were sheltering in was hit by an air strike on 23 October.Nevine, who was taking cover at a friend's house, says that Fekriya was devoted to her family and would host large weekly gatherings. But Nevine says her mood had been severely affected by the escalation in the conflict: "She told me in our last phone call: 'I'm very depressed and exhausted from what seems to be an endless war'."Brothers Mazen, 17 and Ahmed, 13 were among those killed by the explosion at the al-Ahli Hospital on 17 October.Palestinian officials say the blast was caused by an Israeli air strike. But the Israeli military say it was the result of a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad - an accusation the group rejected.Arafat Abu Massi, the father of Mazen and Ahmed, said the two brothers were "very close to each other" but had very different personalities.Arafat and his wife had undergone IVF therapy for eight years to have Mazen, who was at high school and wanted to become a dentist. "He was the brightest of all my children," he says. While Ahmed was described by his father as "the strongest and bravest in the family" - and the entrepreneurial one."He used to sell toys and school supplies in a small booth near our house," Arafat said.His only remaining child now is three-year-old Faraj, who, according to Arafat, keeps crying and asking where his siblings are. "I told him that God has chosen them to stay in heaven. That is a better place for my two young smart gentlemen."Salam Mema, a 32-year-old Palestinian journalist, was killed on 10 October when her house in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, was hit by an Israeli air strike, her friend told the BBC.Her husband, their two-year-old daughter Sham, their seven-year-old son Hadi, and other members of the family, were also killed, leaving their five-year-old son Ali as the sole survivor.As of 31 October, Salam was one of 31 journalists confirmed killed on both sides, since the Israel-Hamas conflict began.The 26-year-old pharmacist was killed in an air strike in the southern city of Rafah, on 17 October.She was sleeping beside her three-month-old baby girl Elyana, and her husband.Safaa's uncle and a retired medical doctor based in the UK, Omar Hassouna, said her parents managed to survive the strike but are in shock and devastated by her death.Omar said the last time he saw his niece was in January, during his holiday in Gaza. "Safaa was polite, helpful, and loved by everyone."I have lost a lovely niece. Her death is unfair, as all the deaths of all of the civilians in Gaza have been.""I would prefer to be in Gaza with them right now, I feel so hopeless here."	
02/11/2023 23:05:00	Palestinian-American couple and baby boy finally escape Gaza - BBC News	A Palestinian-American family has managed to flee Gaza after nearly a month trapped in the war-torn enclave.Abood Okal, Wafaa Abuzayda and their one-year-old son, Yousef, crossed safely into Egypt through the Rafah crossing on Thursday morning, a family friend told the BBC.The trio were among a list of 400 US citizens and 100 others approved by border authorities to leave Gaza.But several hundred more foreign nationals remain inside the enclave.For the Okals, who reside in the quiet Boston suburb of Medway, Massachusetts, the war shattered a joyful reunion with the grandparents Yousef had never met.After flying into Tel Aviv last month, they took in the sights of Jerusalem, journeyed through the West Bank, went to the beach, shared meals and rode horses together.Then, six days before they were to catch a flight back to Boston, Hamas launched its attack on Israel, which responded by bombarding Gaza.Heeding Israel's warnings to flee south, the Okals left Ms Abuzayda's parents' home in Jabalia, in northern Gaza. They do not know if the house - which is in the vicinity of a refugee camp that was bombed on Tuesday - remains intact.By the following weekend, they had made their way to Rafah and holed up in a house about five minutes from the border crossing into Egypt."The general understanding was that, if there was going to be any opportunity for American citizens to get out, it was going to be through Egypt," Sammy Nabulsi, a family friend, said.According to Mr Nabulsi, over the past three weeks Mr Okal attempted to make daily contact with the US state department and the American embassies in Cairo and Jerusalem.On four separate occasions, they were advised to go to the Rafah crossing, waiting in line for up to eight hours but never receiving permission to cross.Mr Nabulsi, who told the BBC he spoke with the family nearly every day of their ordeal. A real estate lawyer by trade, he said he contacted White House and state department officials, as well as several members of the US Congress, on the Okals' behalf.But, he told the BBC, officials offered vague and shifting explanations for why his friends were unable to get out.It was an experience that left him concerned the government was not prioritising rescuing its citizens from Gaza, and left the Okals feeling "completely hopeless and abandoned".All the while, the family's circumstances were growing more dire with each passing day.The house in Rafah where they were staying was a single-family unit, but they shared it with 40 others.With no running water or fuel, the residents were limiting how often they flushed the toilets and drinking saltwater from the well to stay hydrated.With no cooking oil on hand, the family was largely living off canned tuna and fava beans, according to Mr Nabulsi.Their last visit to the bakery lasted six hours and their last water run yielded only a few litres for the whole house to share.But the hardest part for Mr Okal and Ms Abuzayda was watching how the conditions were affecting their son, said Mr Nabulsi.When the war broke out, Yousef had occasionally woken up startled by the sound of airstrikes.But more recently, he had begun to wake up screaming, apparently from night terrors, even when it was quiet outside. Oftentimes, he was inconsolable and would not go back to sleep."In the early days, every time there was an airstrike, [his mum] would try to smile and clap to convince him it was just fireworks," Mr Nabulsi said.A few days ago, he added, they had run out of milk and were unable to find any more.Mr Nabulsi says Mr Okal is a research director at the Bristol Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company, and that Ms Abuzayda worked at a Boston non-profit for young adults.On Thursday, the family's names appeared on a list published by Gaza's border authority with permission to enter Egypt.Mr Nabulsi confirmed to the BBC the trio crossed into Egypt shortly after 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) and was being transported to Cairo by US consular affairs officials."The Okal family is overwhelmed with the love and support they have received from home and abroad, but they are also exhausted, physically and emotionally drained, and have a long journey ahead of them back to the United States," he said in a statement.The family, he added, is asking for privacy and the safe departure of all remaining Americans, as well as "compassion and prayers for the innocent civilians in Gaza, who gave them shelter, who helped them find food and water, but who continue to be without their own supply of food, water, fuel, or medicine to live".	
02/11/2023 20:46:00	When they called their mother, Hamas answered the phone - BBC News	Nearly four weeks have passed since Hamas kidnapped about 240 people into Gaza - among them is 84-year-old Ditza Heiman. When Ditza's daughter called her on 7 October, Hamas answered the phone."They were shouting 'It's Hamas, it's Hamas'," another daughter, Neta Heiman Mina, told the BBC."My sister was terrified, she hung up. I didn't think they had taken her. I thought they had killed her."Ditza Heiman is being held hostage in Gaza. She was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz when Hamas staged its deadly attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostage.Neta says she was in touch with her mother in the morning. Ditza was in her safe room and didn't know what was happening outside. "I don't think she realised, or we realised, that the terrorists were at the kibbutz," Neta said.The last message she got from her mother was a few minutes before 10:00 local time. After that she didn't answer her phone. Neta later spoke to one of her mother's neighbours, who told her that Ditza had been calling for help. He went out to see what was happening and saw her being taken away by Hamas gunmen. "There were too many terrorists outside, they started shooting. He crawled back into his shelter. He was lucky," Neta said. On a Hamas Facebook page, Neta and her sister found a video that showed her mother. "They took her. They put her in a car. When we found the video, we knew she was alive." Ditza Heiman had lived all her adult life in Nir Oz. A social worker who had only stopped working a few years ago, she has 12 grandchildren, five great-grandchildren and "so many more children who grew up with her and consider her to be family".Neta's voice is unwavering as she talks about her mother. She lived on her own, she cooked for herself, she walked places."But she walked slowly. I don't think she could walk for many kilometres, like Yocheved," Neta said, referring to 85-year-old Yocheved Lifschitz who was freed last month and who has spoken of having to walk in the tunnels. Ms Lifschitz described being taken into a "spider's web" of tunnels underneath Gaza.Neta is very worried about the ground offensive in Gaza. She doesn't know what it means for the hostages, and she is also concerned for the young soldiers."They are all friends of my children, they are children of my friends. I don't think it will bring the hostages back," she said.She wants Israel's government to "talk directly to Hamas".A long-time activist with Women Wage Peace, the largest Israeli grassroots peace movement made up of Jewish and Arab women, she has long campaigned for an agreement-based resolution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.She also blames Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government for what has happened."In the last nine months they did everything to escalate the situation, especially in the West Bank," she said. She says that Hamas attacked at a time when many Israeli troops had been stationed in the occupied West Bank."The army was there [in the West Bank], to protect the Sukkah [a shelter put up as part of a Jewish festival]." she says, referring to tensions in the flashpoint town of Huwara."They were there and they didn't protect my mother. And now they need to do everything to bring them [the hostages] back."	
02/11/2023 19:35:00	Israel says Hamas stages hit-and-run attacks from tunnels - BBC News	Israeli forces have encircled the Hamas stronghold of Gaza City, Israel's military says, as it continues its assault on the Gaza Strip.The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said soldiers were engaged in close quarters combat with Hamas fighters staging hit-and-run attacks from tunnels. The UN said four of its schools being used as shelters had been damaged and warned water shortages were worsening.The Hamas-run health ministry says over 9,000 Palestinians have been killed.On Thursday the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said four of its schools being used as shelters had been damaged in less than 24 hours.At least 20 people were reportedly killed at a school in the Jabalia refugee camp, UNRWA said, while a child was reportedly killed at a school-turned-shelter in the Beach refugee camp.The BBC has verified two videos from the schools.One extremely graphic video, filmed at an elementary school in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, shows the aftermath, first outside the main gate of the school and then in the main courtyard.At least 20 people, either dead or injured, can be seen on the ground, including men, women and children.The second video, filmed at the main courtyard of a primary school in Beach refugee camp, also in northern Gaza but near the Mediterranean coast, shows a plume of smoke rising from behind the main building of the school.Several people, including children, run for safety in the courtyard, while some residents of the camp watch from the windows above. A series of explosions can be heard in the background of the video. The last one, the loudest, causes the crowd in the courtyard to flee in panic.Hamas authorities in Gaza blamed Israeli air strikes. The IDF has not yet commented.UN-appointed experts have called for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, saying time was running out for Palestinian people there who find themselves at "grave risk of genocide"."The situation in Gaza has reached a catastrophic tipping point," they said, warning that a ban on fuel entering Gaza and disruption to water supplies meant people had little access to safe drinking water."Water is essential to human life and today, two million Gazans are struggling to find drinking water," they said. The Israeli mission to the UN in Geneva called the comments "deplorable and deeply concerning" and blamed Hamas for civilian deaths.Earlier on Thursday the IDF said it had killed about 130 Hamas fighters.Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said troops were at "the height of battle"."We've had impressive successes and have passed the outskirts of Gaza City. We are advancing," he said in a statement.A number of foreign nationals were able to leave Gaza after the Rafah crossing with Egypt opened for a second day. President Biden says more than 70 Americans were among them.But medical aid organisation Doctors Without Borders says more than 20,000 wounded people remained trapped in the territory. Meanwhile, the Lebanese movement Hezbollah said it had attacked 19 targets in Israel simultaneously, in what would be its most intense assault on Israel so far.The Israeli military said it was striking a series of Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in response.It comes a day before a much-anticipated speech by the leader of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah, his first public address since the conflict broke out last month.	
02/11/2023 17:28:00	Palestinian Americans trapped in Gaza wait desperately to leave - BBC News	Almost a month since the war broke out, Folla Saqer and her two children are still trapped in Gaza.Her husband, Ramiz Younis, is anxiously waiting for news that they have finally got out.The children - Zain, two, and Zaina, nine months - are American citizens. Along with Ms Saqer, a permanent legal resident, they are among roughly 1,000 people waiting to cross into neighbouring Egypt and begin their return to the US.The children are on a list published by Gaza's border authority approved to leave the enclave on Thursday, along with some 500 other foreigners, including 400 Americans.Ms Saqer - whose name is not on the list - attempted to pass through the Rafah crossing on Thursday morning but was denied, according to Justin Eisele, a lawyer for the family.He said no reason was provided, but "based on comparing notes with other people", her immigration status - a permanent resident, but not a citizen -  "seems to be the distinction".Since Wednesday, foreign passport holders and injured Gazans have been allowed through the Rafah crossing for the first time since the war began.But the US State Department has struggled to provide specifics on its processes for getting people out, and critics allege that government officials have been haphazard and vague in their correspondence.It is all stoking growing frustration among some Palestinian Americans as they, or their families, scramble to get out of Gaza.According to Mr Eisele, Ms Saqer was never made aware until her visit to the border that she - as a green card holder - would be unable to cross into Egypt.When her passage was barred, "she elected to not hand her babies to a stranger", he told the BBC."Before we give Israel $15bn, could we take a minute to organise a mother crossing the border with her children?" he asked. "You can ship rockets that can level a building but you can't organise a simple border crossing with two of our allegedly strongest allies?"In a statement to the BBC, the State Department declined to say why Ms Saqer was unable to pass through the Rafah crossing."The Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas. It has been a top priority for us to get Rafah open not just for trucks coming in, but for US citizens and other foreign nationals coming out," a spokesperson said."We expect exits to continue over the next several days. We will not stop working to get US citizens and their family members out as safely as possible."So desperate is Mr Younis to have his wife and children back home that, on Monday, the 51-year-old filed a federal lawsuit accusing the US government of discrimination and failure to do its duty towards its citizens.The legal action, which names Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin as defendants, alleges the family has been "let down and ignored as if we are second-class citizens".The Gaza-born Mr Younis returned to the enclave four years ago after marrying Ms Saqer. The couple resettled in Baltimore, Maryland, last year.Feeling homesick, Ms Saqer took the children to Gaza on a short trip earlier this year. She intended to come back in mid-October, by which time Mr Younis had completed their move to Little Rock, Arkansas.When the conflict erupted, Mr Younis immediately urged her to travel to the Egyptian border and wait for an opportunity to cross.In those first three days, he said, he didn't contact the State Department: "The crossing was open and I thought I can do this on my own," he said.Ms Saqer took the children to her sister's place in Rafah, a 10-minute drive from the border. But the first time she attempted to leave, the waiting area by the crossing was bombed. In the frantic rush for cover, she left all their luggage behind.With the crossing closed, Mr Younis provided his family's information to the State Department. He received an email on 14 October with instructions that the crossing would open for five hours the next day.Ms Saqer and the children again went and waited, but they were not let through.Similar updates, including from local US embassies, would follow in the ensuing days, urging Ms Saqer to go to the border. She made four more trips. "Whenever we have the chance to communicate, my wife asks me for news [from the government]," said Mr Younis."Sometimes I don't have news, but I keep the hope alive. I need to keep the hope alive even if there is nothing happening."The Okals, a suburban Massachusetts family who have been trapped in Gaza, are on the list of foreigners approved to leave the territory on Thursday. Abood Okal and Wafaa Abuzayda took their one-year-old son, Yousef, to the enclave last month to visit the grandparents he had never met.The family shared meals, went to the beach and rode horses together - until Hamas launched its attack on Israel six days before the Okals' intended departure.From Ms Abuzayda's home in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, the trio heeded Israeli warnings and fled south. Nobody knows if their home - which is located very close to a refugee camp bombed on Tuesday - is still standing.For nearly three weeks, the trio have stayed in a single-family home in Rafah with 40 other people, waiting for an opportunity to cross into Egypt.Every single day, they have contacted the State Department, as well as US embassies in Cairo and Jerusalem, according to Sammy Nabulsi, a family friend.On four separate occasions, they were advised to go to the Rafah crossing, waiting up to eight hours to cross."Their circumstances right now are completely dire and dangerous," said Mr Nabulsi on Wednesday.The 40-person house has lost running water and fuel, he told the BBC. Its residents are limiting the number of times they flush the toilets and with no cooking oil on hand, the family is largely living off canned tuna and fava beans.Their last visit to the bakery lasted six hours and their last water run yielded only a few litres for the whole house to share.Worst of all, Yousef often wakes up screaming inconsolably from night terrors and cannot go back to sleep."That poor kid is just completely traumatised," said Mr Nabulsi, adding that Yousef's parents have run out of milk for him to drink.Mr Okal, who holds a PhD in cancer research, is a director at the Bristol Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company. Ms Abuzayda worked at a local non-profit and now cares for their son. "They're just the kindest people. They're really funny and sweet," Mr Nabulsi said."They live in Massachusetts. They should be in Massachusetts."	
02/11/2023 16:30:00	US President Joe Biden calls for 'pause' in Israel-Gaza conflict - BBC News	US President Joe Biden has called for a "pause" in the Israel-Hamas conflict. The president was making a campaign speech in Minneapolis when a heckler urged him to call for a ceasefire."I think we need a pause," he replied, saying that it would allow for hostages to get out.An unconfirmed number of American citizens left Gaza on Wednesday, as part of the first group to depart since war broke out. Another 400 are on a list to leave on Thursday.The Okals, a suburban Massachusetts family, were visiting relatives in Gaza when the conflict began. They are among those on the list provided by Gaza's border authority.Family friend Sammy Nabulsi told the BBC that Abood Okal, Wafaa Abuzayda and their one-year-old son, Yousef, have been living in "dire and dangerous" circumstances.There are no Canadians on the list on Wednesday or on the list for Thursday. Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said there were 400 Canadian citizens, mostly dual nationals, trapped in Gaza. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw 239 people taken hostage.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.In Wednesday's speech, the president said a pause would "give time to get the prisoners out". White House officials later explained he had meant both getting hostages held by Hamas out and humanitarian aid in, the Associated Press reports.The UN has urged a ceasefire to ease the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where 1.4 million people are estimated to have been displaced.But the UK, US, Canada and EU have stopped short of calling for a ceasefire, saying it would favour Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organisation by the US and several Western governments.Speaking to reporters on Thursday, new House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, one of the most powerful Republicans in US government, firmly rejected the idea of a ceasefire. "Israel doesn't need a ceasefire," he said. "It needs its allies to cease with the politics and deliver support now, and that's what we're doing."Mr Johnson said the House would vote later on Thursday on a $14.3bn (£11.7bn) aid package for Israel.Democrats oppose the bill because it also contains steep cuts in funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and they are expected to block it in the Senate. Even then, President Biden has said he will veto the legislation if the version that reaches his desk includes cuts to the tax collection agency.	
02/11/2023 16:29:00	Tanzanian student in Israel: 'Shift change saved me, but my friends are Hamas hostages' - BBC News	"If I was not on the farm that morning, I would be one of the missing," Ezekiel Kitiku told the BBC from southern Israel.Two of his fellow Tanzanians - Joshua Loitu Mollel and Clemence Felix Mtenga - were among more than 230 people taken as hostages to the Gaza Strip, which is under the control of Hamas, proscribed as a terrorist group in the UK and some other countries.The three students had landed in Israel in September, excited to start their work as agricultural interns for the next 11 months.Since their arrival, Ezekiel Kitiku and Mr Mtenga had been living on Kibbutz Nir Oz and working at a dairy farm in the afternoons. Their friend Mr Mollel was staying and working about 30km (18 miles) away at Kibbutz Nahal Oz. Both kibbutzes have a population of several hundred people and are very near Gaza."That week the new timetable was prepared and my name was mentioned to work on the nightshifts, but Clemence remained on afternoon shifts," Mr Kitiku told the BBC. Mr Mollel was on day shifts at a different farm.At around 01:00 on 7 October, Mr Kitiku says he set off in the dark on his bike and rode five minutes to the farm to start his shift.He spent the early hours of that morning milking cows and carrying out veterinary duties. By 06:00, as the sun started to rise, he was tending to cattle inside a shed.  Thirty minutes later he heard a huge explosion. This was when Hamas began to fire rockets from Gaza. "When I heard the noise, I remembered that we had been told that if we hear the sound of shooting or bombs we should go to the shelter, so that's what I did."I was so scared. It was my first time to hear a noise like this." As he headed to the shelter, he noticed thick smoke and orange flames billowing from near his kibbutz, so he immediately contacted both of his friends. "They told me that there were so many rockets coming from Gaza - and that they were going to the shelters too." Unknown to him, however, Hamas gunmen had already begun raiding the two kibbutzes where his friends were.  A couple of hours later, he noticed that his WhatsApp and text messages were no longer being delivered to their phones.  "I thought maybe their phones were out of charge. The last message I sent to them was - 'Are you safe?'" Neither replied. This was at around 10:00. He has not heard from them since.As rockets hammered down throughout the day, Mr Kitiku was forced to remain at the farm, trying to sleep inside the shelter. The following morning when things seemed a little calmer and desperate to find out what had happened to his friends, he begged his manager to take him back to his kibbutz. There he could see that troops from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had been deployed."At the gate of the kibbutz there were so many IDF soldiers. They refused me entry and told me I would have to go back to stay at the farm because it was safer." He remained in the shelter at the farm with two others for another two days - with barely any food - and another night on his own.In the end the IDF said he would not be able to return to his kibbutz and soldiers escorted him to another location around 30km north of Gaza.As he left the farm, he was shocked by what he saw outside the gates.  "The water systems had been bombed, and water was flowing everywhere. I saw dead bodies on the street.  "The fear of what had happened to my friends started to grow." The three men had met in Tanzania's economic hub of Dar es Salaam through their agriculture studies a few months before they travelled to Israel.  It was not until three weeks after the Hamas attack that Mr Kitiku finally found out what had happened to his friends.The Israeli foreign affairs ministry announced in a statement on Sunday that they were being held hostage in Gaza. He says he is grateful to learn that they are both alive, but remains concerned about their conditions. He also knows other students on their programme who have been taken hostage, including one from Thailand.In addition to those they took hostage, Hamas gunmen killed about 1,400 people on 7 October, many of whom were living on kibbutzes.Since then, Israel has carried out air strikes on the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-run health ministry says some 9,000 people have been killed.Mr Kitiku says he is extremely worried about the safety of his friends being held in the Gaza Strip."There is so much bombing and people have few social services. I try to put myself in their shoes, but I cannot imagine what they are going through."   He says the realisation of how close he came to being caught up in the attack lies heavy on his mind. "The first few days, psychologically I was not stable. I am trying to force myself to cope with the situation. "If I was not on the farm that morning, I would be one of the missing." He is now working at a different farm."The authorities in Israel told us we are safe and we can continue our internship here," he says.He and other Tanzanian students - there are an estimated 260 in Israel - have been offered assistance by their embassy to return home should they wish to, he says."But how can I think about going home when I don't know the situation and the condition of my two friends in Gaza?"	
02/11/2023 15:22:00	Iran prison blocks Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi's hospital care, family says - BBC News	Iranian prison authorities have blocked jailed Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi's hospital care after she refused to wear a hijab, relatives say.Ms Mohammadi, 51, was refused a transfer from Evin prison for treatment for a heart condition, her family said. "The prison warden [said] sending her without a headscarf was prohibited," they said in a statement.Mohammadi was awarded the prize in October "for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran".The family warned that her life was at risk.There was no immediate comment from Iranian authorities.On Monday, a medical team came to the women's wing of Evin to examine Ms Mohammadi and carry out an echocardiogram scan after "the prison even refused to transfer Narges to the infirmary" without a headscarf, the family said on her Instagram account.They said the scan showed two veins with severe blockages and high lung pressure, with a coronary angiogram and lung scan urgently needed."She is willing to risk her life by not wearing the 'forced hijab', even for medical treatment," the family said."Two days and nights, a group of women in Evin protested in the prison yard to send Narges Mohammadi to the heart hospital."The prison warden announced that, according to the orders of the higher authorities, sending her to the heart hospital without a headscarf was prohibited, and her transfer was cancelled."Mohammadi is serving multiple sentences in Tehran's Evin prison amounting to about 12 years, according to the Front Line Defenders rights organisation.Her Nobel prize came in the wake of months-long protests across Iran triggered by the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, 22, who had been arrested for allegedly flouting the Islamic republic's strict dress rules for women.Ms Mohammadi has since announced she would not under any circumstances wear a hijab, which has been obligatory for women in public spaces since shortly after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.In a message expressing gratitude for the prize, read by her daughter and posted on the Nobel website this week, Ms Mohammadi described the compulsory hijab as a "means of control and repression imposed on society".Earlier this week, she also expressed outrage over what she described as the "murder" of 17-year-old Armita Garawand, who activists say died after being beaten by the Tehran morality police for not wearing a headscarf. Iranian authorities deny she was beaten.	
02/11/2023 06:41:00	Egypt opens Gaza border crossing to evacuate injured and foreign nationals - BBC News	Ambulances took 76 seriously injured Palestinians from Gaza into Egypt on Wednesday for the first time since the war between Hamas and Israel began.A group of 335 foreign passport holders - including British nationals - were also allowed to leave via the Rafah crossing, officials said. Gaza's borders have been closed since Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October.Rafah is expected to continue opening for limited time periods to let foreign nationals and injured civilians leave.The lists of those allowed to cross will be agreed between Egypt and Israel, with embassies from the relevant countries being informed in advance to ensure they can prepare to receive their citizens, Western officials say. The BBC understands there are about 7,000 dual nationals in Gaza. Speaking on Wednesday evening, US President Joe Biden said that thanks to "concerted American leadership, safe passage for wounded Palestinians and foreign nationals has started".American citizens were able to exit, he said, as part of the first group of "probably more than 1,000", adding that the process would continue over "the coming days"."We're working non-stop to get Americans out of Gaza as soon and as safely as possible," Mr Biden stressed.UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly earlier said the departure of the first of the estimated 200 Britons in the territory was "a hugely important first step"."We are working with Egyptian and Israeli authorities to ensure the crossing stays open so all British nationals can get to safety in the coming days," he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.Israel has been bombarding Gaza for more than three weeks and has recently sent in ground forces in response to an unprecedented cross-border assault by Hamas gunmen in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 taken hostage. Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,700 people have been killed in the territory since then, while the UN says supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Ambulances were seen rushing to Rafah on Wednesday morning. At least two children were among the wounded - one with a bandaged stomach. After medical checks, they were carried away on stretchers.At least 76 had arrived in Egypt by the evening, according to a spokesperson for the Palestinian border authority and an Egyptian official."Hospitals in the Gaza Strip are treating large numbers of injured people while suffering from a lack of medical supplies. Therefore [they] cannot operate on such cases," Nassem Hasan, a medic working with Gaza's health ministry, told Reuters news agency. "Now they are being transported to the Egyptian side, and will then be evaluated and might be relocated to another hospital."Most of the patients will be taken to a field hospital built by Egyptian authorities in Sheikh Zuweid, 15km (9 miles) from Rafah. Others will go to permanent hospitals in the nearby town of El-Arish or the city of Ismailia.The director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, welcomed Egypt's decision to accept medical evacuations. But he warned: "Attention must not be diverted from the far greater needs of thousands of patients in Gaza, many of them extremely fragile who cannot be moved. "We need an immediate acceleration in the flow of medical aid permitted into Gaza. Hospitals must be protected from bombardment and military use." The WHO says more than a third of Gaza's hospitals are not functioning, while the rest are only partly working and are overwhelmed by casualties. Gaza's health ministry says more than 20,000 people have been injured.  The Palestinian border authority said 335 foreign and dual nationals had crossed by Wednesday evening.As well as the unspecified number of Britons, they included 31 Austrians, five French nationals, four Italians and some Americans. Médecins Sans Frontières said 22 of its international staff had successfully crossed.  Egyptian state-run Al-Qahera News TV broadcast footage showing what it said was the first group getting off a coach, which included many women and young children. Mohammed Ghalayini, a British scientist from Manchester who had been in Gaza visiting family when the war began, accompanied his uncle to the crossing after he was named by Gaza authorities on the list of potential evacuees.   "People are really afraid of what's going on and so if they have a chance to leave, they're trying to leave," he told the BBC.    "But getting to the border is a struggle as well, because fuel supplies are short," he added. "So you know, I saw people arriving on a donkey cart with their luggage at the border."Other British nationals hoping to cross in the coming days include the parents-in-law of Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf. He welcomed news that the border was opening up, but said his in-laws were trapped without clean drinking water and with rapidly diminishing supplies. Also on Wednesday, another an Israeli air strike destroyed several residential buildings in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, for the second day in a row.Video footage and photos showed a scene of devastation in the north-western Fallujah area, with hundreds of people searching for survivors underneath rubble and shattered buildings.The Hamas-run health ministry said dozens of people were killed or wounded in the attack.On Wednesday night, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued a statement saying its fighter jets "struck a Hamas command and control complex" in Jabalia. "We can confirm that Hamas terrorists were eliminated in the strike," it added."Hamas deliberately builds its terror infrastructure under, around and within civilian buildings, intentionally endangering Gazan civilians."The IDF also said it had been urging residents of Jabalia and other parts of northern Gaza to evacuate "to mitigate harm to civilians", as tanks and troops continue to advance from a number of directions.On Tuesday, the IDF said a strike in the centre of Jabalia camp had killed a senior Hamas commander and "a large number of terrorists" inside "underground terror infrastructure" embedded beneath buildings. The infrastructure and buildings had collapsed as a result, it added.Gaza's health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded. But a nearby hospital said it received 400 casualties, including 120 dead.Hamas denied that the commander was dead but said seven of the hostages taken from Israel, including three foreign passport holders, were killed in the strike - a claim that could not be verified.In a brief statement on X on Wednesday, the UN human rights office warned: "Given the high number of civilian casualties & the scale of destruction following Israeli air strikes on Jabalia refugee camp, we have serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes."UN Secretary General António Guterres's spokesman also said he was "appalled over the escalating violence in Gaza" and reiterated that all parties must abide by international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution.	
02/11/2023 00:30:00	Israel Gaza: Children must be off limits, says father of abducted kids - BBC News	In the garden of his home in central Israel, amid the palm trees dappled in the morning sun, Yoni Asher shows me a video on his phone.It's of his two small girls, sitting on a bed. They're singing Happy Birthday. Raz, the eldest, with long fair hair, is just four years old. Her sister Aviv, darker and more like her dad, is only two."They made this for my birthday in July," Yoni tells me.But four months on, the 37-year-old father and husband is home alone. Along with their mother Doron, they were captured on 7 October in Hamas's unprecedented cross border attack. They are thought to be among the youngest of the 240 hostages being held in Gaza. "They had been visiting their grandma for the holidays in Nir Oz," Yoni says.The Israeli kibbutz sits only two miles from Gaza. It was one of the communities worst affected by the attack, with one in four of those who lived there believed to have been killed or kidnapped by Hamas.Yoni was not with his family that day. He'd stayed home for work, a hundred miles away.The first confirmation his family had been abducted by Hamas came in a video, posted on TikTok from inside Gaza. Yoni shows it to me.In the five-second clip, you can see his wife Doron, still in her nightwear crammed onto a motorised cart surrounded by Hamas gunmen.Raz is there in a pink summer dress."That's Aviv's hand," Yoni says, pointing to five tiny fingers, reaching out towards her mother.That was more than three weeks ago. Yoni has not seen or heard of his family since. Their grandma, Efrat Katz, has been found dead. Her partner, Gadi Mozes, also abducted, is missing."The only way to describe it is hell," says Yoni. "It's the definition of hell.""How can I eat when I don't know what my family are eating? How can I sleep when I don't know if they if they are cold or too hot?""As a father, if you ever saw your children jumping on the bed, or the sofa, you worry they will fall on their head. So, imagine how I feel in this situation. Everything is frightening to me."For now, all Yoni has are memories. And inside the family home, they are everywhere. Photographs and children's artwork on the wall. Tiny handprints in red paint."They loved to draw. Raz did this one for me," says Yoni, pointing to a cartoon-like figure on a pin board that's meant to look like him. "She told me it's a superhero."There's the familiar toy kitchen."They always liked to pretend to cook for me."Yoni goes on.A collection of tiny shoes is lined up in the corner amid children's books."I had to take all the batteries out of the noisy toys," he says."They are tiny balls of energy. With three women in the house, we had enough noise for any man," Yoni tells me managing to raise a smile.I ask him how he feels about the suffering in Gaza, now under Israeli bombardment for almost a month and where the United Nations says thousands of children have been killed or injured."Children are children, it doesn't matter which country they are from," he says."Children need to be off limits. I can't hate not even the children of my so-called enemies. How can you hate a child?"And what about the hostage videos that have been released by Hamas?"It was not easy to watch," Yoni replies.  "They're the ones who got kidnapped. They [Hamas] are taking advantage [of] them in a cynical and the lowest way possible, in order to make some kind of psychological battle."At 37 years old, Yoni has known the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians his entire life. His parents knew it before him.But for him, 7 October is obviously the worst moment."It's one day of Holocaust," he tells me, as he pauses to choose his words."I know it's a harsh word. But that day was the worst that was seen in the history of the Jewish people and the Israeli people."Does he think Israel can ever get over its collective trauma?"We have no other choice. It's like my own personal case. It's either fight or be dropped," he says."We have to recover. It will be very difficult. But I believe in the long term, our nation will recover."For now though, all Yoni can do is wait, hope and tell his family's story.	
01/11/2023 21:44:00	Rafah crossing: First Britons leave Gaza but others face nervous wait - BBC News	British nationals have left Gaza for the first time since war with Israel broke out last month.The UK Foreign Office confirmed an unspecified number of UK passport holders had been able to leave via the Rafah crossing into Egypt on Wednesday.It said the route was being opened for "controlled and time-limited periods" to allow some foreign nationals and injured Palestinians to leave. About 200 British nationals are believed to be in Gaza. It emerged on Wednesday that some 500 people a day would be allowed through the crossing, which is controlled by Egyptian authorities. Thousands gathered at the border this morning hoping to leave, but it emerged that only those whose names appeared on a limited list agreed by the Egyptian and Israeli governments would be permitted to cross.The UK Foreign Office said it had handed over the names of people who wished to leave Gaza. On Wednesday evening, it confirmed some Britons were among a group of around 400 foreign nationals and injured Palestinians who had crossed, but did not say who or how many.Earlier, the BBC spoke to British-Palestinian doctor Abdelkader Hammad, who was told he was in the first group allowed to leave.But when he arrived at the crossing point, he found the route was closed and described frustration and confusion at the border.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme at around 16:00 GMT (18:00 in Gaza) from the crossing point, Dr Hammad said: "It's a little frustrating. We don't know what's going on...we don't know when the next group will go - if it will be tonight or tomorrow."It's dark - I'm not sure it will happen tonight, we'll see what happens tomorrow."Speaking from the Rafah crossing at around 13:00 GMT, BBC News reporter Rushdi Abualouf said thousands of people were already at the border when it emerged only those on the list would be allowed through.With no passport control or electronic ID system in place, the process is slowed by the need for an official to manually check the identities of every person leaving, he reported.He also saw between 20 and 30 ambulances passing through the crossing carrying injured people into Egypt for medical treatment.Routes in and out of Gaza have been closed since Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group in the UK - attacked Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostage.BBC News understands that 14 British nationals were among those killed. Three more are missing.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,700 people have been killed since Israel launched air strikes as part of a military response to the attacks.The partial opening of the Rafah crossing follows international diplomatic efforts to convince Egypt to allow people to leave and aid to be transported into the enclave.Rishi Sunak held a further call with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on Wednesday evening.Speaking to the BBC at the AI summit in London earlier on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said the government was committed to getting humanitarian supplies into Gaza, and helping UK passport holders leave.He continued: "We're playing an active role in getting aid into Gaza to help those people who need it, but also diplomatically working with everyone in the region to find ways to move our British nationals out of Gaza and hopefully bring them home."Foreign Secretary James Cleverley called the first departures from Gaza a "hugely important first step". He earlier said British officials are on the ground in Egypt "ready to assist British nationals as soon as they are able to leave". Western officials told the BBC a team had been deployed to Arish, a city some 25 miles (41km) away from Rafah, to "ensure we can provide the necessary medical, consular and administrative support needed" for British nationals.Among the British nationals in Gaza are Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf's in-laws. He welcomed the opening of the border but said his wife's parents remained trapped without clean drinking water and rapidly diminishing supplies.Both Mr Sunak and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have called for humanitarian "pauses" in fighting to allow the movement of aid.Humanitarian pauses tend to last for shorter periods of time than formal ceasefires, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations.	
01/11/2023 20:57:00	'I simply don’t want to die at 24' - Gaza woman trapped at Rafah crossing - BBC News	This was their third time trying to cross. But there were reasons to hope. All the news reports said the border would definitely open. The family had been called by the Jordanian embassy and told to go to the Rafah crossing. Tala Abu Nahleh's mother is a Jordanian citizen. Foreign passport holders were going to be allowed through. So were the wounded and the seriously sick. Tala's 15-year-old brother Yazid is disabled and suffers from seizures. He can only move from one place to another with the aid of a wheelchair. The hospitals in Gaza have run out of the medication he needs, while the bombing has exacerbated his condition."Once the escalation started," Tala says, "he got very afraid, the seizures kept getting worse and worse. Every time I believe it's gotten to the worst, it just keeps getting worse." There are six in the family and Tala is the sole financial support. She won scholarships and studied in the US and Beirut, Lebanon. Confident and articulate as she is, it is easy to imagine her guiding her family through the challenges of life beyond Gaza's borders."We are trying to survive. We're not sure we're going to make it, but we're trying to do everything we can to survive, because I simply don't want to die at 24."The border is a place where the word "luck" has different meanings. It means escaping bombing, hunger and lack of water. It also means having to leave behind those you love who don't have foreign passports, or who are not badly wounded enough to merit evacuation, or who are trapped under fire and cannot reach the border. The number of those who have left, or will be able to leave, is only a tiny percentage of Gaza's population of 2.2 million people.Mona - she did not wish to give her surname - is an Australian citizen through marriage. She came to the border alone and was haunted by the thought of her family trapped in Gaza."I'm not happy at all, because I'm leaving my other part, my brothers and sisters, my whole family is still here. I wish, God willing, they would all be in a safe place. The situation is terrible there, it's very very bad," she says.Groups of men gathered in front of paper lists posted on windows on the Gaza side of the crossing. Fingers ran down lines of names seeking out those already approved for departure. Families sat on the plastic chairs of the waiting hall, a small space into which so much hope is being funnelled. Altogether, 400 foreign nationals and wounded people were able to leave Gaza on the first day of the evacuation on Wednesday. By the day's end, it was clear to Tala Abu Nahleh that her family would not be so fortunate. They went home to their apartment, dark like those of their neighbours because there is no electricity. Tala sent us a video message saying she did not know how to feel any more. She sounded and looked weary."We came back to no electricity, no food for today, no clean water to drink or even washing water. And one more day closer to my brother running out of medications, and we're still here. And it's night. I don't know if we will make it tomorrow, but I hope so."Additional reporting by Mahmoud Bassam in Gaza, and Hanin Abdeen, Alice Doyard, Morgan Gisholt Minard, and John Landy in Jerusalem.Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

01/11/2023 18:23:00	The UK nationals killed in Hamas attacks on Israel - BBC News	Fourteen British nationals were killed in Hamas's surprise attack on Israel on 7 October, the BBC understands.A further three are missing, some of whom are feared dead or are being held hostage in Gaza. The UK government has confirmed 12 deaths.The stories of those who have lost their lives are still emerging. These are the victims we have learned about so far.British-Israeli soldier Yosef Guedalia was part of an Israel Defense Forces unit sent to confront Hamas gunmen at Kibbutz Kfar Aza.His brother Asher said he "literally saved people minutes before he got shot" and described him as a "righteous and good person".He said Yosef had helped to evacuate injured people and was killed after returning to fight the attackers.The 22-year-old's mother was born in Manchester. He was due to celebrate his first wedding anniversary.British-Israeli Yonatan Rapoport was murdered in the Hamas attack on kibbutz Be'eri, southern Israel. The father-of-two, known to his friends as Yoni, leaves behind children Yosefi and Aluma.He was a fan of the Premier League football team Manchester United and was planning to go to Old Trafford - the team's home ground in north-west England - next month for his son's first game there.Last week, BBC News was shown messages from a WhatsApp group of mothers within Be'eri communicating as Hamas's attack on the kibbutz got under way.British-born Lianne Sharabi was found dead after the Hamas attack on Kibbutz Be'eri, her family told the BBC.Her two daughters - Noiya, 16, and Yahel, 13 - were missing in the days that followed. It was confirmed on 17 October that Yahel had been killed. Noiya was later confirmed dead by her family.Lianne, who was born and grew up in Staple Hill on the outskirts of Bristol. started a new life in southern Israel after marrying husband Eli. He is still missing.In a statement, their British family called Lianne the "light of our family's life".When confirming Noiya's death, they said she "embraced every opportunity to help others, particularly those less fortunate than she, and was a gifted student and linguist."Most importantly, she was an amazing granddaughter, cousin and niece. We are heartbroken she has gone, but forever grateful she was here."The 20-year-old attended north London's JFS Jewish School before moving to Israel to serve in the military. Its headteacher said the school's community was "devastated" and "heartbroken" at the news of the death.Eliot, Mr Young's brother, told the BBC: "Whenever I saw him, I always gave him a huge hug. And I will miss that smile. That hug and those laughs that we had together."Mr Young's funeral, held at Israel's national cemetery Mount Herzl, was interrupted after loud bangs were heard over Jerusalem.A crowd of more than 1,000 people were forced to run and find cover between gravestones and under trees when air raid sirens started to sound.Bernard Cowan, who grew up in Glasgow before settling in Israel with his wife and three children, was killed in the attack.Sammy Stein, chairman of Glasgow Friends of Israel, said Mr Cowan - who was a grandfather - returned to the city often and regularly visited Mr Stein's peace advocacy stall in the city centre.He told BBC Scotland that Mr Cowan lived "metres" from the Gaza barrier, adding: "It was quiet, it was peaceful and it was in the country. He loved it."Mr Marlowe was working as a security guard at the Supernova music festival, where 260 people were killed when it was stormed by militants.The 26-year-old was reported missing from the event, which took place near the Re'im kibbutz a few miles from the Gaza barrier.A friend told inews that he was a talented musician and DJ who was "happy and thriving" in Israel after relocating in 2021.He is a former pupil of north London's JFS Jewish School. When Mr Marlowe was still classed as missing, head teacher David Moody said the school community was praying for him.The family of Daniel Darlington, 34, have said they believe he is among those killed. Mr Darlington was originally from Manchester but had been living in Berlin. The photographer had been visiting friends in Israel and was travelling with a German woman. He was educated at Cheadle Hulme School, according to a memorial page. In a statement posted on Instagram, his sister referred to him as Danny and "baby brother". She said he was killed at the Nir Oz kibbutz alongside a friend.She wrote: "Only days before he was riding his bike, laughing, taking photos of sunsets and enjoying life's simple pleasures."A relative told the BBC that on the morning of 7 October, Mr Darlington was in touch with his family by text message. He was advised to lock the door and get into a shelter - but communications eventually stopped.The relative said a body was found in the room he was staying, but that he has still not been formally identified. They also said Mr Darlington had spent time in the kibbutz while in his 20s, and travelled back there each year for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. Mr Darlington had a flight to Berlin booked on the night of the attack, but had stayed longer, the relative said. The sister of Roi, Ayelet Svatitzky, said her brother was killed after Hamas's attack on Israel earlier this month.Roi, 54, was found shot dead at the back of his home, she told the BBC. "I've lost my brother, there's nothing I can do about it. All I can do is bury him," Ms Svatitzky said. Her other brother, 51-year-old Nadav Popplewell, and mother Channah Peri, 79, are some of those being held hostage by the Palestinian militant group. Ms Svatitzky was speaking to her mother on the phone when the gunmen entered her home. She said her mother's neighbours later told her they had seen the militants take her relatives. Roi, Mr Popplewell and Ms Svatitzky are all British citizens.(The identities of those killed are not being routinely confirmed by the UK authorities. Information for this article is taken from BBC interviews with relatives of the victims and public tributes from organisations associated with them.)	
01/11/2023 16:39:00	What is the Rafah crossing and why is it Gaza's lifeline? - BBC News	The first civilians from the Gaza Strip have crossed the Rafah border into Egypt since the Israel-Gaza war started.Dozens of severely injured Palestinians were taken in ambulances and hundreds of foreign passport holders made the crossing on Wednesday.Egypt said it would initially allow in more than 80 injured and more than 500 foreign and dual nationals in total, in a deal said to have been brokered by Qatar.This is the first such evacuation since the conflict began more than three weeks ago. It is not clear how long the border will stay open.It has already been open for more than 10 days to allow aid into Gaza. So far, more than 200 trucks have crossed the border, but much more is needed.It's the southernmost post of exit from Gaza and borders Egypt's Sinai peninsula.There are only two other border crossings from and into the Gaza Strip - Erez, a crossing into Israel in northern Gaza, which is for people, and Kerem Shalom, a solely commercial goods junction with Israel in southern Gaza. Both are shut. Gunmen from the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked the Erez crossing on 7 October during an unprecedented assault on southern Israel which killed more than 1,300 people. Days later, Israel declared Erez and Kerem Shalom closed until further notice, leaving the Rafah border as the only way into and out of the Strip for people. Rafah is now also the only crossing point for humanitarian aid. Hamas and Egypt exercise control over who can pass through, but operations have been disrupted since Israel began conducting waves of air strikes on Gaza in retaliation for Hamas's assault.Egyptian media said the crossing was shut down following three Israeli strikes on 9 and 10 October, which it said left injuries on the Egyptian and Palestinian sides of the border. On 12 October, the Egyptian government asked Israel to halt strikes near the Rafah border crossing so it could serve as a "support lifeline" for people in Gaza, and made it clear that it would not open the passage until there were guarantees for the safety of its staff. Three weeks later, people are gathering at the border following reports that Qatar has mediated an agreement to allow some people out of Gaza.Reuters news agency says the Gulf state has been holding talks between Egypt, Israel and Hamas, in coordination with the US.It is this deal that is allowing some critically injured people and foreign passport holders out of the Gaza Strip.Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas - which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012.Israel and Egypt have restricted the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza since Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. The two countries say their blockade is needed for security reasons.As part of its response to Hamas's deadly attack, Israel's defence minister ordered a "complete siege" of Gaza on 9 October, adding: "There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed."Meanwhile Egypt fears a massive influx of Palestinian refugees fleeing the war. Egypt's president warned on 12 October that an exodus from Gaza risked "liquidating" the Palestinian cause and called on Palestinians to "remain steadfast on their land".It is also concerned about the possibility of Islamist militants coming into the country, having faced a jihadist insurgency in Sinai for almost a decade.It is not easy for Palestinians to leave Gaza via Rafah. Palestinians wishing to use the crossing must register with the local Palestinian authorities two to four weeks in advance and may be rejected by either the Palestinian or Egyptian authorities with little warning or explanation. According to the UN, in August 2023, the Egyptian authorities allowed 19,608 exits from Gaza and denied entry to 314 people.	
01/11/2023 13:07:00	Paul Bristow sacking over Gaza letter is shameful - Islamic leader - BBC News	A Conservative MP's sacking from government after he called for a ceasefire in Gaza was "disgraceful", an Islamic leader has said.Peterborough MP Paul Bristow was told to resign after he wrote to the prime minister and said a permanent ceasefire would "save lives".Number 10 said the comments "were not consistent... with collective responsibility".Abdul-Muquaddas Choudhuri said Mr Bristow had "not done anything wrong".Mr Bristow, who will continue to sit as an MP, served as Parliamentary private secretary to the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, Michelle Donelan.He wrote to Rishi Sunak about Gaza on 26 October, following meetings in his constituency, including with Peterborough's Joint Mosques Council.Mr Choudhuri, who chairs the council, said the sacking was "absolutely disgraceful" and that he was "right calling for a ceasefire"."We are very angry – we are very annoyed about that because he has not done anything wrong," said Mr Choudhuri."It was absolutely shameful of the government of Rishi Sunak to sack him just because of what he said."Mr Bristow's letter, posted on Facebook, said there was a "great deal of sorrow and pain" among his constituents, some of whom had been "directly affected".Speaking after his resignation, Mr Bristow said: "I fully understand why the prime minister's asked me to step down."Collective government is a key part of our democracy and it was a job I really enjoyed, so I do regret that."But at the end of the day I have a wider responsibility to my constituents."Thousands of people in my constituency care very strongly about this and I feel I am better placed now to talk openly about what's going on from the back benches rather than being part of the government payroll."Mr Bristow has represented Peterborough since 2019 and has a majority of 2,580.He added that it was "awfully cynical" to suggest he was courting votes ahead of a potential election "when we're talking about people losing their lives"."Anyone who's seen me talk about human rights and talk about injustices over the many years that I've been a member of Parliament will see that it's perfectly consistent with what I've been saying," he added.Mr Sunak has supported "specific pauses" in the conflict to enable aid delivery, but his spokesperson said he did not support a ceasefire as that would only benefit Hamas, which is considered a terrorist group by the UK.A Number 10 spokesperson said: "Paul Bristow has been asked to leave his post in government following comments that were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility."Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said "calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas".Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

01/11/2023 09:08:00	Bolivia severs diplomatic ties with Israel over Gaza war - BBC News	Bolivia has become the first Latin American country to cut diplomatic ties with Israel over what it describes as "aggressive and disproportionate" military actions in Gaza.The country called for a ceasefire and said it would be supplying the blockaded Gaza Strip with aid. An Israeli official said the move was "a surrender to terrorism".Lior Haiat accused the Bolivian government of "aligning itself with the Hamas terrorist organization". Bolivia's Deputy Foreign Minister Freddy Mamani said that the government had taken the decision to cut ties "in repudiation and condemnation of the aggressive and disproportionate Israeli military offensive taking place in the Gaza Strip". He added that the country wanted an end to Israel's blockade that was preventing "the entry of food, water and other essential elements for life".Gaza has been under an Israeli siege for weeks, with essential aid only reaching people through Egypt's Rafah crossing sporadically. "Israel condemns Bolivia's support of terrorism and its submission to the Iranian regime, which attest to the values the government of Bolivia represents," Mr Haiat said in response. Iran has been accused of providing support for Hamas to carry out the 7 October attacks. While Iran's leaders have celebrated and praised the violence, they have denied involvement.Bolivia is not the only Latin American country to have begun taking diplomatic steps against Israel. Chile's President Gabriel Boric said on Tuesday he was recalling the country's ambassador in Tel Aviv for consultations "given the unacceptable violations of International Humanitarian Law that Israel has incurred in the Gaza Strip.""Chile strongly condemns and observes with great concern that these military operations - which at this point in their development entail collective punishment of the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza," he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Colombian President Gustavo Petro made a similar announcement on social media. "I have decided to call our ambassador in Israel for consultation," Mr Petro said, adding that "if Israel does not stop the massacre of the Palestinian people we cannot be there."Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva urged a ceasefire. Following reports of a new Israeli air strike in Gaza, Lula said on X: "We are seeing, for the first time, a war in which the majority of those killed are children... Stop! For the love of God, stop!"The majority of the 8,500 war deaths reported by the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza are of adults but they include 3,500 children. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the Hamas attack of 7 October that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people taken hostage.The US said on Tuesday that 66 trucks had been able to deliver aid inside Gaza, but charities warn that it will not be enough.United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa) commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini said that prior to the war, about 500 trucks would enter Gaza each day.Bolivia only restored diplomatic relations with Israel in 2019. It had previously cut ties with the country in 2009 under President Evo Morales, again to protest against Israel's actions in Gaza.On Monday, Bolivia's President Luis Arce described Israel's actions in Gaza as "war crimes" on X after meeting with the Palestinian ambassador to Bolivia, Mahmoud Elalwani. 	
01/11/2023 06:22:00	Israel-Gaza war: 'Dialogue is not easy, but we can't shut the door' - BBC News	The Muslim Jewish Forum of Greater Manchester was set up almost two decades ago, when, as one member puts it, the communities "had no communication with each other".Its aim has always been to develop cultural and social ties between the two communities in the region, something it says the Israel-Gaza war has thrown into sharp focus."It is not easy for dialogue at the moment, but we can't shut the door on it," says Manchester councillor Rabnawaz Akbar, who sits on the forum's executive committee."There is anger and frustration because it's not just about the conflict now," he says."It's about the daily images people are seeing of civilians, children, women, old people. Nobody wants to see that."At the end of the day, humanity prevails everything."Since the conflict began on 7 October, the forum has been calling for all communities "to act responsibly and to support and protect each other against any form of hatred and provocation". In a statement, it said people should "unite in remembering that what we have in common far surpasses the differences in our culture and heritage". Salford councillor Heather Fletcher, the forum's Jewish co-chairwoman, told BBC North West Tonight that "the way forward is always that people get to know each other [and] become friendly with each other, because it's ignorance that makes people intolerant"."Being familiar with people and being friendly with them and learning about each other's cultures makes people understand each other and it's understanding that's the key," she said.She said it was important to make sure the message the forum published was acceptable to all communities."Just a couple of words out of place can make the whole thing sound different or upset one community or another community," she says.David Berkley KC, a member of the forum's executive committee, said he had said to his friends from both faiths that "were it not for that unequivocal statement from the forum, I certainly wouldn't be sitting at this table today".He said the group was about "identifying those things we have in common and those things upon which we disagree"."One of the things that I think has made it possible to have an impact is our willingness to acknowledge that there was these issues, which we cannot ignore," he added."We have identified these issues and been willing to have an open and honest discussion about the things that matter to us."Mohammed Amin, the forum's Muslim co-chairman, said since it was launched almost two decades ago, he had noticed a "change in atmosphere as a consequence of our activities". "I didn't have any social contact with Jewish people as an adult," he said. "In 50 years, I had never set foot inside a synagogue and helping to set up the forum has transformed my life in terms of expanding my understanding."As far as Manchester is concerned, we made it much more normal for Muslims and Jews to do things together."Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

01/11/2023 00:21:00	Strikes on south Gaza: BBC verifies attacks in areas of ‘safety’ - BBC News	Since the Israeli military issued the first of several instructions for civilians to evacuate north Gaza, hundreds of thousands of Gazans have moved to the south of the strip. But the south has continued to come under Israeli bombardment, leading the UN and other aid organisations to warn that nowhere in Gaza is safe for civilians.To better understand the risk to civilians in south Gaza, BBC Verify has identified and analysed four specific instances of strikes in that region. We also looked at some of the warnings and evacuation instructions that were issued to Gazan civilians, including some advising them to move to certain areas in the south.Some of these warnings were accompanied by maps with arrows pointing to vaguely defined areas to move towards. Three strikes we examined hit within, or close to, those areas in the days after the warnings were issued.The IDF has said that it communicates with Gaza's residents in a variety of ways, including leaflet drops, social media posts in Arabic, and warnings issued through civilian and international organisations. In this piece we have examined the IDF's instructions posted on social media. The IDF said on 10 October that overnight its fighter jets had struck more than 200 targets in Rimal in the north, and Khan Younis in the south. The BBC has examined a strike on that day in central Khan Younis to understand the location and the scale of the damage. Video footage published in the aftermath of the attack shows rubble and collapsed buildings in the city centre. We have verified its location using visual clues such as the minaret of the Grand Mosque in Khan Younis.We have also examined photos showing destroyed buildings, and people picking through what remains of cars and homes. We know the photos show the same location as that seen in the video because the same pharmacy sign can be seen in both. We also used reverse image search to check that the photos were not from an earlier incident.On the morning of 8 October, IDF spokesperson Avichay Adrae had posted a warning on X (formerly known as Twitter) in Arabic, giving instructions to residents of various areas in Gaza to leave their homes and move elsewhere for their safety. While evacuation zones have often been clearly delineated, the destinations residents have been told to head to have often been much more vague.In this instance, those living in the neighbourhoods of Abasan al-Kabira and Abasan al-Saghira, a few kilometres south-east of central Khan Younis, were told in the 8 October tweet to go to "Khan Younis city centre." The map included in the tweeted video for those living in the two neighbourhoods highlights their current residencies, and is labelled with an arrow simply pointing in the direction of Khan Younis.  We cannot discount the possibility that there were then subsequent different instructions, but the BBC has not found any evidence of this. The BBC has verified that there was another strike the next day, further south near the border with Egypt. This 11 October strike hit Nejmeh Square in the centre of Rafah. The BBC looked at a video posted to social media showing destruction in the strike's aftermath. Using available images of the square before the attack, we were able to identify the shape of the buildings as that of Nejmeh square.The warning, issued on 8 October by the IDF, also contained an instruction for residents of Rafah, telling them to immediately go to the shelter in Rafah city centre "for your safety". The map in the video for those living in the Rafah neighbourhoods contains an arrow directing residents towards "Rafah".The BBC analysed all of the IDF social media warning posts in Arabic it is aware of in this time period. It has not been able to find evidence of any subsequent different instructions, but that does not eliminate the possibility that others were issued.Eight days on, back in Khan Younis, there was another strike - on Gamal Abdel Nasser Street. We verified this by looking at videos of the collapsed buildings in one of the city's main thoroughfares. By matching the shape of the buildings in the video, with those in other still images of the same location, we were able to verify this was the same place.Additional footage from the aftermath shows bodies of the dead and injured being pulled out of rubble and taken to nearby Nasser hospital.The IDF had issued a warning on 16 October for residents of Gaza City to move south to Khan Younis if "your safety and the safety of your loved ones are important to you". Again, there is a possibility that there were further instructions that were different, but we have not found any evidence of this.Further north, in central Gaza, there are four refugee camps. The BBC has verified strikes on two of them. Social media footage of the aftermath of a strike on al-Bureij camp on 17 October shows extensive rubble, flames, and bloodied bodies being carried out of the damage. We have verified the footage by matching up buildings in this footage with photos by news agencies of the aftermath. We also verified the footage location using a mosque that was visible.Another camp nearby, al-Nuseirat, was struck the next day, on 18 October. We have verified social media footage of the aftermath, which shows ambulances, detritus, people trying to douse flames and a destroyed bakery. We located it by matching the shop names that can be seen in the video with those seen in photos published before the strike took place. Despite the earlier 8 October warning instructing residents of the eastern and southern Maghazi area to go to camps in central Gaza, there do not appear to be any camps in the location specified on the tweet's map.We have however identified three camps nearby: al-Nuseirat and al-Bureij, hit by the strikes on the 17 and 18 October, and another camp called Deir al-Balah.We cannot discount the possibility that there were then subsequent different instructions, but the BBC has not found any evidence of this. The aftermath of another strike in al-Nuseirat camp, on 25 October, was shown on the news outlet Al Jazeera. Footage posted online shows its chief Gaza correspondent Wael al-Dahdouh in tears in hospital, holding the body of his seven-year-old daughter and kneeling over the body of his teenage son. His wife was also killed."There is no safe place in Gaza at all," he said in an English translation of an interview with Al Jazeera. He said that his family had moved from the north following Israel's warning to residents to move south for their safety.The BBC provided specific locations and dates to the IDF for each of the strikes highlighted in the article. We asked if these locations had been struck by IDF forces and whether warnings had been given prior to these attacks.In its response the IDF said it "cannot provide any further information regarding these specific locations".It said that it had "called on civilians in Gaza to move south for their safety but will continue striking terrorist targets in all parts of Gaza". It added: "In accordance with international law, the IDF takes precautionary measures in order to avoid damage to the civilian population. These measures include warnings before strikes in cases where it is possible to do so." Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.

01/11/2023 00:07:00	What China wants from Israel-Hamas war - BBC News	As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve.China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to "urge calm" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare détente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it "stands ready to strengthen communication with China" on resolving the situation in Gaza.As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. "Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table."But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. "China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution," said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East.China's first statement on the conflict angered Israel which expressed "deep disappointment" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory.After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that "all countries have the right to self-defence" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone "beyond the scope of self-defence".China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called "national liberation" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship.But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing.The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government.Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved?One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens.Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy.But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation.China believes that "standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US "hegemonic" leadership.Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is "ginning up the nationalist response… tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel," noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of "adding fuel to the fire" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaper The Global Times published a cartoon of Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands.One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its Western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position.  There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions.One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet.Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them.The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests.China assumes that "by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach," said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue.Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has "no selfish interests on the Palestinian question". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.	
31/10/2023 22:10:00	In Kibbutz Be'eri, a broken promise to keep Israelis safe - BBC News	Kibbutz Be'eri - three miles from Gaza - never felt like the frontline of a conflict. It looks like one now. Its empty streets are a canvas of rage. In the house where seven members of Gilad Korngold's family were taken hostage by Hamas, it's hard to find any sign or scrap of family life. Machine-gun fire has gouged holes across the walls; rooms are collapsed and gutted by fire; bullets have made lacework of the metal doors. "Look at this!" Gilad cries, holding back tears, as we walk inside. "How they hate us." The safe-room door held fast against the bullets, but the steel shutters outside were blown open, and his family has gone. Among them are his son Tal, daughter-in-law Adi, his eight-year-old grandson Naveh and three-year-old granddaughter Yahel. It's the first time he's seen the house, which belongs to Adi's parents, since the attack. "It'll take generations to rebuild [the kibbutz], if they build a new one," he told me. "I think a lot of people will not return." What was broken here was not just the houses, but the promise Israel made to its people that it could keep them safe, even three miles from a territory run by a group committed to Israel's destruction. "It was an illusion," said Gilad. "For 25 years, a long illusion. This is what everybody thought: we were safe here, we were strong. But after this happened, I hope somebody will wake up and start another strategy." Standing in the empty house, the twin pressures on Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are clear. Both Mr Netanyahu and his armed forces have a tough task ahead to rebuild trust in Israel's ability to protect its people. At the same time, public pressure is growing on the government to secure the return of more than 200 hostages held in Gaza, including Gilad's son, daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren. With backroom negotiations reportedly continuing, Hamas has suggested it could release the hostages in return for all Palestinian prisoners held in Israel's jails. Many relatives, including Gilad, say that Israel should do whatever it takes. But the man Israel holds responsible for this attack - the Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar - was himself released in a prisoner exchange deal 12 years ago. Mr Netanyahu faces a difficult decision: whether or not to gamble with the country's future security in order to get the hostages out now. He has already faced challenging conversations with the families of some hostages over Israel's intense bombardment of Gaza, insisting that there is no conflict between the government's two priorities of destroying Hamas and protecting the hostages. "The key is the degree of pressure," he told the families last week. "The greater the pressure, the greater the chances." But many families need convincing. Gilad said he and his family had sat up all night last week when Israel escalated its air strikes on Gaza, watching for any news of the hostages there.  It was "a terrible night", he said. Public attitudes seem to be shifting behind the hostage families. More people are joining the rallies organised by them after a widespread media campaign. And a poll by a major Israeli paper just before the ground invasion of Gaza suggested that less than a third of people supported it, down from more than two-thirds a week before. During that time, Hamas released four hostages, drip-feeding them out two by two. The unspoken message planted in many minds here was that there could be more. But early indications suggest that public opinion on whether to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange is deeply divided. The government's war aims have sparked a startling national unity over the past few weeks. Could the methods used to achieve them prove more divisive? At the families' memorial site in Tel Aviv, a new clock is ticking up the hours of the hostages' captivity. Its bright digits tick on through daytime speeches and candlelit vigils relentlessly. Around it, posters of those taken hostage by Hamas paper every wall - frozen, along with their families, in the final messages or moments from three weeks ago. Meanwhile, Israel has changed irrevocably. In Be'eri, the sounds of Israel's continued bombardment of Gaza land in the empty streets every minute or two. Cradled in the ashy scraps of garden, Gilad spots his grandson's football - preserved untouched beneath a layer of gritty soot. The buried treasure of an earlier life.	
31/10/2023 22:06:00	Jabalia: Israel air strike reportedly kills dozens at Gaza refugee camp - BBC News	An Israeli air strike is reported to have killed dozens of people at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 50 people were killed and 150 wounded. But a nearby hospital said it received 400 casualties, including 120 dead.Pictures showed several large craters, surrounded by shattered buildings.The Israeli military said the strike killed a senior Hamas commander and "underground terror infrastructure" beneath buildings collapsed afterwards.It added that a "large number of terrorists" from Hamas's Central Jabalia Battalion who had been with the commander at the time were also killed.Israeli tanks and troops, meanwhile, continued to advance towards some of northern Gaza's most populated areas, including Jabalia. Israel has said it is the "second phase" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage. Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.  Tuesday's air strike in Jabalia caused a huge explosion that destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the refugee camp, where before the war 116,000 people were living in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was "an earthquake". "I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers," he told AFP news agency.Video footage and photos showed hundreds of people searching the wreckage afterwards. "We're filling bags with children," cried one man, holding up a small white cloth bag covered in blood.AFP reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A long line of body bags were laid outside the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia. Its surgical director told the BBC's International editor Jeremy Bowen that it received 400 casualties, including 120 dead, and that the majority were children and women.Dr Mohamed el-Ron also said there were severely wounded people needing complex surgery who had to be transferred "under fire" to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.Médecins Sans Frontières quoted one of its nurses at Al-Shifa, Mohammed Hawajreh, as saying: "Young children arrived at the hospital with deep wounds and severe burns. They came without their families. Many were screaming and asking for their parents."Later, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had a carried out a "wide-scale strike on terrorists and terror infrastructure belonging to the Central Jabaliya Battalion" and killed its commander, Ibrahim Biari."The strike damaged Hamas's command and control in the area, as well as its ability to direct military activity against IDF soldiers operating throughout the Gaza Strip," it added."A large number of terrorists who were with Biari were killed. Underground terror infrastructure embedded beneath the buildings, used by the terrorists, also collapsed after the strike."IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari did not directly address the reported civilian casualties at a briefing, but he said: "The Hamas terrorists continue to use civilian population as protective armour. This is intentional and devastatingly barbaric."A Hamas spokesman was quoted by Al Arabiya TV as denying that a commander had been in Jabalia, accusing the IDF of "false and unfounded talk" intended to "justify its heinous crime".The IDF also said that its ground forces had killed about 50 Hamas fighters during an operation to secure a military stronghold in western Jabalia that served as a training centre for the 7 October attack and contained tunnels used as a passageway to the Mediterranean coast.Two Israeli soldiers were killed during the battle, according to Adm Hagari.Hamas's military wing said its fighters had hit four Israeli military vehicles within southern Gaza, fired at tanks and bulldozers in north-west Gaza, and ambushed an Israeli unit in the north-east.Hamas and other Palestinian groups also continued to fire rockets into Israel. Four people in the coastal city of Ashdod were wounded in two attacks.Following Tuesday's strike in Jabalia, Adm Hagari once again called on all civilians in the camp and elsewhere in northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.Hundreds of thousands of people have not heeded the order, which the IDF first issued on 13 October.The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients and medical staff. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools and other public buildings.On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said it was extremely concerned by reports of air strikes in the vicinity of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital over the last two days. The hospital, which is located south of Gaza City, is the main cancer centre in the Gaza Strip.The BBC verified a video circulated on social media on Monday in which smoke can be seen outside the hospital and an explosion can be heard. The Israeli military told the BBC that it had not stuck the hospital, but it did not deny that there may have been strikes in the area.Dr Richard Brennan, the WHO's regional emergency director, also warned that the wider health situation in Gaza was "essentially catastrophic", with 8,525 deaths from trauma reported by the health ministry, over a third of hospitals not functioning, and the rest overwhelmed by patients."Anaesthetics and painkillers are running short, so doctors are doing procedures without the right medicine and equipment, and patients are suffering incredible because of that," he told the BBC.Dr Brennan also said the UN had already started to see infectious diseases such as diarrhoea and respiratory infections among the 1.4 million displaced people living in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions.The US said on Monday night that it was confident there would be an increase in humanitarian aid entering southern Gaza via Egypt's Rafah border crossing in the coming days. In recent days, there has been a small rise in the deliveries of food, water and medicine being allowed in, but UN agencies said the promised 100 lorryloads a day were a fraction of what was needed. Israel is not permitting deliveries of fuel - crucial to run hospitals and bakeries, and for purifying and pumping water - because it says it could be used by Hamas for military purposes.The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf said he saw hundreds of people queuing for a small bottle of clean drinking water from a UN tanker outside a hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis on Tuesday. A father who had to queue for six hours to get five Arabic flatbreads to feed his family told him: "This is not enough." 	
31/10/2023 21:02:00	Israel Gaza: Father loses 11 family members in one blast - BBC News	There is no mistaking what he sees as he climbs across the rubble. The fabric lies bright against the grey rubble. Khalil Khader picks up the dusty and tattered child's pyjamas and is instantly overtaken by memories. The toddler in her pyjamas. Rosa, his daughter, 18 months old, the baby of the family. Khalil shows a video on his phone. Rosa wears the same blue nightwear and is holding the hands of two older cousins. The three of them dance in a circle. The video was filmed in slow motion, so it seems as if the children are swaying in a gentle breeze. They are smiling. It is playtime and their lives have not yet been overtaken by war. Khalil is a quiet spoken man, aged 36, a computer engineer at Al-Najjar hospital in Rafah, and the father of four young children: Ibrahim, aged nine; Amal, aged five; Kinan, two-and-a-half, and Rosa the last born.  Khalil steps carefully across the rubble. The house is only a few minutes walk from the hospital. There is now a mound of masonry and metal, household objects and some children's toys. A small drum. A toy piano.On the night the missile struck - October 20 - Khalil was working at the hospital. "A massive bomb exploded," he told one of my BBC colleagues who went with him to the scene of the attack. "My neighbours were coming to the hospital. So I asked, 'Where was the bombing?' And they told me, 'It was around your house.' I had to run to the location to check on the family. I tried calling but no one was answering. And as you can see… the whole house was bombed."Eleven members of his family were killed. They included his four children, his two sisters, his 70-year-old father, his brother and his sister-in-law, and their two daughters. They were wrapped in white shrouds in a courtyard of the hospital. His wife was badly wounded. She is being treated for burns and other injuries sustained when the house collapsed.Khalil had known war before in Gaza. The small strip of land - with a total land area of just 141 sq miles (365 sq km) - has seen relentless conflict over decades. Such was the legacy of conflict that he worried about raising a family there. "I remember in the 2014 war, my wife was pregnant," he recalls, "and our neighbours were bombed. She was in her seventh month and almost fell down the stairs from the blast. And I was thinking, how can I bring children into this life?"But he imagined that a better life might be possible for them.   "I had a dream for each of my kids. Ibrahim was first in his school and I dreamed about seeing him as a doctor one day. Amal was very creative, she loved drawing. And she used to show me her drawings, and sometimes I would draw with her. "Kinan was very playful - everyone loved him. And he used to take care of his little sister. He was always there to protect Rosa, and would say, 'Don't touch her, she's my baby!' And now they are all gone." Khalil is still searching for the body of his sister under the rubble. And he must support his wife in hospital. His children are gone. But as he shows one photograph after another of Ibrahim, Amal, Kenin and Rosa, there is a tenderness in his eyes. He will always be their father.Additional reporting by Mahmoud Bassam in Gaza, and Hanin Abdeen, Alice Doyard, Morgan Gisholt Minard, and John Landy in Jerusalem	
31/10/2023 21:01:00	Anti-war protesters interrupt Antony Blinken at US Senate hearing - BBC News	Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled "Ceasefire now!"Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin testified about the White House's $106bn (£87.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading "No to the siege of Gaza", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red "to symbolise blood", the group said.Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and "the passions expressed in this room" at the end of his statement."All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end," he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes:As support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request.Mike Johnson, the newly elected Speaker of the House of Representatives, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is not connected to the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes.  The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would "say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents".The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to "help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes"."Politicising our national security interests is a non-starter," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was "deeply disturbed" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his "political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans".The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service. The White House and senior American officials have reaffirmed US support for Israel numerous times since Hamas's 7 October attack."We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack," Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath.In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly.He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians.Israel says Hamas's incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October have killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's bombardment began.	
31/10/2023 20:28:00	Jack Lew confirmed as new US Ambassador to Israel - BBC News	The US Senate has confirmed former treasury secretary Jack Lew as the new US Ambassador to Israel.President Joe Biden nominated Mr Lew, an Orthodox Jew who held top posts in prior administrations, in September.The White House urged Congress to confirm him quickly after Hamas's attack, as "high-level diplomatic representation" is "critical".The Senate voted largely on party lines, with Democrats and two Republicans backing Mr Biden's choice.Mr Lew needed a simple majority in the 100-member Senate for his appointment to be confirmed.Raised in an observant Jewish family in New York, Mr Lew, 68, has maintained a low profile in Washington, D.C., despite a career that boasts several important postings. Under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the longtime civil servant led the Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the president's budget requests.Mr Lew later served for a year as President Obama's White House chief of staff, one of the most influential cabinet positions. A budget expert, he was then appointed as treasury secretary in 2013 and served in that post until 2017.That appointment process was memorable for the criticism of his illegible loopy signature, as it would appear on American currency if he became secretary. He quickly adopted a more traditional sign-off.Mr Lew began his career in politics in 1973. He worked for eight years as the primary domestic adviser to House Speaker Tip O'Neill, an iconic and powerful Democrat.Mr Lew has previously spoken in support of a two-state solution. He openly criticised Israel and its conservative prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, while working under President Obama. He also defended the US's 2016 decision not to veto the UN Security Council condemnation of Israeli settlements on occupied land.During his recent nomination hearing, however, Lew said he has "worried deeply about the survival of the State of Israel" throughout his life. Growing up, he said, his family believed deeply in the creation and defence of a Jewish homeland. That background and Hamas's attack informed Mr Lew's view of the post's important responsibility, he said."At this moment, there is no greater mission than to be asked to strengthen the ties between the United States and the State of Israel and to work toward peace in a region that has known so much war and destruction," he said in his opening statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Mr Lew said that as ambassador he would work "to end the horrific attacks by Hamas" and make sure Israel has all "it needs to defend itself". He said he would strive to help American captives return home.He also said he would do everything in his power to stop the conflict from expanding, aid innocent Palestinians trapped in Gaza, and stymie the influence of Iran, which he called "a threat to regional stability and to Israel's existence". Senate Democrats had stressed their desire to get Mr Lew into the ambassador's post, which was vacated in July, as quickly as possible. Republicans, however, expressed reservations and in some cases hostility to the appointment.Mr Lew sparred with Republicans during his hearing over his work on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Deal.The agreement, which included the UK, the US and several European countries, limited Tehran's nuclear programme. In return, Western countries and the UN agreed to eventually lift sanctions and unfreeze Iranian funds. Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he had "reservations" over Mr Lew because of his involvement in the deal as President Obama's Treasury Secretary: "Holding hands with Iran under the table doesn't work for me."Republicans have long opposed the Iran Nuclear Deal, arguing it did not do enough to ensure Tehran would not develop a nuclear weapon and gave the government too much financial support. Donald Trump famously pulled the US out the agreement early in his administration.Other Senate Republicans claimed the deal had allowed Iran to fund groups like Hamas. A few also suggested Mr Lew had misled Congress when testifying about the agreement as secretary. Mr Lew disputed the claims, arguing that all Iran gained was access to "their money that we had frozen". Iran agreed to the terms but was unhappy with the outcome, he said. 	
31/10/2023 17:26:00	Five 'dangerous' prisoners escape from Tunisian jail - BBC News	Five prisoners branded as dangerous Islamists have escaped from a jail in Tunisia.The country's interior ministry released their photos and called on citizens to provide any information they have to prevent "terrorist acts".The inmates escaped from Mornaguia prison early on Tuesday, the ministry said on its Facebook page. Ahmed Malki, imprisoned for killing two politicians in 2013, was among those who escaped, Reuters said.Also known as "the Somali", he had been serving a 24-year sentence for the assassination of secular politicians Chokri Belaid and Mohamed Brahmi, it said.The killings in 2013 plunged Tunisia into political crisis, forcing the eventual resignation of the government.The escaped prisoners also included Rayd Touati, who security sources say has taken part in the most violent attacks that have shaken Tunisia in the past decade, according to Reuters.Tunisia became the birthplace of the Arab Spring when it overthrew its long-serving ruler, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, in 2011. But it is facing increasing political turmoil as President Kais Saied has sought to seize near-total power.One of Tunisia's worst attacks happened in 2015, when a gunman opened fire on tourists staying in a popular resort just north of Sousse, killing thirty-eight people.‎‎	
31/10/2023 16:29:00	Natalie Raanan, a teen taken hostage by Hamas, is home in Chicago - BBC News	A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday.Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people.They were freed on 20 October for "humanitarian reasons", Hamas said.There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. "I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago," said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. "Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness."The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack.Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an "overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs".At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been "working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans.An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk, was confirmed dead on Monday.Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.	
31/10/2023 16:03:00	Keir Starmer says he understands calls for Gaza ceasefire - BBC News	Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the "correct position" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was "the only credible approach".He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave.He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as "deeply offensive" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally.Following his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked.He said the party was unified on wanting to see an "alleviation of this awful situation" and that he would "engage sensitively" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians "caught in the crossfire". "While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now."Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately."He said a humanitarian pause was "the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering".Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be "unwise" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions, according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also said past comments made by Sir Keir had caused hurt to Muslims and "any peace loving citizen". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: "I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire."Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as "fine words" adding: "The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. "Those calls will only get louder."Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on X: "I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now."Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show "the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs".They said calls for a pause were "vague and unclear" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire.On Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: "We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty."He said his words were intended as "a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings" in the region.But the phrase "between the river and the sea" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend "were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety".However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide, after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.	
31/10/2023 16:00:00	Israeli President Isaac Herzog defends Gaza operation - BBC News	Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting "a huge focus" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting "a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities".On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage.  Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw "terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us".Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration.  "We listen and we respect them," he said, but added that "first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it "couldn't be measured in numbers".The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that "only a trickle" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's "humanitarian catastrophe". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned "no place was safe in Gaza". "Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone," Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire.  "We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out."  Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted. Turning to the question of more than 200 hostages, including dozens of nationalities, held by Hamas, Mr Herzog said it was Israel's top priority, as well as the international community's, to bring them home.   But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as "the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. "My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment," he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. "Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward." "This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?" 	
31/10/2023 12:58:00	Keir Starmer walks political tightrope on Gaza - BBC News	In his speech on Gaza, Sir Keir Starmer sought to lift his sights beyond the immediate conflict by focusing, in part, on a future Labour government's commitment to a two-state solution - Israel and a viable Palestinian state existing side by side.This is in line with the Labour leader's oft-stated aversion to short-term fixes and "sticking plaster politics" - the Middle East's problems, he argued, have not received enough attention from the international community.Conveniently, this position allowed him to distance himself from the right-wing Israeli PM, Benjamin Netanyahu.It also allowed him to stress that there was widespread agreement in his own party on the longer term goal.But his speech didn't - and couldn't - ignore not just the current conflict in the Middle East but the conflict in his own ranks.And he is facing considerable jeopardy.He has to walk a political tightrope - balancing support for Israel against Hamas with the need to respond to growing calls for a ceasefire.He explained why he is backing a humanitarian "pause" - in line with the EU and US, to allow for more aid - rather than a ceasefire, which he said would embolden Hamas and allow them to plan future attacks.  But crucially, his tone towards pro-ceasefire voices in his own ranks was tolerant - saying that he understood what was driving them.He may have little choice in this, as otherwise he'd have to sack 14 shadow ministers who come from across Labour's political spectrum, and some of whom represent substantial Muslim communities.His tone towards the Israeli government was also more sceptical.He denounced illegal settlements in the West Bank, and said Israel's right to self defence was not a "blank cheque".While he signalled that pro-ceasefire frontbenchers seemed to be safe from the sack, Sir Keir, of course, suspended the former shadow minister Andy McDonald from the parliamentary party - which has outraged the left. But the bigger danger is that by not straying from his opposition to a ceasefire - at least "at this stage" - some shadow ministers beyond the left come under renewed pressure from members and communities to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction.So far the policy of engaging with, rather than eradicating, dissent has maintained a degree of unity.And no-one in any of the top positions in the party has strayed from the leader's line.But the situation in the wider party is volatile - and opponents will be keen to highlight any divisions.So the reaction to Tuesday's speech will be important.It will determine whether a fragile unity can be maintained, or if it will splinter or shatter.	
31/10/2023 12:43:00	Inquiry after officer seen removing posters of kidnapped Israelis - BBC News	An investigation has begun after a community police officer was filmed removing posters of kidnapped Israelis.The footage was captured in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, an area known for its large Jewish community.Greater Manchester Police's chief constable admitted the force "got it wrong". Stephen Watson said he was "very concerned" about the footage and the force's professional standards department was looking into it.It comes as a relative of an Israeli man among the 239 hostages abducted by Hamas criticised the Metropolitan Police after posters were also removed in London.The Prestwich footage, which emerged on Monday night featuring a PCSO, was shared on social media, prompting widespread criticism. Mr Watson told BBC Radio Manchester there was "no malicious intent" but admitted the force had "responded badly".He said: "It runs entirely contrary to the instructions that we have given to our officers in terms of dealing with this."There were a series of complaints about the posters and the PCSO, under instruction, removed the posters so there's nothing malicious in the intent of the officer. "We have responded badly to a complaint and I think we've got it wrong."Israel has been taking military action in Gaza since the Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in southern Israel.The Hamas-run health ministry has said more than 8,000 people have been killed.In a statement, Assistant Chief Constable Wasim Chaudhry said he shared the concerns about the posters' removal and confirmed an investigation was under way. "The action taken last night, in response to complaints, is contrary to guidance that the force had already issued to staff in relation to flyposting," he said. "We will continue to work with local authorities and the community to ensure posters can be displayed. We regret any offence caused."Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

31/10/2023 11:34:00	British Jews are 'full of fear, like I've never seen before' - BBC News	"The Jewish community at the moment is full of dread, full of fear, like I've never seen before," says Justin Cohen, news editor and co-publisher of Jewish News.He talks of this anxiety playing out with a backdrop of intense trauma caused by the Hamas killings and kidnappings on 7 October.More than 70% of British Jews have family living in Israel and 90% have visited the country at least once, according to the Institute for Jewish Policy Research.But the fact the Metropolitan Police reported a 15-fold increase in antisemitic incidents over the past three weeks, when compared with the same period last year, means hatred has been at the forefront of the minds of many."If people who are so boiling over with rage in these demos see Jewish people as inextricably linked with Israel, they will inevitably target those Jewish people. The fears are never-ending at this point," says Mr Cohen.The demonstrations in the UK, attended by tens of thousands of people calling for an end to Israel's bombing of Gaza, have been viewed by him as hostile, threatening and unsettling.In the most recent marches, he points to some being filmed calling for "intifada", the term given to violent Palestinian uprisings."We've seen calls for an intifada where, in the past, suicide bombings have targeted civilians, in cafes and restaurants and in nightclubs. Whether it's one person saying this stuff or 10 or 10,000, the chilling effect on British Jews is the same," says Mr CohenAlthough protest organisers insist the focus has been on Israel's massive bombing campaign in Gaza - and that antisemitism has not played a part - that is not how many British Jews see the marches."It's chilling. It's upsetting. And it makes you feel unsafe in the place that you call home," says Londoner Benjamin Bell, 41, of the size of the pro-Palestinian gatherings.In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, Mr Bell wrote a blog post that went viral in which he publicly expressed his Jewish identity, after years of being cautious about doing so, because of concerns about antisemitism. He talked of wearing a star of David pendant for the first time since his bar mitzvah.Three weeks later, Mr Bell says he is once again having to weigh up whether he wears that pendant depending on the situation."Unfortunately a lot of social media content is stirring up hatred and making people feel that the place that they call home may not be safe," he says.Mr Bell talks of Jewish friends feeling anxious about antisemitism, particularly at work where they are worried about expressing support for Israel.Although  he was born and raised in the UK, he says he was profoundly affected by the killings and kidnappings in Israel."The Holocaust cast a long shadow over the Jewish spirit and we feel that the state of Israel provides that sanctity, that safe haven, that last resort - it goes to the very heart of my being," he says.It is why Mr Bell says he feels unnerved by the demonstrations and particularly by the use of slogans like "from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free," referring to the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. He feels it can only mean the destruction of the Israeli state in its current form.The Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which helps organise the demonstrations, contests this interpretation of that particular chant, saying the slogan refers to "the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice".Activists also point to the make up of the pro-Palestinian protests as evidence they are not antisemitic."There are hundreds of Jews on the demonstration. In fact, I've never experienced the more beautiful energy. I saw no hate, just a kind of a wonderful caring for humanity," says Alexei Sayle who is both Jewish and also a patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.The 71-year-old actor, comedian and author - whose mother was Jewish and grew up in an Orthodox, Yiddish-speaking household - has been a long-time campaigner for Palestinian rights. It is a contingent that represents a small minority of British Jews.Mr Sayle says Jews who choose to publicly criticise Israel's actions sometimes feel a sense of guilt and often pay a price for their stance."It's cost me friendships, it's made relationships with people difficult, sometimes it's made me feel uncomfortable to speak out for the Palestinian people. It's painful," Mr Sayle says.Referring to the "river to the sea" chant, he insists it is not meant to mean the eradication of Jews in the region. But while he fully understands the need for Jews to have somewhere they feel safe, he acknowledges that he, and other campaigners, are calling for a change in the way Israel sees itself as a Jewish country."I think that to have a state called Israel, which has a right of return and is a state in which Jews live in beautiful harmony with everybody else, is fine," Mr Sayle says."But if that safe haven depends on brutalising other people, stealing other people's land, then it's not a safe haven," he says, challenging Israel's assertion that its actions are necessary to maintain security.While there is debate over the nature and intent of some slogans at demonstrations, a huge rise in incidents of anti-Jewish hate in the UK of the past few weeks is irrefutable. Similar spikes in antisemitic incidents accompanied Israel-Gaza violence in 2009, 2014 and 2021."We are unfortunately used to it to some extent, but we do feel that we should be feeling safer here in England, children should feel comfortable to come to school in the morning and not get harassed," says Abraham Schechter, headteacher of the Beis Chinuch Lebonos Jewish Girls School in north London.Staff and students arrived at school one morning to find red paint had been thrown at the front gates. Another Jewish school close by was also vandalised in a similar way."Everybody's very tense, very worried, especially the pupils. We had discussions telling them not to loiter around on the streets and just to go straight home [after school], but they should not suffer here for what is happening over there," Mr Schechter says.There are concerns that the longer the conflict goes on, the more intensely and profoundly it will affect British Jews right across the spectrum.Additional reporting by Harry FarleyHave your family or friendship groups had disagreements over the Israel-Gaza war?

31/10/2023 11:34:00	Anguished UK Palestinians grieve for loved ones in Gaza - BBC News	It was 04:30 on Sunday 22 October when Ahmed Alnaouq suddenly woke. He normally slept well, but he'd had a feeling something was wrong.He glanced at his phone and saw lots of WhatsApp messages from friends back home in Gaza - all now erased and replaced with "This message has been deleted." Mr Alnaouq, confused, messaged one of them back from his home in London. The response - "Are you good?" with no explanation for the deleted texts - made him feel more uneasy. Ahmed called, and his friend broke the news. Mr Alnaouq's father Nasri, three sisters, two brothers, a cousin, and 13 young nieces and nephews - 20 members of his family - had been killed by an Israeli air strike. He felt something worse than devastation - a feeling so awful he didn't have a word for it. His father, he said, was the person he "loved most in his life".  Most of the family had lived together in his father's home, where Mr Alnaouq himself was born. His three sisters had moved in temporarily for their own safety, because the house was south of the Wadi Gaza river. But shortly after ordering civilians to shelter in the south, the Israeli military continued to target the area. It said it was striking a series of Hamas targets."Israel instructed people to go there because it was safer," Mr Alnaouq said. "Then they bombed it."Ahmed Alnaouq moved to the UK four years ago after getting a scholarship to study for a master's degree at the University of Leeds. He now runs the organisation We Are Not Numbers, which pairs Palestinian writers with mentors in the West. He hadn't been able to see his father since leaving Gaza."I always said to myself that if something happened to my father before I was able to see him again, I would never forgive myself."For Mr Alnaouq, he has not just had his family ripped away - he has also been denied the ability to grieve."Usually when someone loses a family member, they will be able to go and attend their funeral, kiss them goodbye, see their faces for the last time," he said. "But they are thousands of miles away. Still, after a week, nine of them are under rubble. No-one can take their bodies out from under the rubble. I don't know how to describe it, but I feel like my heart is torn."He is one of many British Palestinians who, despite being 2,500 miles (4,000km) from Gaza, are feeling the war intensely. Those whose relatives have survived the bombings are trying to track their family members' movements remotely, and to push for action from those in power. They're watching the war unfold on TV and their phones, while trying to remain hopeful that their loved ones are safe. Basma Ghalayini, 40, is one such person. She is currently dealing with the intense anxiety of not knowing how her relatives are faring. Ms Ghalayini is in Manchester, but her brother and sister travelled to Gaza in September to visit their parents who work there.   When Hamas launched their attack on southern Israel on 7 October, Ms Ghalayini's mother was immediately concerned about the potential dangers to Basma's sister, who has a health condition and is reliant on certain medication. "So she quickly took [my sister] to the Egyptian border and headed to Cairo. They made it through. The borders closed the very next day." Ms Ghalayini's brother Mohammed and their father stayed in Gaza, moving to Khan Younis in the south when Israel gave its evacuation order. Aside from the risk of deadly rockets, water and food supplies are running extremely low. The UN has warned that civil order is "starting to break down". Power in Khan Younis is also extremely limited. Ms Ghalayini said Mohammed had had to queue for five hours to charge his phone from a car battery. For this reason, she said, she doesn't want to waste her brother's battery by texting him a lot. Instead, she asked him to switch on his "last seen" status on WhatsApp. But that connection is fragile. On Friday evening, Israel launched strikes of a scale and intensity never seen before. Connectivity from Gaza was cut off almost completely. Their loved ones in the UK waited anxiously for Gaza's internet to return. It was then another 42 hours before Ms Ghalayini finally heard from Mohammed.While this is the most intense escalation of the conflict in recent years, for Palestinians and the diaspora, the pain they're feeling now is not new. Ms Ghalayini told me her six-year-old daughter and three-year-old son already know what bombs are. "It's all part of being Palestinian," she explains. "Any Palestinian child will know, because it's part of our lives."But when her daughter asks if her uncle and grandfather are safe, she tells her, "Yes, they're safe." "I have to," she said. "She'll just get worried."Karim Ali's colleagues literally bear the scars of Israel's previous attacks on Gaza. The 24-year-old from London works with a para-cycling team based in Gaza called the Gaza Sunbirds. Everyone in the team lost their limbs in previous bombardments. He said that he had been talking recently to one of the athletes who had been gathering body parts from those killed in the current violence."We're talking about an amputee on one leg having to go around to gather the body pieces of people from the building next door, because there's no one else to clear the rubble."There's also a feeling of frustration closer to home. Ms Ghalayini said she feels let down by the UK media, including the BBC. She said she disagrees with some of its terminology, such as it sometimes referring to the "Israel-Hamas war"."It's heavily misleading," she said, as thousands of Palestinians had been killed, including children - "none of them affiliated with Hamas". Mr Ali said he feels his community isn't always treated with respect by politicians or the media, citing what he sees as their tendency to make Israel's attacks on Gaza seem "justified and targeted"."We're doctors, we're teachers, we're lawyers, we're politicians, we're academics, we're volunteers," he said. "I came to this country to study, I started a food bank, I started a mutual aid group during the pandemic. I've contributed to the culture of this country. "Why are we being treated like we're nothing? Why are we being dehumanised?"But for both Ms Ghalayini and Mr Ali, the overwhelming show of support from people who've gone on marches across the country has left them with some hope. While Basma Ghalayini worries they risk being a bit of an "echo chamber", she said the marches help her feel "reassured"."It makes me feel that there are people who are there for us, supporting us." 	
31/10/2023 10:40:00	Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza tells of 'terror' for family - BBC News	A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was "murdered with her whole family", including five children."Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed," he said.After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel "left alone" by the government.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in "close contact" with British nationals in Gaza.The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out.He said he was "terrified" they would be killed before they manage to escape.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.The doctor and his family arrived in Gaza three days before the attacks. When the crossing border was closed, they became "trapped".Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was "the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing"."It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary."The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in."We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place," the doctor said."For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe."Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area," he said, adding that has become very usual to hear."In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed."Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack.The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south, two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board."They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out," he said.The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office "on the second day to get some help" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him "to go online and fill a form"."I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed," he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily.The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire.The doctor called for an "immediate ceasefire" to allow aid in, amid an "imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes".An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza "can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible". It added: "FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''	
31/10/2023 10:36:00	Deep divisions ahead of crucial UN climate talks - BBC News	There are already signs that deep divisions could hamper progress at the UN's crucial COP28 climate summit.More than 70 environment ministers and 100 national delegations have been meeting in Abu Dhabi ahead of talks that begin in Dubai on November 30.Many delegates doubt that a summit hosted by a petrostate - the United Arab Emirates - can shepherd the world towards a low carbon future.This year is on track to be the hottest ever recorded globally.That makes the urgent need for action clearer than ever.The president of the COP28 conference, Sultan Al Jaber, acknowledged the challenges he faces."We must find common ground, ensure consensus and resolve differences," he urged in his opening speech. But Mr Al Jaber is himself a deeply divisive figure.He is also the head of Adnoc, the UAE's state oil company and one of the largest oil producers in the world.Adnoc pumped 2.7 million barrels of oil per day in 2021, according to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec).Greta Thunberg described his appointment as "completely ridiculous" and said it called into question the entire UN climate process.The COP conferences "are not supposed to lead to a dramatic reduction in CO2 emissions," she told me at a rally in London recently. "If they were then they would not put an oil executive as the president."Not surprisingly Mr Al Jaber takes a very different view. He says climate change can only be solved if oil and gas are part of the discussion and argues his experience in the industry makes him the ideal person to push for action.In Abu Dhabi this week Mr Al Jaber was at pains to lay to rest any doubts about his ambitions for the main talks. He restated that the key goal would be keeping the world on track to limiting temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.  Scientists say that should provide a good chance of avoiding the worst impacts of climate change.And Mr Al Jaber accepted that achieving that will require deep emissions cuts."We need solid solutions for a 43% cut in emissions by 2030, because that is exactly what the science is telling us," he said.But for many in the audience that commitment rang hollow, not least because Mr Al Jaber's oil company has bold expansion plans over the same period.It plans to increase capacity by 600,000 barrels a day by 2030 and is spending $150bn in the process.Mr Al Jaber has justified the expansion saying the world will still need some oil and gas even as emissions fall - something the UN's climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has acknowledged.He says in that situation oil and gas from the UAE should be the amongst the world's first choice, because barrel for barrel it is some of the lowest carbon oil to produce - although it creates the same amount of CO2 when it is actually burnt.Arguments like this help explain how the UAE and other oil producing nations including Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US justify talking about the need to "phase down" fossil fuel production rather than phasing it out completely, given the CO2 they produce is the key source of greenhouse gas emissions.The European Union is part of a loose coalition of about 80 nations that take a much tougher line.  They say there can be no compromise on getting rid of fossil fuels. "Our ambition is to really phase out fossil fuels ASAP and have language that does justice to that cause", says Wopke Hoestra, EU Commissioner for Climate Action. Mr Al Jaber says he knows it is going to be hard to reconcile the "strong views" between nations on this crucial issue and urged the delegates in Abu Dhabi to do their best to find "common ground".But there is deadlock on other issues too. One of the big achievements of the last UN climate conference was to get global agreement to set up a "loss and damage" fund to help poor nations pay for the consequences of climate change.But preparatory talks on how to set up such a fund and who might run it have already broken down and there are fears big polluting nations like the US could walk away from the discussions altogether.Mr Al Jaber says he is desperately trying to get the negotiations back on track and this week announced the UAE would host an additional meeting of the committee responsible.Even on issues where there is consensus, getting agreement at COP28 could prove elusive.One of the UAE's key objectives for COP28 is to get the world to treble renewable energy capacity to 11,000GW by 2030.Most major economies are already on board with that goal.The G20, which represents the world's biggest economic powers and includes China, the United States and India, agreed to a major ramp up of renewables at a meeting in September.However, some European nations and climate-vulnerable states have said they will only sign up to a commitment to clean energy if there is also agreement on phasing out fossil fuels.These deep differences on core issues show just how difficult progress is likely to be when the COP28 conference begins on November 30.It is very different from the heady optimism that greeted the signing of the Paris Agreement just eight years ago and reflects a fundamental change in the agenda of the talks.Paris was about getting the nations of the world to agree in principle that they needed to work together to fight climate change.These talks are now about getting countries to actually take action - a much trickier challenge.What is clear from the meeting in Abu Dhabi this week is that when the main talks begin they are likely to be driven in large part not by a desire to protect the planet from global warming but by international rivalries, domestic politics and squabbles about cash.	
31/10/2023 07:25:00	Reporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry' - BBC News	The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel.  In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away.  Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes.When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. "As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message," he says, "sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent."Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love.The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. "I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing," he tells me, "but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need." Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. "This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza," says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. "We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit."In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war."I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer," she says. "He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. "He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza."Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

31/10/2023 04:34:00	Israel Gaza: US rejects calls for ceasefire - BBC News	The US has rejected global calls for a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas, arguing it is not the "right answer right now".National Security spokesperson John Kirby made the comments on Monday, suggesting instead "pauses" to allow aid to be delivered inside Gaza.Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low.But Israel has vowed there will be no ceasefire until Hamas is dismantled. "Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism... this will not happen," Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.Speaking at a press briefing, Mr Kirby said he was confident more aid trucks would be able to enter Gaza via Egypt.He said the US had spoken to the Israeli government about increasing the number of lorries crossing the border each day to around 100. About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed."We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough," he told the press briefing.Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, previously told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had entered Gaza before the war started.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago. Last week, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly called for an immediate humanitarian truce between Israel and Hamas, which was angrily dismissed by Israel.On Monday, Mr Lazzarini said the system to provide aid would "fail unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs".Israel began what Mr Netanyahu called the "second stage" of a war intended to destroy Hamas on Monday, with ground forces expanding their operations inside Gaza after three weeks of intense bombardment.	
30/10/2023 23:16:00	US rejects Putin claim that West organised anti-Jewish airport mob - BBC News	The US has dismissed as "absurd" claims by Russia that an anti-Israel riot at a Dagestan airport on Sunday was organised by Ukraine and the West.In a televised meeting on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the incident had been part of an attempt to spread "chaos" in Russia. Hundreds stormed the Makhachkala airport ahead of the arrival of a flight from Tel Aviv, Israel.Many waved Palestinian flags and chanted antisemitic slogans.Dagestan, a constituent republic of Russia, has a majority Muslim population, and the incident is thought to have been sparked by anger over the conflict in Gaza. Security forces eventually brought the situation under control, and more than 60 people have since been arrested, according to local authorities. "The events in Makhachkala last night were instigated through social networks, not least from Ukraine, by the hands of agents of Western special services," Mr Putin told a meeting of Russia's Security Council. "Who is organising the deadly chaos and who benefits from it today, in my opinion, has already become obvious. "It is the current ruling elites of the US and their satellites who are the main beneficiaries of world instability."Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that "against the backdrop of TV footage showing the horrors of what is happening in the Gaza Strip - the deaths of people, children, old people - it is very easy for enemies to take advantage of and provoke the situation". The governor of Dagestan, Sergei Melikov, also said the riots had been incited "from the territory of Ukraine by traitors" using a Telegram channel called Morning Dagestan. Morning Dagestan is an Islamist channel that opposes Russian control of the region and has been associated with Ilya Ponomarev, a former Russian MP who defected to Ukraine in 2016 and was granted Ukrainian citizenship.On Sunday, the channel posted the details of a flight arriving in Makhachkala from Tel Aviv and told its followers to "meet the unexpected visitors".Following Mr Melikov's comments, the channel posted a statement saying it had no connection to Mr Ponomarev or Ukraine. Mr Ponomarev has said he stopped supporting the channel last year, although his own statements in recent months contradict this claim. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has condemned the airport riot.Asked about Russia's claims at a White House briefing, John Kirby, spokesperson for the US National Security Council, described them as "classic Russian rhetoric". "When something goes bad in your country, you blame somebody else," he said."The West had nothing to do with this. This is just hate, bigotry and intimidation, pure and simple."He also said comparisons between footage from the airport and the pogroms of the late 19th and early 20th century were "apt". Video circulated widely on social media showed a large crowd of people storming through the airport, forcing open doors and spilling out onto the runway. Some were also seen stopping cars outside and demanding to see the passengers' documents in an apparent search for Israeli passports. Russia's health ministry said 20 people, including some police officers, had sustained injuries and that two were in a critical condition.After the incident, Mr Melikov said that "all Dagestanis empathise with the suffering of victims by the actions of unrighteous people" but described the events at the airport as "outrageous". A statement from the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli government viewed "with utmost gravity attempts to harm Israeli citizens and Jews anywhere"."Israel expects the Russian legal authorities to safeguard the well-being of all Israeli citizens and Jews wherever they are and to take strong action against the rioters," it said.	
30/10/2023 21:34:00	Andy McDonald: Labour suspends MP after speech at pro-Palestinian rally - BBC News	Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made "deeply offensive" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. The MP for Middlesbrough used the phrase "between the river and the sea" in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. Critics of a chant which contains the phrase argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel.But Mr McDonald said his words were intended as "a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings" in the region. He will now sit as an independent MP, pending an investigation.In his speech at a demonstration on Saturday, Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: "We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty."The phrase "from the river to the sea" refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the chant as an "expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world". Israel and most Jewish groups agree.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman has said the phrase is "a deeply offensive chant to many."Mr McDonald said he was "saddened" by his suspension and believed it would be overturned after he explained his views to the party's investigation. In a statement, he said there had been "a number of misrepresentations of my words in the media", which had "furthered baseless and extremely harmful accusations against me".He added that his words "should not be construed in any other way than they were intended, namely as a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence".A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend "were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety"."The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Andy McDonald, pending an investigation," the spokesperson said.Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the suspension was "unjust" and "absolutely nonsensical". "He turned a slogan some are concerned about into a peace plea," Mr McDonnell added. Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, branded Mr McDonald's suspension "an appalling and opportunistic attempt from the Starmer leadership to silence those speaking out in solidarity with Palestine".The Labour Muslim Network described the suspension as "obscene and deeply offensive". "The fundamental right to live in peace, with liberty and self determination is one which should be applied to all peoples," the group said in a statement."The only conclusion that can be drawn is that those who have made this decision do not see Palestinian and Muslim life as deserving of this fundamental principle."Mr McDonald's suspension follows days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza.In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.But dozens of Labour councillors, and senior figures including mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and some frontbenchers, have called for a formal ceasefire.The Conservatives have had their own party discipline issues over the Israel-Gaza war, with a ministerial aide earlier being sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country "will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas"."Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas," Mr Netanyahu said.Meanwhile, the home secretary has described those who have joined protests in support of Palestine as taking part in "hate marches". "We've seen now tens of thousands of people take to the streets following the massacre of Jewish people, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map," Mrs Braverman said."To my mind there is only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches."Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs Braverman of using "rhetoric carelessly in a way that makes the job of the police much harder". "Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime and the glorification of terrorism need to face the full force of the law," she said. "At the same time, work is needed to rebuild community cohesion, to recognise the distress people are feeling about the Hamas attacks and the humanitarian emergency in Gaza, and to pull communities together at this difficult time."Hamas gunmen killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, after Israel launched a war intended to destroy Hamas.Hamas is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, meaning it is an offence to belong to or support it.	
30/10/2023 20:52:00	Paul Bristow: Ministerial aide sacked after call for Israel-Gaza ceasefire - BBC News	A ministerial aide has been sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Downing Street said Paul Bristow had made comments which "were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility". In a letter to the prime minister last week, Mr Bristow said "a permanent ceasefire" would save lives and allow aid to reach those who needed it most. The government supports "humanitarian pauses" but not a full ceasefire. During Prime Minister's Questions last week, Rishi Sunak said "specific pauses" would allow more aid into Gaza but he rejected calls to back a ceasefire, stressing that Israel had a right to defend itself. Mr Bristow, who is the Conservative MP for Peterborough, was a Parliamentary Private Secretary - the lowest rung of the ministerial ladder - to Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology.After being sacked by Mr Sunak, he told the BBC: "I completely understand the PM's decision. And it is with regret I leave a job I enjoyed. "But I can now talk openly about an issue so many of my constituents care deeply about.  "I believe I can do this better from the backbenches rather than as part of the government payroll."A Downing Street spokesman said: "Paul Bristow has been asked to leave his post in government following comments that were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility."Collective responsibility is the convention that all members of the government must publicly support government policy, even if they personally disagree with it. A large number of opposition MPs have backed calls for a ceasefire but very few Conservative MPs have. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to support a full ceasefire, with senior figures including London mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers supporting one. So far, Sir Keir has only backed humanitarian pauses, aligning him with the position of the UK government, as well as the US and EU. Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country "will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas"."Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas," Mr Netanyahu said.In his letter to the prime minister on Thursday, Mr Bristow, wrote: "My constituents and I are deeply grieved by the heart-breaking and devastating humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Gaza. "Thousands have been killed and more than one million now displaced."It is difficult to understand how this makes Israel more secure or indeed makes anything better."He added that some of his constituents had been directly affected by the conflict.Posting the letter on Facebook, he wrote that ordinary Palestinians "should not suffer collective punishment for the crimes of Hamas". Collective punishment is prohibited under international law. Around 18% of people in Mr Bristow's Peterborough constituency are Muslim, according to the latest census.It is a marginal seat, which he won from Labour with a majority of 2,580 at the last general election.Meanwhile, Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made "deeply offensive" comments  in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rallyIsrael has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.	
30/10/2023 20:22:00	Tank seen on key Gaza road as Israeli forces push deeper into north - BBC News	Israeli forces have pushed deeper into the northern Gaza Strip, with tanks briefly cutting an evacuation route to the south, Palestinian witnesses say. One tank was filmed on Salah al-Din Road, sparking speculation it could be part of an advance on Gaza City.A video showed a car turning around after approaching the tank, which seems to open fire and destroy it.  Later, Israel's military said a soldier being held hostage by Hamas was rescued in an overnight ground operation.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the freeing of Pte Ori Megidish, who was said to be "doing well", as an "exciting achievement" that expressed Israel's commitment to release the more than 230 other hostages. He also condemned as "cruel psychological propaganda" a video released by Hamas that showed another three Israeli women in captivity in Gaza demanding he agree to a prisoner exchange. The hostages - who include dozens of children and elderly people, as well as soldiers - were taken by Hamas gunmen during an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed. Over the weekend, Israel began what Mr Netanyahu called the "second stage" of a war intended to destroy Hamas, with ground forces expanding their operations inside Gaza after three weeks of intense bombardment.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,300 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low.Mr Netanyahu has also rejected calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, saying that to pause military operations would be "to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism"."Today we draw a line between the forces of civilisation and the forces of barbarism," he told a news conference on Monday. "Israel will stand against the forces of barbarism until victory. I hope and pray that civilised nations everywhere will back this fight."Aid agencies have constantly called for a pause in the fighting in order to send aid to the besieged territory.The video showing the tank on Salah al-Din Road was posted by photojournalist Yousef Basam, who drove northwards in a car on Monday morning. Basam's car is seen coming to a stop just after an intersection known as Netzarim Junction, which is 2.8km (1.75 miles) from the perimeter fence with Israel and about 3km south of Gaza City. He then zooms in on a second vehicle that is slowing down in front of what looks like piles of earth in the middle of the road and a stationary tank.The tank starts to move while the second vehicle carries out a three-point turn. A flash is then seen coming from the direction of the tank just before the car is hit by an explosion. "He's gone, the whole family is gone," shouts one of the men inside Basam's car, as it speeds away and returns southwards.A photographer who was in the area following an air strike told the BBC: "Suddenly I looked back and I saw Israeli tanks." He took a couple of pictures and then fled.The Israeli military's chief spokesperson was asked specifically about the tanks at a briefing and declined to give more information."We have expanded our operations, involving armour, infantry, and offensive actions within the Gaza Strip. This is done to achieve the two primary objectives of the war, which are countering Hamas and securing the return of the kidnapped individuals," Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said."While I cannot provide specific details here, I can assure you that the security of our forces remains our top priority."Earlier, the Israeli military said tanks and troops had continued to expand their ground operations inside Gaza overnight, killing dozens of Hamas fighters barricaded in buildings and tunnels. Air and artillery strikes had hit another 600 "terror targets" over the previous 24 hours, including weapons depots, anti-tank missile launching positions and hideouts, it added.The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern city of Khan Younis, said the incident on Salah al-Din Road was significant because Gaza was effectively cut in two for a period. He also said there had been fewer air strikes in the south in the past day, with Israeli forces appearing to be focusing on the advance into northern areas.About 600,000 people are still believed to in the north despite the Israeli military ordering them to evacuate and head south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.The UN has said 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders despite sheltering thousands of patients and 117,000 displaced people. It has warned that the evacuation of hospitals is impossible without endangering patients' lives.About 400 patients and 14,000 displaced people are believed to be inside Al-Quds Hospital, in Gaza City's southern Tal al-Hawa district, where witnesses say the Israeli bombardment in recent days has been intense. Fresh strikes were reported near Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City on Monday, where staff have said it is impossible to carry out an Israeli order to evacuate thousands of displaced civilians sheltering there as well as hundreds of patients, some of them on life support.The Palestinian Red Crescent posted a video that it said showed further air strikes near the hospital on Monday morning. The director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, which is south of Gaza City, also said it had been damaged by an Israeli strike in the vicinity on Sunday night. There is similarly concern for patients and staff at Gaza City's biggest hospital - Al Shifa - where the situation has been described as "catastrophic" by its chief of surgery.Dr Marwan Abusada said in a voice note to the BBC on Sunday afternoon that 55,000 displaced people were "occupying each square metre" of Al-Shifa and that it was "overwhelmed" by patients. About 100 patients were moved to other hospitals over the weekend, he said. "But still we are receiving many, many, many cases. Each half an hour, we receive a huge number of injured people."The Israeli military has accused Hamas of deliberately basing itself near, or even within, public buildings like hospitals. Hamas has rejected that allegation. The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC that civilians sheltering inside hospitals and UN facilities like schools must be protected by all parties under international law. "The reality is that many people in the north can't move because they physically do not have the transportation, they don't have the means," he said.He also warned that the looting of flour, hygiene supplies and other items from Unrwa warehouses in central and southern Gaza on Sunday was an indication not only of people's desperation at going without food and safe drinking water, but also of how "the social fabric of Gaza is starting to break". Mr White also said the arrival of another 33 aid lorries from Egypt on Sunday, carrying food, water and medical supplies, was "not going to meet the requirements of Gaza". "We need hundreds of trucks moving into Gaza every day," he added. "But what we are very concerned about now is that the public sector and the private sector will collapse."	
30/10/2023 18:27:00	Israel's Netanyahu condemns 'cruel' Hamas video of Israeli hostages - BBC News	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has condemned as "cruel propaganda" a video released by Hamas showing Israeli hostages taken during the 7 October attacks. The clip, released on Monday, shows three Israeli women, one of whom berates Mr Netanyahu and calls for the release of the hostages.Hamas seized at least 230 hostages in the attacks and at least 1,400 Israelis were killed. Only four have so far been released. Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, saying the aim is to destroy Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.The video of the hostages was released by the armed wing of Hamas, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.We do not know anything about the conditions under which it was filmed.Only one of the hostages addresses the camera throughout the clip.We will not publish the video. Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law, and the BBC does not broadcast material which may have been filmed under duress.In a statement, Mr Netanyahu said: "This is cruel psychological propaganda by Hamas-Isis [so-called Islamic State]."We are hugging the families. We will do everything to return all the kidnapped and missing people home."He also named the hostages as Elena Trupanov, Danielle Aloni and Rimon Kirsht."I hug you," Mr Netanyahu said.Ms Aloni's five-year-old daughter, as well as her sister and brother-in-law and their three-year-old twin daughters, was also kidnapped on 7 October. At a news conference on Monday, Ms Aloni's father said his heart had "nearly stopped beating" when he saw her picture. He called on the Emir of Qatar, who has served as a key mediator in the hostage talks, to "make every possible effort to bring them home".On 21 October, two weeks after the initial attacks, Hamas released two hostages, mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan.The group said the pair, who have US-Israeli citizenship, were freed for "humanitarian reasons".Two days later, another two women, Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifschitz, 85, were also freed. Both are Israeli but were released into Egypt.Hamas said again that it had freed them on humanitarian and health grounds, but claimed Israel had refused to receive them. Both women's husbands are still being held.It is no accident that the only images of the hostages we have seen since their violent abduction have been of women.There is absolutely no doubt that the release of the footage is designed to play on the emotions of all Israelis in ways that are likely to make Mr Netanyahu's situation even harder.He is already under enormous pressure from the families of hostages to do more to release their loved ones. Two days ago, he said this was his second priority, after the need to destroy Hamas.In the video, Ms Aloni delivers a furious attack on Mr Netanyahu's alleged failure to protect civilians on 7 October.Even if it was uttered under conditions of extreme duress, it plays into an anguished debate in Israel about how the government and the military allowed any of this to happen.At a separate news conference on Monday, Mr Netanyahu said he felt the "anguish" of the hostages' families, but insisted that ground action represented the best chance of freeing them. "Hamas will not do it unless they're under pressure. They simply will not do it. This creates pressure," he said. 	
30/10/2023 15:10:00	Dagestan: Mob storms Russian airport in search of Jews - BBC News	Israel has urged Russia to protect "all its citizens and all Jews" after a large mob shouting antisemitic slogans stormed a Dagestan airport.Video footage on social media showed an angry crowd running through the airport in Makhachkala seeking people arriving on a flight from Tel Aviv.Some of the crowd ran on to the runway and surrounded aircraft there.Russia's aviation agency Rosaviatsia said security forces later brought the situation under control.The airport was closed on Sunday night. On Monday, Rosaviatsia said the airport had reopened. The agency added that flights from Israel to the North Caucasus would be "temporarily redirected to other cities".Sixty alleged mob participants have been arrested, Russian news agencies say, citing the local interior ministry.Video clips showed hundreds of people storming the airport terminal, with some waving Palestinian flags.Many in the crowd shouted antisemitic slogans, while others chanted "Allahu Akbar" - God is greatest.Video posted on social media showed a mob rampaging through the terminal, asking staff where the "Jews" were. An Israeli passenger told Ynet that rioters stopped a bus carrying passengers and asked every person if they were Muslim or Jewish. "It was lucky that the Israelis on the plane spoke Russian," he said. "I saw death on that bus."One passenger, who said he was on the flight from Tel Aviv, told local media that he was stopped by the crowd. He said he was let go after rioters told him: "We are not touching non-Jews today."A local Telegram channel encouraged people to gather at the airport at the time of the flight's arrival and encouraged participants to search for every Jewish person there. Local media reported that some demonstrators were stopping cars outside Makhachkala's airport demanding to see documents.Twenty people were injured, including some police officers, the republic's health ministry said. Some have serious injuries and two are in critical condition.Dagestan is a mainly Muslim Russian republic in the North Caucasus, home to some 3.1 million people on the western edge of the Caspian Sea. Its government said a criminal case had been opened for civil disorder.The rabbi of the Dagestani city of Derbent, Ovadia Isakov, told local media that the future of the estimated 300-400 Jewish families in Dagestan was in doubt. Jews have had a presence in the region since pre-Islamic times. The Israeli prime minister's office said Russia had to act decisively against incitement to violence against Jews and Israelis.A US presidential spokesperson, Adrienne Watson, said in a tweet that "the United States vigorously condemns the antisemitic protests in Dagestan". "The US unequivocally stands with the entire Jewish community as we witness a worldwide surge in antisemitism. There is never any excuse or justification for antisemitism," the White House National Security Council spokesperson said.Dagestan's government voiced support for Gaza, but appealed to citizens to remain calm and not take part in such protests. There have been widespread protests internationally against Israel's bombing of Gaza.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov blamed the riots on "outside interference" of "ill-wishers". He provided no evidence for his claim. Dagestan's governor, Sergei Melikov, denounced the mob invasion of the airport, in a post on messaging service Telegram."There is no honour in hurling abuse at strangers, searching their pockets looking for their passports!" he wrote. He condemned "attacks on women with children".The mob's actions, he said, were a "stab in the back" for Dagestani patriots, including those fighting in Ukraine in the Russian armed forces."What happened at our airport is outrageous and should receive the appropriate assessment from law enforcement. This will be done," he wrote.Israel's foreign ministry said the Israeli ambassador in Moscow was working with Russian authorities, adding that Israel "views gravely attempts to harm Israeli citizens and Jews anywhere"."Israel expects the Russian law enforcement authorities to safeguard all Israeli citizens and Jews, whoever they may be, and to take robust action against the rioters and against the unbridled incitement being directed at Jews and Israelis," the ministry statement said.On Saturday, a crowd in the city of Khasavyurt in Dagestan gathered outside a hotel where they believed some Israelis were staying.The protesters threw stones at the windows and a sign was put on the door reading: "Entrance strictly forbidden to citizens of Israel… (Jews)."Later police reportedly let some into the hotel so they could see for themselves that no Israelis were there.Dagestan is not the only region in the North Caucasus that has been dealing with unrest. A Jewish centre in the republic of Kabardino-Balkaria was set on fire over the weekend. Akhmed Dudayev, Chechnya's information minister, has appealed to people not to "follow the lead of provocateurs". "We cannot allow the incitement of ethnic hatred! Remain vigilant and do not allow yourself to be misled!" he wrote on Telegram. 	
30/10/2023 13:55:00	Shani Louk: Woman missing after Hamas attack is dead, says mother - BBC News	The mother of Shani Louk, an Israeli-German woman thought to have been kidnapped by Hamas gunmen at a music festival in Israel, says her daughter is dead.Speaking to German media, Ricarda Louk said she had been told by the Israeli military that a DNA sample taken from part of a skull bone proved to be Shani's. Her body has not yet been found. Shani's sister also confirmed the death on social media. Adi Louk wrote on Instagram on Monday that Shani had been killed in the "massacre at Re'im" - a reference to the attack staged by Hamas in southern Israel, near the Gaza Strip, on 7 October.But it was not clear from the reports where or when the fragment of her skull had been found.Israel's foreign ministry wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that it was "devastated" to have to share the news of her death.The 22-year-old had been attending the festival near the Kibbutz Re'im when gunmen opened fire and sent terrified partygoers fleeing through the desert.More than 260 people were killed, the Israeli authorities said, while others were taken hostage.Soon after the attack, a video began circulating widely on social media, showing the body of a young woman being paraded through the streets in the back of a flatbed truck, surrounded by armed fighters and others yelling "Allahu Akbar" (God is Greatest).The woman was lying face down but Ms Louk's family say they identified her from her dreadlocks and distinctive tattoos.While there was speculation online and in the media that she was dead, Ms Louk's mother said at the time she believed her daughter was alive. "We were sent a video in which I could clearly see our daughter unconscious in the car with the Palestinians and them driving around the Gaza Strip," Ricarda Louk said in an appeal for information posted online. Speaking to the German TV news channel RTL/ntv on Monday, Ricarda Louk said she now assumed her daughter had been dead since 7 October and may have been shot in the head during the Hamas attack. "At least she [Shani] didn't suffer," she said, adding that it was good to have certainty. More than 1,400 people were killed in the attacks by Hamas, according to the Israeli authorities, but there has been a delay in identifying some people due to the poor condition of some of the bodies. More than 220 are thought to have been taken hostage and four people have been released.Meanwhile, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began. 	
30/10/2023 13:54:00	Armita Geravand: Iran rights activist held at metro death teen's funeral - BBC News	Leading Iranian human rights activist Nasrin Sotoudeh has been violently arrested at a funeral of a teenage girl who died after an alleged altercation with morality police, her husband says.Reza Khandan told BBC Farsi his lawyer wife was taken by security forces to a detention centre near Tehran on Sunday, Armita Geravand, 16, collapsed on a Tehran metro train on 1 October.Activists accused morality police of assaulting her for not wearing a hijab, but authorities insisted she fainted.Armita died on Saturday after "suffering from brain damage", state media said.Many Iranians have drawn parallels with the case of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who died in custody in September 2022 after being detained by morality police in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab "improperly".Anti-government protests, which are still taking place, erupted across the country when Amini died after three days in a coma. Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands detained in a violent crackdown by security forces.Mr Khandan told BBC Farsi that his wife and a number of other people were arrested during Sunday's funeral near the capital.Ms Sotoudeh, 60, has represented a number of women arrested for appearing in public without covering their hair.In recent years, she has been arrested and charged several times.  Mr Khandan also said that among those detained on Sunday was Manzar Zarrabi, who lost several family members when a Ukrainian passenger plane was shot down by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) shortly after take-off at Tehran airport in 2020.Mr Zarrabi's son Alborz Sadeghi wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that his mother was "severely beaten" before her arrest.Iranian authorities have not publicly commented on the reported beatings and detentions.However, the country's Fars news agency, which is linked to the IRGC, reported that Ms Sotoudeh "had been arrested and handed over to judicial authorities" for "not wearing a headscarf" and "disturbing society's mental security".Covering the head in public has been compulsory for women in Iran following the 1979 Islamic revolution.	
31/10/2023 02:00:00	Dozens reported killed in Gaza refugee camp blast - BBC News		
29/10/2023 15:36:00	UN: Thousands in Gaza break into warehouses in search of aid - BBC News	Thousands of people in Gaza have broken into aid depots to take supplies in what the UN called a "worrying sign of civil order starting to break down".The UN relief agency for Palestinians (Unrwa) said warehouses holding basics like flour and soap were ransacked.The news comes as Israel intensifies military action against Hamas in Gaza.More than half of the Strip's 2.4 million inhabitants have been displaced and thousands of buildings have been destroyed, the UN says.Hamas gunmen launched unprecedented attacks on Israel from Gaza on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking 230 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out strikes and now ground operations in Gaza, where the Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed.Unwra said its second largest depot - located in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip - was targeted on Saturday as it holds most of the humanitarian aid delivered by the UN.People took flour, wheat and hygiene kits after storming this and several other storage facilities in the centre and south of Gaza, the agency said.A senior spokeswoman for the UN World Food Programme (WFP), Abeer Etefa, told the BBC that the raids on warehouses were "expected" because of the "difficult conditions facing people"."The bottom line is that people are desperate, they are hungry," she said. Some of the displaced Gazans who took items from the UN warehouses told AFP news agency they had "no flour, no aid, no water, not even toilets".  Gaza resident Abdulrahman al-Kilani said: "Our houses were destroyed. No one cares about us. We appeal to the people of the world. All international powers are against us. We needed aid, and we wouldn't have done this if we weren't in need."Very little aid, and no fuel, has been allowed to enter Gaza since the attack by Hamas. Israel says it is concerned that supplies will be used by Hamas to continue the conflict.But officials on Sunday indicated that Israel would allow more aid into the strip in the coming days.In a video statement posted on social media, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said humanitarian aid from Egypt and the US would be expanded into Gaza on Sunday, without elaborating further on the details.However spokesman for Egypt's foreign ministry, Ahmed Abu Zeid, accused Israel of "obstructing" aid deliveries by implementing cumbersome security checks.Meanwhile,  UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the situation in Gaza was growing more desperate by the hour."More than two million people, with nowhere safe to go, are being denied the essentials for life - food, water, shelter and medical care - while being subjected to relentless bombardment. I urge all those with responsibility to step back from the brink," the UN chief said.	
29/10/2023 11:44:00	BBC's Cardiff building graffitied during Palestine protest - BBC News	A woman has been charged after the word "liars" was daubed on BBC Wales' office during a pro-Palestine protest. Demonstrators gathered at the Aneurin Bevan statue on Queen Street in Cardiff before heading down St Mary Street toward the BBC's office on Saturday.One of the attendees called the protest "fairly spontaneous", saying it involved a number of different groups.Cardiff University lecturer Joey Whitfield said the protesters wanted to see an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.Deidre Murphy, 69, from Swansea, has been charged with criminal damage and is due to appear at Cardiff Magistrates' Court on 14 November, South Wales Police said on Sunday.The Cardiff demonstration was one of a number taking place across the UK and follows a recent upsurge in conflict between Hamas and Israel.Israel has expanded its strikes, three weeks after Hamas launched a cross-border attack that killed 1,400 people and saw 229 people kidnapped as hostages.Since then, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 7,500 Palestinians have been killed as Israel carried out retaliatory strikes.Mr Whitfield said, roads were blocked before the demonstrators sat down in front of the BBC's building in Central Square.He said names were held up of people killed in Gaza since bombing began and chants that called "for a ceasefire, a free Palestine".Sammie, a Palestinian Jordanian who attended, said: "This is not only a Palestinian issue, it is a human issue."The BBC declined to comment.	
29/10/2023 11:30:00	Netanyahu meets Israeli hostages' families anxious over Gaza war plans - BBC News	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met families of Israelis held hostage by Hamas, who have expressed concern about the intensifying attacks on Gaza.The Missing Families Forum said the night when troops moved into northern Gaza had been "the worst" so far.They complained about the impact of a ground operation on the well-being of the 230 hostages.Mr Netanyahu has promised to do everything possible to bring them home.Ahead of the meeting, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said their relatives "are anxious about the fate of their loved ones and are waiting for an explanation" of the Israeli military's actions.In response to the statement, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said he would meet representatives of the group on Sunday. During the meeting, Mr Netanyahu said that recovering the hostages was an "integral" part of the military's goals. "Pressure is key. The greater the pressure the greater the chances," he said.The hostages were taken by Hamas gunmen during an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed.After the meeting, Hamas said Israel would have to release all Palestinian prisoners to secure freedom for the hostages.Mr Netanyahu said the idea of a swap deal involving hostages for prisoners had been discussed within the Israeli war cabinet but declined to give details.At a separate news conference, Mr Gallant said Hamas had to be forced to the negotiating table but it was "very complex"."The more military pressure, the more firepower and the more we strike Hamas - the greater our chances are to bring it to a place where it will agree to a solution that will allow the return of your loved ones," Mr Gallant told a news conference. Those in captivity in Gaza include dozens of children and elderly people, as well as military personnel. At least 135 are foreign or dual nationals, including 54 Thais, 15 Argentines and two Britons, according to the Israeli government. Hamas - which is designated as a terrorist group by Israel, the UK and other powers - has so far released four hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. Two elderly Israeli women were freed on Monday, while an American-Israeli woman and her daughter were freed on 20 October.There had been speculation before Friday night's ground operation that Qatar-brokered negotiations over another release deal were accelerating. But Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Saturday that there was "a deliberate desire of parties with interests, led by Hamas, to make cynical exploitation, psychological terrorism, and to influence our population which is in such a sensitive situation". "Most importantly, when we have the information, we will provide it," he added. "Returning the hostages home is a supreme national effort. And all our activities, operational, intelligence, are aimed at realizing a goal."Released hostage Yocheved Lifschitz, an 85-year-old grandmother who was kidnapped alongside her husband Oded from Kibbutz Nir Oz, told reporters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday that she "went through hell". She described being hit by sticks on the journey to Gaza and being taken into a huge network of underground tunnels that "looked like a spider's web".  Mrs Lifschitz also said that most of the hostages were being "treated well".   On Thursday, the spokesman for Hamas's military wing, Abu Ubaida, said around 50 hostages had been killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza. He provided no evidence and it was impossible for the BBC to verify the claim. But the Israeli military has repeatedly said it has bombed Hamas's tunnels.	
28/10/2023 22:06:00	Gaza sees heaviest night of Israeli bombardment since start of war - BBC News	Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have experienced the heaviest night of Israeli bombardment since the war with Hamas began three weeks ago.Hamas-run authorities said hundreds of buildings were destroyed in air and artillery strikes, and that at least 377 people were killed in the past day.Israel's military said its warplanes hit 150 underground targets, including tunnels and other infrastructure.Tanks and troops also went into the Strip and clashed with Hamas fighters.The military said some soldiers would remain in the field, as Israel's defence minister declared that the war had entered a "new phase".Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had entered the second stage of the war with Hamas.He said additional Israeli ground forces have gone into what he called "that stronghold of evil" - referring to Gaza - to "dismantle" Hamas and bring hostages home."This will be a long and difficult war," Mr Netanyahu added.Israel began its bombing campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by hundreds of Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which 1,400 people were killed and 229 taken hostage.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 7,700 people have been killed in the territory since then, and the UN is warning that a "humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding".On Friday night, huge explosions lit up the sky as the Israeli military said it was "operating powerfully on all dimensions in order achieve the goals of the war", with "ground forces... expanding their operations". At the same time, Palestinian mobile phone and internet networks went down, cutting off communications both inside the Strip and making it difficult to get accurate reports out.Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said it was fighting Israeli troops in the north-eastern town of Beit Hanoun and the central Bureij area, and that it had also fired barrages of rockets towards Israel.On Saturday morning, the BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, described a scene of total chaos on the ground.He said the bombardment of northern areas was on a scale he had never seen before. There were fewer strikes in southern areas, he added, but there was panic among the hundreds of thousands of people sheltering there after being told by Israel to leave their homes in the north.The Israeli military said warplanes struck 150 underground targets in northern Gaza belonging to Hamas - which Israel, the UK and other powers class as a terrorist group - including "tunnels, underground combat spaces and additional underground infrastructure". Later, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant declared: "Last night, the earth in Gaza shook. We attacked above the ground and under it. We attacked terrorist operatives from all levels everywhere. "The directives to the forces are clear: the operation will continue until further notice."Gaza Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal told AFP news agency that "hundreds of buildings and houses were completely destroyed and thousands of other homes were damaged" in the Israeli strikes, adding that they had "changed the landscape" of northern Gaza.Photographer Shehab Younis posted a video on Instagram showing a badly wounded man being rushed out of a building and put into the back of a truck because there was no ambulance.He told the BBC in a voice note that the situation was "catastrophic", with people unable to contact emergency services because all means of communication were down.William Schomburg, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross sub-delegation in Gaza, told the BBC that hospitals had been operating non-stop to deal with the casualties."I've been able to visit different hospitals, including the Al-Quds hospital, and the scenes there are difficult to describe," he said. "Healthcare workers that are operating around the clock while also dealing with a lot of personal tragedy. I spoke to one doctor who had lost his brother and cousin the night before." Mr Schomburg said healthcare facilities had also been transformed into centres for displaced civilians "who fear that the only safe place for them is on a hospital floor".The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa - which is hosting more than 600,000 of the 1.4 million people who have fled their homes - said that it lost most contact with its teams during what it described as the "worst and most intensive night" of bombings so far. "The breaks in communications are making our work... extremely challenging," spokeswoman Juliette Touma said. "We have lost so far 53 colleagues and are terrified that the number might have increased given the bombardment overnight."UN Secretary General António Guterres said he was surprised by the intensity of Israel's strikes."I was encouraged in the last days by what seemed to be a growing consensus... for the need of at least a humanitarian pause in the fighting to facilitate the release of hostages in Gaza, the evacuation of third country nationals and the necessary massive scale up of the delivery of humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza," he said."Regrettably, instead of the pause, I was surprised by an unprecedented escalation of the bombardments and their devastating impacts, undermining the referred humanitarian objectives."Israel also cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack. It has allowed 84 lorries carrying aid to cross from Egypt over the past week, but the UN has called that a "drop in the ocean". About 500 aid lorries per day were coming into Gaza before the war began.There have been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations.Israel refuses to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also accuses Hamas of hoarding fuel. 	
28/10/2023 21:55:00	Israel recalls diplomats from Turkey in Gaza row - BBC News	Israel has recalled diplomats from Turkey after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused it of behaving like a "war criminal". He made the comments while addressing thousands of demonstrators at a pro-Palestinian rally in Istanbul. The Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen responded by ordering diplomats to return.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has "the most moral army in the world".Israel has expanded its strikes on the Gaza Strip, three weeks after Hamas launched its attack on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking 229 people hostage.Since then, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 7,500 Palestinians have been killed as Israel carries out retaliatory strikes. Addressing a crowd of several hundred thousand Palestinian supporters on Saturday, the Turkish president said "the main culprit behind the massacre unfolding in Gaza is the West"."Israel has been openly committing war crimes for 22 days, but the Western leaders cannot even call on Israel for a ceasefire, let alone react to it," he said.He accused Israel of behaving like a "war criminal" and accused it of trying to "eradicate" Palestinians.He continued: "Of course, every country has the right to defend itself. But where is the justice in this case? There is no justice - just a vicious massacre happening in Gaza."It follows posts from the Turkish leader earlier on Saturday on X, formerly known as Twitter, in which he said the latest escalation had targeted "innocent civilians" and worsened Gaza's humanitarian crisis, adding: "Israel must immediately stop this madness and end its attacks". Moments after President Erdogan finished his remarks at the rally, Israel's Foreign Minister Mr Cohen said on X: "Given the grave statements coming from Turkey, I have ordered the return of diplomatic representatives there in order to conduct a re-evaluation of the relations between Israel and Turkey."Israeli Prime Minister Mr Netanyahu later said: "Don't accuse us of war crimes. If you think that you can accuse our soldiers of war crimes that is hypocrisy. We are the most moral army in the world."He added the Israel Defense Forces is taking precautions to protect civilians, and accused Hamas of committing crimes against humanity by "using their people as human shields".The two countries have a history of tense relations.Once close allies, Turkey broke off diplomatic ties with Israel in 2010 after 10 pro-Palestinian Turkish activists were killed in clashes with Israeli commandos who boarded a Turkish-owned ship trying to break Israel's maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip.Relations were restored in 2016, but they expelled each other's top diplomats in 2018 in a dispute over Israel's killing of Palestinians amid protests on the Gaza-Israel border.Turkey does not consider Hamas a terrorist organisation - unlike countries including the US and UK. It has long hosted its members and supports a two-state solution.	
28/10/2023 19:16:00	The messages of fear that trickled out while Gaza was disconnected - BBC News	A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated.Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background."The situation is very dangerous," he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight.The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations.Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a "collapse in connectivity" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured.On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages.In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday.But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday.That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. "Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort," he said."Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones."Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as "brutal"."We didn't expect that we would see morning," he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit "streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach".The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris.In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler.In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance.Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck.In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as "catastrophic"."We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured," he said."When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas."Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was "standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts.The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population "in grave danger". "Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble," UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said. "Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation." On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, "disconnected from the planet".Additional reporting by Muath Al Khatib	
28/10/2023 18:37:00	We don't know if our family is dead in Gaza - Humza Yousaf - BBC News	Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf says he does not know if his family is alive or dead in Gaza, as it remains under a communications blackout.He reiterated his plea for a ceasefire as thousands in Scotland joined pro-Palestinian rallies in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.Mr Yousaf's parents-in-law have been trapped in the territory since the deadly attacks by Hamas in Israel.It has been hit by intense air strikes after Israeli tanks entered on Friday.Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland they had not heard from them since Friday morning, before the magnitude of the bombing increased.Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband Maged - the parents of Mr Yousaf's wife Nadia - had travelled to Gaza to see a sick relative.He said: "We are desperately worried, and to be frank, we don't know if they are alive or dead."That's the reality facing many people across the world who haven't heard from their loved ones who are trapped in Gaza and have been facing bombardment over the last three weeks."The first minister said the people of Gaza were being "collectively punished for a crime they did not commit"."We need a cease fire and we need one now," he added."My wife is numb, I'm trying to do my best to give her some hope and keep ourselves distracted, we are trying to call as many relatives as we can across Gaza with no luck."This morning I listened to my four-year-old daughter pretending she was to phone her granny, and asking when she will come back."Civilians in Gaza are cut off from the outside world with phone lines and the internet down for most people.Israel has said the war with Hamas has entered the next stage with its "best soldiers" now on the ground in Gaza.Mr Yousaf's comments came as thousands of protestors took to the streets of Scotland calling for an immediate ceasefire.Similar demonstrations took place in many UK cities including Manchester, Belfast and London - where more than 1,000 Metropolitan Police officers were deployed.Speaking the rally in Glasgow, Dr Ibrahim Khadra, a Palestinian academic who works at Strathclyde University, told how 42 of his family members had been killed.He said many of his cousins and uncles has died, adding that he had lost contact with his brother and mother. Dr Khadra said: "It has been hard for Palestinians who lives outside Palestine and Gaza. We lost communication with them, we don't know anything - whether they are alive or not."On my personal level, in the last 22 days I lost 42 of my family - if I have to count friends the number goes much higher than that." He added: "Many like me have a similar story to tell."We're trying to do our best even though as Palestinians we feel helpless, there is not much we can offer our people other than demonstrating."The people who are suffering is not us, it is the people on the ground."Over the last three weekends huge protests have taken place in major UK cities.The latest rallies come as Israel expanded its strikes, three weeks after Hamas launched a cross-border attack which killed 1,400 people and saw 229 people kidnapped as hostages. 	
28/10/2023 18:26:00	Israel has no plan for Gaza after war ends, experts warn - BBC News	Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to "change the Middle East." Joe Biden has said there's "no going back." But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next?After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically.But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved."You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after," says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre.Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun."You need to do it right now," he says.Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear."There absolutely isn't a fixed plan," one told me.  "You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy."Military plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes."I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces," says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad.Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase."It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that."A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. "De-Baathification", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. "I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq," Dr Milshtein says. "For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen."Palestinians agree. "Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation," says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. "If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza."That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948."Fleeing means a one-way ticket," says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. "It doesn't mean coming back."Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza."They should cross the border to Egypt," he says, "temporarily or permanently."Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine.It says: "This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs."To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined "safe areas" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be "an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to… migrate to Egypt."Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them?"That's the million dollar question," says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia.It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means "riding in on the back of an Israeli tank".And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives."People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen," she says."You might find a few collaborators," she says, "but the Gazans will not take kindly to them."Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire.Hamas representatives, he says, were "on the other side of the street," with Egyptian officials shuttling in between.A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price."I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home."Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely."It's like a bone in our throat."	
28/10/2023 22:07:00	Belfast rally in support of Palestinians hears calls for Gaza ceasefire - BBC News	About 3,000 protesters gathered in Belfast city centre for a rally organised by the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign on Saturday. It follows the upsurge in conflict between Hamas and Israel in the Middle East in the past three weeks.A number of pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrations have been held in Belfast since the violence erupted.On Saturday protesters gathered at Writer's Square to show their support for the Palestinian people.They then walked along Royal Avenue to the City Hall.Rallies also took place in other parts of the UK, including London, Manchester and Glasgow.The demonstrations came as Israel expands its strikes on Gaza from land, sea and air, three weeks after Hamas launched an attack on its territory.Hamas launched a surprise assault on Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 220 hostages.Since that attack, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says the Israeli bombardments have killed more than 7,600 people.Speakers at the Belfast rally included Sinn Féin's Declan Kearney, the SDLP's Paul Doherty, the Green Party's Anthony Flynn and Gerry Carroll from People Before Profit.A handful of protesters briefly heckled Mr Kearney, claiming Sinn Féin should be more robustly challenging the US government's policy on the Middle East. One man shouted: "This a defining moment for Sinn Féin."Stewards asked for respect for all speakers and the heckling stopped.Mr Kearney, Sinn Féin's national chairperson, later defended his party's policy on the Middle East.He told BBC News NI: "Sinn Féin's position is consistent on Palestine and has been for decades. We stand with the Palestinian people, we stand in solidarity with them."What the Palestinian people need to hear from Belfast today is an unequivocal assertion that there must be an immediate unconditional ceasefire and an urgent resolution of the humanitarian catastrophe which is taking place."His party colleague, North Belfast MP John Finucane, spoke at Saturday's rally in London. Calling for an immediate ceasefire and the return of hostages, Mr Finucane said the Israeli government "must grant access and safety to the UN and other humanitarian agencies to fulfil their duties"."Our message to the Israeli government is clear and simple - stop. Stop the bombing of Gaza. Stop the blockade of Gaza," he added.The first speaker at the Belfast rally was Dr Hani Mahdi, who works in the city and has family in Gaza.Dr Madhi told BBC News NI that 13 members of his extended family had died in Gaza in recent weeks."I don't know what's going on with my remaining family members because the communication in Gaza is cut off," he said."We need there to be a ceasefire, we need there to be peace."Another speaker was the Rev Bill Shaw, an ordained Presbyterian minister who now leads a community development organisation in north Belfast.In Dublin, several thousand people gathered beside the United States embassy on Saturday in protest at US support for Israel, accusing it of complicity in Israeli attacks on Gaza, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reports.The protests follow similar rallies in Britain and Ireland last weekend.	
28/10/2023 13:35:00	Israeli troops clear Gaza areas 'slice by slice', but is this an invasion? - BBC News	Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there.I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on.Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about "payback". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation.Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile. 	
28/10/2023 12:31:00	At least 32 dead and 63 injured in Egypt car crash - BBC News	At least 32 people have been killed and dozens more injured in a crash involving multiple vehicles in Egypt, the health ministry has said.The collision occurred on Saturday morning in Egypt's Beheira governorate on the Cairo-Alexandria road, 131km (82 miles) north of the capital Cairo.At least 63 people have been injured, the health ministry said.State newspaper Al-Ahram said the crash involved a passenger bus and several cars, some of which caught fire.It said many of those killed were burnt to death.At least 20 ambulances were sent to the crash site, the health ministry said in a statement.Health minister Dr Khaled Abdel Ghaffar said the wounded were transferred to a hospital in Wadi al-Natrun, while others were takento Al-Nubaria.Traffic collisions are common in Egypt.

28/10/2023 10:36:00	Armita Geravand: Iranian girl who collapsed on Tehran metro dies - BBC News	A teenage Iranian girl who fell into a coma after an alleged altercation with morality police earlier this month has died, state media and activists say.Armita Geravand, 16, collapsed after boarding a Tehran metro train on 1 October.Activists accused morality police of assaulting her for not wearing a hijab, but authorities insisted she fainted.She died on Saturday morning after "suffering from brain damage", according to state news agency Irna.Borna news agency, which is affiliated with the youth ministry, said Armita had died after receiving 28 days of "intensive medical treatment".There was no immediate confirmation from Armita's parents.But Norway-based human rights group Hengaw, which focuses on Iran's Kurdish ethnic minority, said it had received a report that Armita had "become the latest victim of forced hijab and has died after 28 days of hospitalisation".It called for an independent medical team from Médecins Sans Frontières and the International Committee of the Red Cross to investigate her death."The Islamic Republic of Iran has attempted to distort the narrative surrounding the government's involvement in her death," the group said.Many Iranians have drawn parallels with the case of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who died in custody in September 2022 after being detained by morality police in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab "improperly".Anti-government protests, which are still taking place, erupted across the country when Amini died after three days in a coma. Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands detained in a violent crackdown by security forces.Irna's report on Saturday said that Armita Geravand had "hit the back of her head against the edge of the platform" when she collapsed at Tehran's Shohada station."Unfortunately, she went into a coma for some time after suffering from brain damage. She died a few minutes ago," it added.Hengaw alleged that Armita "fell into a coma after an assault by special officers enforcing compulsory hijab".However, the managing director of the Tehran metro has previously denied that there was "any verbal or physical conflict" between Armita and "passengers or metro executives".CCTV footage released by Iranian authorities shows Armita, with her hair uncovered, boarding a train with two other girls. Moments later, one of the girls backs out of the train and bends down.She and several other passengers are then seen carrying an unconscious Armita by her arms and legs before laying her down on the platform.No footage from inside the train or the entrance to the station was released.A photo of Armita that Hengaw posted on social media two days after she collapsed showed her lying on her back in a bed with a bandaged head and attached to what appeared to be a breathing tube.Armita was declared brain dead last Sunday. Her father Bahman Geravand told Hengaw at the time that doctors had said there was "no hope of recovery".Hengaw said that the teen had not undergone any operations since being admitted to hospital as her condition was considered too fragile.  	
28/10/2023 01:43:00	People in Gaza uncontactable and all communication down as Israel intensifies bombing - BBC News	There's been intense Israeli bombardment of Gaza by air, heavier than in previous evenings, while all internet and phone communications appear to be out in the territory. Israel has confirmed its forces are expanding their ground operations.The internet monitoring service Netblocks posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, to say there had been a "collapse in connectivity".The Palestinian Red Crescent says it cannot speak to its teams in Gaza."We are deeply concerned about the ability of our teams to continue providing their emergency medical services, especially since this disruption affects the central emergency number '101'," they wrote in a post on X.Meanwhile sirens alerted people in southern Israel to rocket fire from Gaza.On Friday, the Israeli military again told Gaza City citizens to move south after announcing the expansion of its military operation. In a press conference, spokesman Daniel Hagari said the military had "increased the attacks in Gaza. The air force widely attacks underground targets and terrorist infrastructure, very significantly"."In continuation of the offensive activity we carried out in the last few days, the ground forces are expanding the ground activity this evening."Currently we can't get hold of people in Gaza with communications still down. For example the BBC tried to send a WhatsApp message at 6.40pm local (nearly three hours ago) - it still just has a single tick meaning it hasn't been received by the person's phone. Mobile phone call attempts just get an unobtainable message.  We've had the same for several other call attempts - messages and calls aren't going through.  BBC Arabic reporter Mehdi Musawi tried to reach journalists and health officials in Gaza all day and could only get short replies on WhatsApp. Eventually, they got through to Gaza's Al Shifa hospital, but by evening all lines of communication were down.By then, live footage showed complete darkness across the region. The reporter sent messages to everyone he had spoken to earlier in the day - but they did not deliver.The panic and anxiety is spreading within the Palestinian diaspora.For the past 20 days, sporadic, limited exchanges on WhatsApp have brought occasional moments of respite.However, any extended gap in communication has been met with paralysing anxiety - marked by questions like: "Are they dead, are they alive, was their house bombed too?"In one WhatsApp group relatives from around the world have been frantically messaging since the blackout. "Oh my god!!" one wrote."It seems a ground offensive may start," wrote another.The near-total telecommunications blackout in Gaza risks providing cover for "mass atrocities", Human Rights Watch said."This information blackout risks providing cover for mass atrocities and contributing to impunity for human rights violations," the group's senior technology and human rights researcher, Deborah Brown, said in a statement.The Palestinian telecoms provider Jawwal says there is a "complete interruption of all communication and internet services with the Gaza strip in light of the ongoing aggression," which it says has cut the "last of the international routes" connecting Gaza to the outside world.We've asked the Israeli military to comment on the communications outage but so far they have not responded.Additional reporting by Brandon Drenon.

27/10/2023 23:50:00	Israel angrily dismisses UN truce resolution on Gaza - BBC News	Israel has angrily dismissed a UN resolution urging a "humanitarian truce" in Gaza, vowing that it will continue to defend itself.The UN General Assembly overwhelmingly called for an immediate humanitarian truce between Israel and Hamas.Israeli UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan said the UN no longer held "even one ounce of legitimacy or relevance".The US voted against the resolution but has called for a "humanitarian pause" in Israeli military operations in Gaza.Israel's military on Friday said it was expanding its operations, as its strikes intensified across the Gaza region. Spokesman Daniel Hagari said forces had "increased the attacks in Gaza. The air force widely attacks underground targets and terrorist infrastructure, very significantly".He again told Gaza residents to move further south.Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas.The UN General Assembly on Friday voted in favour of an immediate truce in Gaza. There were 120 votes in favour, 14 against and 45 abstentions.The resolution - put forward by Jordan on behalf of the Arab group - also condemns all acts of violence against Palestinian and Israeli civilians, including all "terror and indiscriminate attacks". The vote is not legally binding, but carries moral weight due to the universality of the UN's membership.Israel's Ambassador Erdan called it "a dark day for the UN and for mankind," vowing his country would use "every means" in fighting Hamas."Today is a day that will go down as infamy. We have all witnessed that the UN no longer holds even one ounce of legitimacy or relevance," he said.He accused those who voted yes of preferring to support "the defence of Nazi terrorists" instead of Israel.US national security spokesperson John Kirby said the US would support breaks in fighting to help hostages get out of Gaza - and to allow more aid in."We would support humanitarian pauses for stuff getting in, as well as for people getting out, and that includes pushing for fuel to get in and for the restoration of electrical power," he said.The White House has not commented on the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) announcement that Israel is expanding its ground operations into Gaza.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 7,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began. There is now a critical shortage of essential services, thousands have fled their homes and the infrastructure has been heavily damaged.Among international leaders calling for a ceasefire was France's President Emmanuel Macron. Speaking before Israel said it was increasing its attacks in Gaza, he said he had told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog that the population of Gaza must be protected."A humanitarian truce is useful today to be able to protect those who are on the ground, who have suffered bombings," he said at the end of a two-day summit of EU leaders in Brussels.Mr Macron reiterated that Israel had a right to defend itself, but he said "the complete blockade, the indiscriminate bombardment and even more the prospect of a massive ground operation" posed significant risks for the civilian population in Gaza.Meanwhile, Jordan warned the outcome of what it called a "ground war" would be a humanitarian catastrophe. Israel this week called for the UN's secretary general to step down over comments he made about the Gaza war.António Guterres said in a speech to the Security Council on Tuesday that he condemned unequivocally Hamas's deadly attacks in Israel two weeks ago but that they "did not happen in a vacuum".Israel accused him of "justifying terrorism" and called for his immediate resignation.	
27/10/2023 18:17:00	Gaza before and after: Satellite images show destruction - BBC News	New satellite images of Gaza show the extent of the destruction caused by Israel's intense aerial bombardment of the territory - home to 2.2 million people - over the past three weeks. The pictures, released by Maxar Technologies, compare detailed images captured from space earlier this week with images from before the recent conflict began. They show three areas in the north of Gaza where aerial attacks have left dozens of tower blocks completely destroyed or badly damaged as well as large areas of tightly packed buildings reduced to piles of grey rubble. Beit Hanoun, a settlement in the north-eastern corner of Gaza that is just 2km (1.2 miles) away from the border with Israel, is one area shown to have been badly affected. The Israeli military have said the area is a hub for Hamas and it was one of the first areas where Israel warned residents to leave.The area of Beit Hanoun shown below sits on the main road to the Erez border crossing. Several multi-storey buildings that were visible just over two weeks ago are now barely standing. The Hamas-run housing ministry has estimated that about 45% of all the housing units in the territory have been either completely destroyed, rendered uninhabitable or damaged. An estimated 1.4 million people are internally displaced.Thousands of Palestinians have fled their homes in the north of Gaza after being told by the Israeli military to leave for their own safety - but some have returned to the north because strikes are also being carried out in the south. Al Karama, shown below, sits on Gaza's northern coast on the Mediterranean sea. Areas just behind the main coastal road, where several hotels are located, have been hit by Israeli strikes. In Atatra, which is about 3km (1.8 miles) south of the Israeli border, more than 20 high-rise blocks and several buildings have been badly damaged. A sports facility just south of the tower blocks, seen in the image below, was covered by grey ash from the attacks. 	
27/10/2023 14:38:00	Sharone Lifschitz's mother was freed but her father is still held by Hamas - BBC News	For the past week, Sharone Lifschitz has barely left her mother's side. Yocheved, 85, was one of two women freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza on Monday, after being taken from her home in Nir Oz."My mum is strong and resilient, but her heart is still with the people still in those cellars," says Sharone, referring to the underground tunnels where many hostages from the 7 October Hamas attack are believed to be kept.Sharone, a UK-Israeli citizen, flew to Israel when the news came through that her mother had been released. But it was a bittersweet moment. Her 83-year-old father Oded, Yocheved's husband of 63 years, is still missing, presumed to be held captive in the Gaza Strip."My father spent his life in the peace movement and he fought for the possibility of both nations [Israelis and Palestinians] living peacefully side by side," Sharone told the BBC after her mother was released."He believed that you do peace with your enemies. I hope that he is okay. I hope that he's able use his Arabic and that he is being medically treated."The Lifschitz family had lived in Nir Oz for decades and knew virtually every one of the other 400 or so residents of the liberally minded, agricultural and industrial community.More than 100 of them are thought to have been killed or captured by Hamas gunmen as they ran rampage through the kibbutz on the morning of 7 October.Sharone is now spending her days helping her mother's slow recovery, but also lobbying the Israeli government and its international allies, to do more to free the 229 Israeli and foreign hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza.She believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to invade Gaza with tanks and thousands of troops to "crush Hamas" should wait to give more time for negotiations to release the hostages. "These people [in the kibbutz] were failed. These people had to fend for themselves for nine hours," says Sharone, clearly still perplexed and aghast at how long it took the Israeli government and army to respond to the attack."We were slaughtered and nobody came for hours. This should be the absolute minimum aim, to bring these people back to their communities and their families."Sharone says her mother's naturally positive demeanour is one reason she made a gesture of peace towards one of her captors, shaking his hand and expressing "shalom", a salutation indicating peace, during the moment she was handed over to staff from the International Committee for the Red Cross.The handshake has been questioned by some in Israel, but her daughter says "she did what she felt was right at that moment".Sharone said the man was a paramedic who had tended to Yocheved during her captivity, and engaged with her in discussions of peace for the region. But Sharone was keen to stress the care Yocheved had received after the violent abduction should not detract from the hostages' ordeal.Until Yocheved's release this week, there had been no news of the Nir Oz residents taken on the back of motorbikes and cars into Gaza.Among the kidnapped is eight-year-old Ohad Munder-Zichri, his mother and two grandparents.Ohad's older cousin Osnat, 54, described the boy as "very, very smart" and "a gifted child". "He's very good at everything he does, since he was born," she says. Osnat and her children left Tel Aviv for Jerusalem, where they are staying with family, to escape the rocket barrages from Gaza.The attack on Nir Oz, founded by her parents in the mid-50s, came as a great shock."Imagine yourself, you're sitting in your home," Osnat told me. "You've done nothing to no-one and people, the worse kind of people, break into your house, take you out of your house and kidnap you."One cousin was killed in the attack, she says. This week was Ohad's ninth birthday, but his family says they can't celebrate until he and the rest of his family are free.In the days after her release, Yocheved was able to describe not only the conditions in which she'd been held captive but also that she'd been with other members of Nir Oz - but neither Ohad nor Sharone's father, Oden, were among them.Despite her mother's release, Sharone says it's too early to look to the future. Her parents' home in Nir Oz has been burned to the ground and everything from her mum's photography career and her dad's days in journalism has been lost.She says she won't return to her own family in the UK, nor will her mother Yocheved rest until Oded and the other members of Kibbutz Nir Oz, including Ohad, are free.	
27/10/2023 13:47:00	US strikes Syria bases used by Iran-linked groups - BBC News	The US has carried out air strikes against two weapons and ammunition storage facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran's Revolutionary Guards.Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said the strikes were in response to recent attacks on US bases in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups.The US strikes were "separate and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas," he said in a statement.Iran did not immediately comment.The strikes, carried out by a pair of F-16 US air force fighters, took place on Friday at around 04:30 local time (01:30 GMT) near Abu Kamal, a town on the border with Iraq. It is not yet known if there were any casualties from the attacks."These precision self-defence strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against US personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on October 17," Mr Austin said in a statement.US and coalition troops have been attacked at least 12 times in Iraq and four times in Syria since the conflict between Israel and Hamas began.A total of 21 US military personnel have suffered minor injuries, according to the Pentagon.American officials attribute the attacks to Iranian proxy groups operating in the region. Iran backs both Hamas, which controls Gaza, and Hezbollah, which operates in Lebanon, with arms as well as money."These Iranian-backed attacks against US forces are unacceptable and must stop," Mr Austin said."If attacks by Iran's proxies against US forces continue, we will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to protect our people."In normal times, these air strikes would not be that remarkable.But with a war raging in the Gaza Strip and fears of an escalation into a regional conflict there is an underlying worry that Iran and its proxies could soon get involved in the fight between Israel and Hamas, sparking a wider and even more serious war.The White House said on Thursday that President Joe Biden had warned Iran against targeting US personnel in the Middle East via a rare message to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. At a UN General Assembly meeting in New York also on Thursday, Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned that Washington would not be spared from the fire engulfing the region if the violence in Gaza continued.The US has sent warships and fighter aircraft to the region in recent weeks. On Thursday, US officials said some 900 US troops were also being moved there.The US is at great pains to emphasise that the overnight action in eastern Syria is not connected to what is going on in Gaza, that it was not done in any coordination with Israel, and that it is a completely separate action of self-defence.It is trying to distance its action and tell Iran to back off. Despite this, it will be seen as connected and part of US actions in the region that are seen as supportive of Israel. The US is already perceived in much of the Arab world as a close ally of Israel, so US bases are on quite a high alert.One of the reasons why the US has asked Israel to pause any ground incursion into Gaza is because it needs a bit more time to get its air defences into bases, in anticipation of any Iranian-backed militia attacks.US bases have come under attack before, with the US responding with retaliatory strikes. In March, the US carried out multiple air strikes in eastern Syria against Iran-linked groups after a drone attack killed a US contractor.	
27/10/2023 09:11:00	Qatar sentences Indian ex-naval officers to death - BBC News	India has said it is exploring all legal options after a court in Qatar sentenced eight former Indian naval officers to death on unspecified charges.Reports say the men, who worked with a private company in Qatar, were arrested last year on suspicion of spying. Neither Qatar nor India have revealed the specific charges against them. On Thursday, the Indian government said it was "deeply shocked" and would take up the verdict with Qatari authorities.India's foreign ministry said in a statement that it was awaiting the detailed judgment and attached "high importance to this case". "We are in touch with the family members and the legal team, and we are exploring all legal options," the ministry said, adding that it would not make further comment right now because of the "confidential nature of proceedings of this case".The statement describes the men as employees of a private company called Al Dahra, but they have been widely reported to be former personnel of the Indian Navy. Last year, in parliament, foreign minister S Jaishankar described them as "ex-servicemen" of the country. The families of some of the men have also confirmed their identities and background in the Navy to local media.Their arrest in August last year had made front-page headlines in India, but there has been little confirmed information about the charges against them. According to The Hindu newspaper, the men were allegedly accused of "breaching sensitive secrets" but neither of the governments have confirmed this. The BBC could not independently verify the allegations but has reached out to the Qatar embassy with questions. Experts say the recent diplomatic tensions could impact relations between the two countries. "There are over 700,000 Indians in Qatar and we have close economic ties. The Indian government has been following the case closely without doubt, but would need to take it up at the highest level to ensure their lives are saved," Former Indian ambassador to Qatar, Deepa Gopalan, told The Hindu. In December, Mr Jaishankar told parliament that the government was in constant touch with Qatar over the "very sensitive case"."Their interests are foremost in our minds. Ambassadors and senior officials are in constant touch with Qatar's govt. We assure, they're our priority," he said.Millions of Indians live in the Gulf, with tens of thousands of them working in semi-skilled and unskilled low-income jobs.These migrant workers have played a key role in building the economies of Gulf Arab states and also form an important source of remittances for India.

26/10/2023 22:45:00	Israel Gaza: EU calls for 'corridors and pauses' for humanitarian aid - BBC News	EU leaders have called for "corridors and pauses" as a means to get badly needed humanitarian aid into Gaza.After more than five hours of talks at a summit in Brussels, a joint statement urged safe and unhindered access.It follows days of disagreement, with some member states arguing for a longer, single pause in the fighting.Israel began bombing Gaza and cut off fuel, food and other supplies after Hamas's attack in which 1,400 people were killed and 224 taken hostage.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 7,000 people have been killed in the territory since then and that its health system is facing total collapse, with a third of hospitals not functioning and the rest only treating emergency cases.Only small amounts of aid have started reaching Gaza in recent days.The EU leaders' summit is their first face-to-face meeting since the 7 October attacks.Their statement condemns the Hamas attacks and "strongly emphasises Israel's right to defend itself in line with international law"."The European Council expresses its gravest concern for the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and calls for continued, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid to reach those in need through all necessary measures including humanitarian corridors and pauses for humanitarian needs," the statement reads.This may not seem like much, but for an institution that represents 27 countries with some fundamentally opposing views on the Israel-Palestinian conflict - it's a compromise. "Humanitarian pauses" are meant as short intervals of just a few hours, so that the EU can "work closely with partners in the region to protect civilians, provide assistance and facilitate access to food, water, medical care, fuel and shelter, ensuring that such assistance is not abused by terrorist organisations", the statement reads.This follows days of complex negotiations about whether to call for a "pause" (singular) or "pauses" (plural). "A single, humanitarian pause would be too close to the concept of a ceasefire - when Israel has the right to defend itself from attack," an EU diplomat told the BBC. "A pause means both actors stop for good, whereas pauses is temporary."This position was shared by those European countries that have taken a strong pro-Israel stance - including Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic and most importantly Germany, which undoubtedly had a big say in the wording of the EU statement. Some countries will be disappointed. Both Ireland's and Spain's leaders, speaking to journalists before the start of the negotiations, had called for a ceasefire. But the Spanish caretaker Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez will be pleased about a new line added to the EU statement at the last minute: "The European Union supports the holding of an international peace conference soon."He had called earlier today for an international peace summit in six months to find a solution to the long-standing conflict in the region. The EU is not a military power - all they can do, really, is exercise diplomatic pressure and grant aid. And ultimately, this statement might not change anything. Earlier today Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, said the country would make its own decisions about its war plans in Gaza, based on its own interests.  	
26/10/2023 20:46:00	Rochdale family-of-10 trapped at Gaza border crossing - BBC News	A family of 10 from Greater Manchester who are stuck in Gaza are pleading with the British Government to help them escape. The Al-Attar family from Rochdale arrived two days before Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, prompting a bombardment of Gaza.The family have fled to the border crossing with Egypt and have been posting videos online.The Foreign Office has been contacted for a comment.Zaynab Al-Wandawi, her sister-in-law Ikram, plus her husband, his mother and his seven brothers are at the Rafah crossing near Egypt."Every single day we are bombarded with bombs, and each one we hear we think 'who did that kill?'," said Zaynab."We have contacted the British embassy to see if they get their own citizens out but with no success."No more bombs please get us home."The Al-Attar family thought they were safe in Khan Younis in the south of Gaza, where the Israelis told people in the north to flee to for safety. But they are now at the Rafah crossing, trying to get into Egypt, with thousands of others.The prime minister and foreign secretary are said to have been pushing for the release and safe passage of British subject trapped or being held hostage in Gaza. The family's MP Tony Lloyd said: "I would like the Foreign Office to give them every help to get home."The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has yet to respond to a request for a comment.However, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spelled out the government's position on Wednesday, saying: "We do want British nationals to leave leave Gaza and we want hostages to be released, but there have to be specific pauses for this to happen."Ikram Al-Attar, a student at the University of Manchester, pleaded: "Please help call for a ceasefire - no more bombs, no more children need to die."Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

26/10/2023 18:49:00	UN agencies reduce Gaza aid operations as fuel runs out - BBC News	UN aid agencies say they have begun to significantly reduce their operations in the Gaza Strip because they have almost exhausted their fuel reserves.Small quantities of fuel retrieved from existing reserves are being used to maintain the water supply in the south, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering from Israeli strikes.However, they will run out on Thursday.The agencies say they have reduced their support for overwhelmed hospitals and bakeries feeding the displaced."What we are seeing in the Gaza Strip is unprecedented," Juliette Touma of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, told the BBC. "Two million people are being strangled. Gaza is being choked with very, very little assistance that is coming from outside."Israel began its bombing campaign in Gaza, cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for a cross-border attack by Hamas on 7 October, in which at least 1,400 people were killed and 224 taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 7,000 people have been killed in the territory since then and that its health system is facing total collapse, with a third of hospitals not functioning and the rest only treating emergency cases.At least 74 lorries carrying food, water and medical supplies have crossed from Egypt via the Rafah border crossing since Saturday, which Ms Touma called "a drop in the ocean of overwhelming needs". About 500 lorries were allowed into Gaza every day before the start of the war.Israel refuses to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas, which it classes as a terrorist organisation - as do the UK, US and other powers. But Ms Touma said Unrwa urgently needed fuel if it was to continue to serve as a lifeline for the 629,000 displaced people taking refuge inside its facilities. Most fled homes in the north of Gaza after being told by the Israeli military to leave for their own safety."We're the largest humanitarian organisation and we are on the verge of stopping operations. We are being banned from undertaking the mandate that was entrusted to us by the UN General Assembly. All we're asking to do is to be able to do our work," she added.Dr Abdelkader Hammad, a surgeon at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital in the UK who arrived in Gaza to carry out transplants the day before the war began, is sheltering at a UN facility in the southern city of Rafah."The situation on the ground is deteriorating day by day," he told the BBC."People are fighting for the water, for the food, because of the shortages. Whatever they have in the stores is running out now. People are queuing for hours and hours to get some bread from the bakeries which are still working." He also expressed alarm about the conditions at the hospitals where he usually performs operations, saying that his colleagues working at them were describing a "medical disaster"."Theatres are full of wounded people. They have to make very difficult decisions about who they treat because they cannot cope with the sheer number of [wounded] people coming," he said. "They are running out of medical equipment. The fuel is running out." Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said in a video briefing on X, formerly known as Twitter, that "we don't want hospitals, or the whole of Gaza, to run out of fuel". But he advised Unrwa to ask Hamas to hand over some of the hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that the military claims is being stored in a dozen tanks near the border with Egypt."There is enough for many days for hospitals and water pumps to run," he added. "Only the priorities are different. Hamas prefers to have all of the fuel for its war-fighting capabilities, leaving civilians without it."Asked to comment on the allegation, the UN's regional humanitarian chief, Lynn Hastings, told the BBC: "We don't have any information about other fuel being available for Hamas to access." "I know that is a concern of the Israelis, and quite rightly. It is something that we are trying to address with the Israelis to be able to bring in enough fuel for the humanitarian operations."Ms Hastings warned that without fuel for their back-up generators Gaza's hospitals would no longer be able to care for about 1,000 patients receiving kidney dialysis treatment, 130 premature babies in incubators, and intensive care patients on ventilators.Gaza's water desalinisation and pumping stations would also cease to function, she said."There is very, very little clean drinking water available now, which means people are resorting to drinking dirty or salinated water, or both.""It also means that the sanitation system is blocked up, because there is no electricity to pump sewage into the sea. We are expecting the streets to have sewage overflow onto them imminently."Ms Hastings also complained in a separate statement that the Israeli military was continuing to warn people in Gaza City to evacuate when they had nowhere to go or were unable to move."When the evacuation routes are bombed, when people north as well as south are caught up in hostilities, when the essentials for survival are lacking, and when there are no assurances for return, people are left with nothing but impossible choices," she warned.In a statement, the Israeli military accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, and stopping them from evacuating south. "As we have seen in the past, they use a variety of methods including roadblocks," it said. 	
26/10/2023 17:56:00	How Qatar is at the centre of Israeli hostage talks - BBC News	The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands.Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviser added his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue.To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle.So how do these hostage negotiations work?Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures.Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone.There are a lot of factors at work here.Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions.Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. "It's bad optics for them," says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge.Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Then there are the mechanics of the actual releases.As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha.Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year.Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha.In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf.All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza.But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.	
26/10/2023 15:34:00	Israel Gaza: EU leaders set to discuss humanitarian pauses - BBC News	EU leaders are meeting in Brussels at a summit overshadowed by Hamas's war with Israel and the EU's failure to project a united front.For weeks, the European Union's stance on the war has been clouded with mixed messages, diplomatic gaffes and conflicting national views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But after days of disagreement, EU leaders aim to reach a common position.At issue is whether to back a ceasefire or humanitarian pauses in the fighting.European Council President Charles Michel says the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza is of grave concern and the leaders are keen to facilitate access to food, water, medical care, fuel and shelter.They hope that will create safer conditions for the release of more than 200 hostages seized by Hamas gunmen during their 7 October attack. Many of those held captive are European dual nationals, including citizens from Germany, France, Portugal and the Netherlands.EU member states hold sharply differing views and it all makes for a very confusing picture.Arriving for the summit, Spain's caretaker Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said he would like to see a ceasefire: "But if we don't have that condition, at least a humanitarian pause in order to channel all the humanitarian aid that the Palestinian population needs urgently."Some have reservations about calling for a pause in the fighting and argue it could be seen as limiting Israel's right to self-defence.Germany and other countries do not support the idea of one, singular humanitarian pause, because that would be too close to the concept of a ceasefire, when Israel has the right to defend itself from attack.What was needed instead were shorter breaks in the fighting, one diplomat told the BBC. "A pause means both actors stop for good, whereas pauses is temporary. It's short intervals for a few hours, to get aid," they said.Germany, Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic have taken strong stances of supporting Israel. Spain and Ireland are more attuned with the Palestinian cause. Several European leaders have been on a diplomatic tour of the Middle East. Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron have all had talks with Egypt's President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer and Czech prime minister Petr Fiala visited Israel on Wednesday. Those differing views extend to the EU's executive too.The EU is the largest donor to the Palestinians, so when Oliver Varhelyi, Hungary's European Commissioner responsible for policy towards neighbouring countries, announced after the Hamas attack that all payments were being suspended and all new budget proposals postponed, it immediately set alarm bells ringing at aid agencies.The European Commission then rushed out a statement saying €691m (£600m) of aid would not be stopped, but put under review. It later said it would triple aid for Palestinians. And when European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen flew to Israel with the president of the European Parliament, she drew criticism for backing Israel's right to defend itself without stressing that it should stick to international humanitarian law. There seemed to be no effort to connect with the Palestinian Authority. However, an EU diplomat told journalists that not everything Ms von der Leyen said in Israel was posted on social media. "If you want to be effective, you don't do megaphone diplomacy," the diplomat said. "The Israeli government listens to us if we raise something behind closed doors."In a highly unusual move, more than 800 EU staff and diplomats signed an open letter criticising her "uncontrolled" support of Israel. They complained of the Commission's "double standards", pointing out that Russia's blockade of Ukraine was seen as an act of terror, while Israel's blockade of Gaza was "completely ignored"."The EU's response has been rather unfortunate and very confusing," James Moran from the Centre for European Policy Studies told the BBC."In the past, the EU approach to conflicts in the Middle East had generally managed to come out with an even-handed position. For example, in 2014 calls for a ceasefire were pretty quickly made."The EU doesn't have an army, ships or planes - but it has played an important diplomatic role in the Middle East.When it was made up of just nine members in 1980, it issued the ground-breaking Venice Declaration recognising the Palestinian people's right to self-determination.Fast forward to 2023 and the EU represents 27 countries with "fundamentally opposing views on the Middle East", an EU diplomat told the BBC. That became clear during an EU foreign ministers' meeting earlier this week, where German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock reportedly argued against a humanitarian ceasefire because Hamas was still firing rockets at Israel. As a result, the EU has so far failed to agree on what kind of pause there should be.Another crucial element is that the EU doesn't want to deviate from the US line. The German position on backing short humanitarian pauses to allow aid in is similar to that advocated by the Americans."There's a great need to maintain transatlantic solidarity on Ukraine," says James Moran. "EU-US co-operation has been very important in helping Ukrainians defend themselves from Russia's invasion."But EU diplomats point out that the war in Ukraine is not remotely comparable to what is happening in the Middle East. "It was a war on our doorstep and there was a clear enemy," a spokesperson for the European Parliament told the BBC. "Nobody ever questioned whether it was right for the EU to help Ukraine arm itself. It was an epochal change." Since the beginning of Russia's aggression, EU support has reached €82.6bn. That level of unity is missing in the Hamas-Israel war: "A lack of a single voice is the EU's Achilles heel," the EU diplomat says.Those differences are likely to resurface during the 27 EU leaders' meeting behind closed doors in Brussels.The EU was created as a peace project after the devastation caused by World War Two and does have the potential to be a peace broker.But in reality, no European country is powerful enough to stand alone as a major player - and together, they are too divided."After a long period of lack of engagement with the Middle East, we can't somehow magically wake up and turn around the conflict there," a diplomat told the BBC. 	
26/10/2023 14:52:00	Two Tanzanians and one South African among Hamas hostages, says Israel - BBC News	Two Tanzanians and a South African are among the 224 hostages being held by Hamas after the 7 October attacks in Israel, the Israeli government says.None of the three have been named.Tanzania's ambassador to Israel has confirmed that two of its citizens have been taken hostage. The BBC has spoken to the father of one Tanzanian who has been reported missing in Israel - Joshua Mollel, who was an agriculture student on a kibbutz that was targeted.He told the BBC on Thursday he still had not had any update on the fate of his son.Earlier in the week, he said they had not spoken since 5 October - two days before the attack - and that the whole family were sick with worry."We can't eat or sleep - when I go to the market people ask me why I'm losing so much weight," he said on Sunday.The South African authorities have not commented on the report that one of its citizens is among the hostages.Foreigners from 25 countries in all are being held by Hamas, Israel says.They make up 135 of the 224 being held - the largest number, 54, are from Thailand.They were taken when militants from Hamas - which Israel, the UK, US and other powers class as a terrorist organisation - crossed into Israel from Gaza killing at least 1,400 people.Israel has since retaliated with air strikes on Gaza, which the Hamas-run health ministry says have killed almost 6,500 people.	
26/10/2023 14:21:00	French Tonnerre: Why Macron is sending the ship to Gaza - BBC News	One visible result of President Emmanuel Macron's visit to Israel and its neighbours is the dispatch of a French navy vessel to the eastern Mediterranean.The Tonnerre has been widely but erroneously described as a "hospital-ship". Its main role in the conflict zone will be humanitarian, helping to deliver medical relief to the people of Gaza. But the Mistral class amphibious helicopter-carrier is one of the most important vessels in the French navy.The Tonnerre is capable of landing hundreds of troops with tanks and armoured vehicles on a foreign shore, though this mission will be quite different.The ship left its home port of Toulon on Wednesday. It is the same ship that France contracted to supply to Russia 10 years ago, but then reneged on the deal fearing - with some foresight - its offensive capacity against an enemy like Ukraine.In addition to its force projection capability, the Tonnerre has a small hospital unit, comprising 69 beds and two operating rooms - the equivalent of a hospital in a French town of 25,000.Clearly - given the scale of Gazan needs - the impact will be little more than symbolic.But the humanitarian gesture is an important one. For President Macron - who since 7 October has come under some criticism in France for tilting policy too far in favour of Israel - it permits a small rebalancing towards Arab concerns.Other more operational considerations may also apply. The Tonnerre is equipped with sophisticated communications equipment, which could help give France its own intelligence source in the conflict.And if the situation in the Middle East degenerates into a wider war, it could be important to have ships on hand to evacuate French nationals - notably in Lebanon where there are many. The Tonnerre has limited armed power, so in a conflict zone needs an escort - in this case two frigates, the Surcouf and the Alsace. 	
26/10/2023 13:59:00	Wael Al-Dahdouh: Al Jazeera reporter's family killed in Gaza strike - BBC News	The family of an Al Jazeera news reporter has been killed in an Israeli air strike on Gaza, the network has confirmed.Wael Al-Dahdouh's wife, teenage son and young daughter were all killed at a refugee camp in central Gaza on Wednesday, Al Jazeera said in a statement.It later reported that his grandson had died as well.Al Jazeera condemned the killings and Israel's "indiscriminate attack".According to the news organisation, Al-Dahdouh's family was living in a house at the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza after being displaced from northern Gaza following Israel's warning to residents to move south due to ongoing military action. Fifteen-year-old Mahmoud was in his final year at high school, Al Jazeera said, while his daughter, Sham, was seven years old and his grandson, Adam, was 18-months-old. Other family members were said to be buried under the rubble but some are known to have survived.The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that it had carried out an attack targeting Hamas in the area where members of Al-Dahdouh's family were killed. When questioned by the BBC about the loss of civilian life in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, including that of journalists and their families, IDF spokesperson Lt Col Peter Lerner said "any loss of life is a tragedy". Footage posted online showed Al-Dahdouh in tears in hospital, holding what appeared to be the body of his seven-year-old daughter and kneeling over the body of his teenage son. "There is no safe place in Gaza at all," he said in an English translation of an interview with Al Jazeera. Al-Dahdouh is Al Jazeera Arabic's bureau chief in Gaza and has worked for the news agency for several years. Al Jazeera said it was "deeply concerned about the safety, and well-being of our colleagues in Gaza and hold the Israeli authorities responsible for their security"."We urge the international community to intervene and put an end to these attacks on civilians, thereby safeguarding innocent lives."At least 24 journalists have been killed so far in the latest conflict between Israel and Gaza, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Gaza has been under continuous military bombardment by Israel following a surprise attack by Hamas fighters on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people. More than 200 people are still being held hostage.Meanwhile, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 7,000 people have been killed there. Israel has cut off supplies of fuel, electricity and most water to the territory. A small amount of aid is now getting in through Egypt. 	
26/10/2023 13:43:00	'Reconnaissance by fire' - What Israel's Gaza raid tells us - BBC News	The overnight raid into the Gaza Strip by Israeli tanks, infantry and armoured engineering units was not the first since the 7 October Hamas attack on southern Israel, but it was certainly the largest. It had several stated purposes. "Through the raid, we eliminated terrorists, we neutralised threats, dismantled explosives, neutralised ambushes," said Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari. This has been described as "a tactical operation", meaning it was limited in scope, lasting only a few hours, with all Israeli forces returning unharmed back into Israel, according to their spokesman.The Israeli government has repeatedly said it intends to launch a full-scale military incursion into Gaza to permanently destroy Hamas's military capability. Many analysts have questioned whether this is achievable, given Hamas's historic ability to replace both its lost commanders and weaponry. The overnight raid will have provided Israeli planners with some intelligence, but the longer Israel waits to launch its incursion the more time Hamas has to prepare for it, including rebuilding some of the very defences Israel says it destroyed overnight.In what, in military jargon, is known as a "shaping operation", the footage released by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) shows an armoured column breaking through the border wall and advancing across open sandy ground on the northern outskirts of Gaza. The grainy black and white footage, taken from thermal imaging cameras mounted on both aerial drones and vehicles, then shows tank fire engaging unidentified targets in the middle distance. There is no footage showing any tanks manoeuvring in the closely packed residential areas of Gaza City.The tanks involved are Merkava Mark IV's - said to be amongst the most advanced in the world - although this did not prevent Hamas fighters from disabling and capturing one of them on 7 October."Uniquely", says the former British Army tank commander Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, "the Israeli Merkava tanks can carry four Special Forces soldiers in the back, so this raid was to take out key locations, anti-tank positions and is what we call 'reconnaissance by fire'". He adds that because of Israel's superior night equipment he would expect them to operate more effectively than Hamas in the dark.Another vehicle that features in the footage released by the IDF is the D9 armoured bulldozer. Ironically, it was an ordinary civilian bulldozer that was shown in Hamas footage breaking down the Gaza border wall ahead of their raid into southern Israel on 7 October. But the vehicles used by the IDF have a specialised military purpose: to clear away obstacles, rubble and booby traps ahead of advancing troops. Operated by the IDF's Combat Engineering Corps, they have the Hebrew nickname "Doobi", meaning "teddy bear", and have been used in previous urban operations. The engine, hydraulics and cabin all have armoured protection and the bulldozers can be fitted with machine guns, grenade launchers and what is known as an "Active Protection System" to fend off explosive drones.If and when a full-scale Israeli incursion into Gaza begins then these armoured bulldozers will likely play a key role. But they are not indestructible, and one of the many threats the Israeli troops are expected to face will come from lethal off-route mines called Explosive Formed Projectiles (EFP), which can fire a bolt of molten metal at supersonic speed into the side of a tank or other armoured vehicle. Israel's Merkava tanks will likewise be vulnerable to mines buried in the road, and their turrets vulnerable to rocket-propelled grenade fire from rooftops. Much of the fighting, if it occurs, will be below ground in the many hundreds of kilometres of subterranean tunnels Hamas has built beneath the Gaza Strip. Casualties here are expected to be high and there is the added complication that this is where Hamas is believed to be holding most, if not all, of its more than 200 hostages.	
26/10/2023 13:16:00	How delay to Israel offensive benefits US - BBC News	The Israeli prime minister's ambiguous announcement of a Gaza ground invasion suits the United States - and is almost certainly influenced by it.  Benjamin Netanyahu gave no timeline for the offensive, but CBS, the BBC's US partner, has learned that it's been delayed. Washington has been coy about its role, but clear about the advantages of taking more time. US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he'd suggested that, if possible, Mr Netanyahu should wait until Hamas released more hostages, "but I did not demand it".His comment encapsulates the US approach to Israel's war with the Palestinian militant group - full support for its determination to eradicate Hamas after an unprecedented attack on Israeli civilians earlier this month, alongside concerns about the consequences of its response. The administration certainly wants to take full advantage of any window of opportunity to free Hamas captives, which will likely be closed when Israeli ground troops move into Gaza.  There are more than 200 hostages, including some Americans. The release of four in recent days has raised hopes that others could follow.  But for the Pentagon the paramount concern is rushing defensive systems into the region following attacks on American forces in Iraq and Syria by Iran-backed militias. This has increased concerns of a regional escalation once the Gaza invasion begins, and the US is using the delay to shore up protection for its interests.  The State Department has already authorised the departure of non-essential staff from embassies in Iraq and Lebanon, the latter the base of the powerful Hezbollah movement, which has been exchanging cross-border rocket fire with Israel.It's also developing contingency plans for a wider evacuation of US citizens in the region should it be deemed necessary.  In the meantime, it's been engaged in the most intensive round of diplomacy since Mr Biden took office, after Secretary of State Antony Blinken conducted a whirlwind tour of the Middle East to try and prevent a wider flare-up.  And at the United Nations, a resolution drafted by the US sums up its evolving approach to the conflict.  The humanitarian catastrophe caused by the Israeli siege on Gaza has tempered administration rhetoric about Israel's "obligation" to deal a punishing blow to Hamas.  "We solicited input," said the United States UN Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield. "We listened. We engaged with all [Security] Council members to incorporate edits, including language on humanitarian pauses and the protection of civilians fleeing conflict." Nevertheless, the resolution was vetoed by Russia and China because, they said, it didn't call for a ceasefire. America's Arab allies - Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Jordan, the UAE and the Palestinian Authority - lined up to call for a halt to the fighting, after a day-long Security Council meeting dominated by demands for a ceasefire.Many of them are no fans of Hamas, and some may want to see it defeated, but Israel's blockade and bombardment of Gaza is shaping their response. However, a ceasefire right now "only benefits Hamas", said White House spokesman, John Kirby.  And although the resolution contains robust language about the need to respect international law, the State Department has not made a formal determination on whether Israel is in fact doing so, as part of its intense bombing campaign it says is aimed at destroying Hamas infrastructure.  The air strikes have demolished whole neighbourhoods in Gaza City and killed more than 7,000 civilians, a third of them children, says the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. President Biden has cast doubt on these numbers, prompting the ministry to retort with a detailed list of people it said had been killed in the war.  Amidst Israel's relentless bombardment of Gaza it's impossible to independently verify Palestinian casualty figures. But the UN cites them, as has the State Department for previous conflicts. The department's Spokesman Matthew Miller maintained that Israel was hitting "legitimate military targets that are embedded in civilian infrastructure", adding that the US was trying to establish safe zones for civilians inside Gaza.  There hasn't been any word of progress with that. But the Americans have been able to open a trickle of aid into Gaza through its border with Egypt and are working around the clock to widen it.   Mr Biden appointed a veteran diplomat, David Satterfield, to the task. He's also trying to organise the departure of Palestinians with US citizenship, and other foreign nationals.  "You can imagine how complicated it is," says a State Department Spokesperson. "We're dealing with Israel, Egypt, and Hamas, and we're not talking directly to Hamas."   "It's like a puzzle, where you unlock a layer that can unlock one little piece of it. And then another obstacle pops up and you've got to go figure out with all the parties, how to unlock that piece." It is not clear what will happen to this nascent humanitarian corridor once the ground invasion begins. But Washington has been pressing Israel on its strategy and tactics. It has dispatched US military officers who have experienced urban combat in Iraq to ask "some of the hard questions that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] should consider as they plan various scenarios," says Pentagon Spokesperson Brig Gen Patrick Ryder, "including advice on mitigating civilian casualties." Along with very real concerns about a spiralling conflict, the US is probably attempting to reposition itself after its initial "one-sided response" in support of Israel provoked criticism, says Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard University. "It's very likely they're aware that this conflict is not playing well for the United States or for Israel in the rest of the world," he says. "In much of the Global South we're seen as deeply hypocritical, actively opposing Russian occupation in Ukraine, for all the right reasons, and doing very little about Israeli occupation [of the Palestinians] over a 50-, 60-year period." The administration has been clear that it sees the scale and brutality of this Hamas attack, killing more than 1,400 people, as different from others in the Israel-Palestinian conflict.  But its intensive engagement suggests it fears that even if Israel wins the battle against Hamas, when it comes to public opinion and regional costs, it may lose the war.

25/10/2023 23:55:00	Irish in Lebanon 'strongly advised' to leave - BBC News	The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA)  is "strongly advising" all Irish citizens to leave Lebanon while commercial options remain available.It also advises against all travel to the country due to the ongoing conflict. Tensions are high along the Lebanese border with Israel, with frequent exchanges of fire between heavily-armed militants in Lebanon and the Israeli army.The department said there would be limited assistance if the situation deteriorates further. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says almost 6,500 people have been killed since 7 October - Israel has been bombing the territory.More than 1,400 were killed in the initial attacks on Israel by Hamas, and more than 200 people are still being held hostage in Gaza.The DFA said:  "If for any reason you cannot leave Lebanon now, we would advise you to exercise extreme caution in your movements and put contingency plans in place to leave Lebanon as soon as possible."Citizens should also ensure their documentation, including passports, is up-to-date. The department stated that citizens in Lebanon should avoid any protests or demonstrations as there is a possibility of these gatherings quickly leading to violence. It advises citizens to remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities.Irish citizens in Lebanon who have not registered with the Irish Embassy in Cairo have been advised to by the department.It added: "If you are an Irish citizen and in need of emergency assistance outside of normal office hours, then you can contact us on the following emergency number: +20 1274443942."	
25/10/2023 22:55:00	George Washington University protest on Israel-Gaza war stirs outrage - BBC News	A prestigious US college has disavowed a campus protest over the Israel-Gaza war after it provoked accusations of antisemitism.Police were called on Tuesday night to stop demonstrators projecting slogans on to the side of a library at George Washington University.The college said the protest had violated its policy and caused "distress" to some students.Israel has been bombarding Gaza since a Hamas attack killed 1,400 people.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says almost 6,500 people have been killed in the territory since then.One of the messages beamed on to the building in Washington DC said, "Free Palestine from the river to the sea". Activists say the phrase is a pro-Palestinian independence rallying cry, but the Anti-Defamation League, an anti-hate watchdog, has described it as code for the destruction of the state of Israel.Other messages projected in big white letters on to the Gelman Library included "End the siege on Gaza" and "Divest from Zionist genocide now"."Glory to our martyrs" was another phrase that appeared. Demonstrators told the college newspaper, the GW Hatchet that this slogan referred to any Palestinian killed by Israel, and not Hamas gunmen.StopAntisemitism, an antisemitism watchdog, called on the university to expel the students involved."Demonstrations like this cloak themselves in politics to evade responsibility for what they really are: celebrations of murder," said its director, Liora Rez, in a statement to the BBC.The university said in a statement on Wednesday that the unauthorised protest had violated its policy."The statements made by these individuals in no way reflect the views of the university," said the college. "We are reviewing this incident and will take any appropriate steps with respect to the individuals involved in accordance with university policies."We recognize the distress, hurt, and pain this has caused for many members of our community."According to the GW Hatchet, university aides and two campus police officers asked four members of Students for Justice in Palestine to stop the protest, which lasted about two hours.Students for Justice in Palestine did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.But a spokesperson for the group told the Hachet newspaper: "I feel very frustrated with how the university has responded."They have consistently shown that they do not respect our lives. They do not respect our right to free speech."	
25/10/2023 22:48:00	Omer and Omar: How two 4-year-olds were killed and social media denied it - BBC News	In the opening days of the Israel-Gaza war two small boys, both aged four, were killed. One was Israeli, one Palestinian. But many posts I saw on social media weren't mourning their deaths - instead, they were trying to deny the killings had taken place.Omar Bilal al-Banna and Omer Siman-Tov lived roughly 23km (14.3 miles) apart, on either side of the Israel-Gaza perimeter fence. They never met, but both loved playing outside with their siblings.The faces of these little boys have appeared on my social media feed in the past week. They were both killed as violence unfolded.I've tracked down family, friends and witnesses. In both cases they tell a tragic story. Omer Siman-Tov was killed when Hamas attacked his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October.Omar Bilal al-Banna was killed four days later, following an Israeli airstrike on Zeitoun, east of Gaza City.The way the boys' deaths have been denied by social media users is symbolic of an information battle, running in parallel with the war on the ground.There have been brazen attempts to downplay or deny violence committed against children. These false allegations have shocked family and friends grieving the loss of their loved ones - and the people who witnessed what happened."The candle of my life" is how Omar Bilal al-Banna's mother Yasmeen describes her children on Instagram.Two photographers put me in touch with her, and I matched up her profiles on social media with the details available to me to confirm her identity as Omar's mother. Omar had been playing outside with his older brother Majd when he was killed. I've seen footage where Majd confirms this.In the clip he describes how the strike hit their neighbour's house, and then rubble fell on Omar. Majd was wounded too. In the footage, his leg is bandaged and he looks shocked.The first online post I saw about Omar's death was from a pro-Israeli account on X (formerly known as Twitter). It included a video, featuring a man in a grey polo shirt holding a small child's body, wrapped in a white blanket or cloth. I would later discover this child was Omar. In the accompanying caption, the person who shared the clip declared: "Hamas is desperate!" They added falsely that the group - classified as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other powers - had "released a video showing a dead Palestinian baby. But wait for the catch. It's not a real baby; it's a doll". This user said it "exposes how hard the lying and slanderous propaganda arm of Hamas and the Palestinians works". They suggested Hamas accounts had shared and then deleted the video because it wasn't real.According to X, that post containing the video and false claims has been seen 3.8 million times. The allegations it made were then amplified by the State of Israel's official account on X. It shared a new post, this time featuring that same video of the child in the white blanket - and then a still from the same video, circling the child's face. In the caption, the account wrote: "Hamas accidentally posted a video of a doll (yes a doll) suggesting that it was a part of casualties caused by an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] attack." In the hours that followed, other official accounts on X - including profiles belonging to Israel's embassies in France and Austria - repeated the claims. Before long, they were being spread by pro-Israel and anti-Hamas accounts based in Israel, as well as several that seemed to be based in India. Each time, the posts would say the child was a doll. I have watched the extended footage, and it's clear from the video that this is a real person. I tracked the original footage back to the Instagram page of a Palestinian photographer, Moamen El Halabi. He filmed the original video of the man in the grey shirt holding Omar, and I got in touch with him. I also made contact with another photojournalist, Mohammed Abed - who works for the AFP news agency - who was there at the same time. He took a photograph of the same man holding what appears to be the same child, wrapped in the white sheet. That photo has since been uploaded to the Getty Images website. The caption accompanying the photo describes the scene "outside the morgue of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City". It is dated 12 October 2023 - the same day the video clip was shared on Instagram by Moamen El Halabi. Other fact-checking organisations like Alt News have also tracked down the source of the original photos and videos. Both photojournalists provided me with further details to corroborate that the video and the photo had been taken at Al-Shifa hospital, outside the mortuary. The details included information about the situation at the hospital that day, and the man in the grey shirt, who was a relative of Omar's. They both told me, categorically, that the child pictured had not been a doll, but a real little boy - Omar Bilal al-Banna. They also shared additional images, which I have matched up with Moamen El Halabi's original video footage to verify the child's identity. Since we spoke, Mohammed Abed has posted an Instagram story with the photo he took. He declares in the caption: "This picture [is] not a doll, its [one] I took at Al-Shifa hospital and it's the very truth." It seems that part of what made people think what they saw was a doll, rather than a child, was the colour of Omar's skin in the photograph. But Mr Abed said he had photographed several children killed in strikes in Gaza and their skin looked similar.Omar's mother Yasmeen confirmed that her son had been killed by an air strike, adding that lies about the "killing of children and innocent people are untrue and fake". "They have no right to say he is a doll," she said. "They [the Israeli government] are lying and evading their crimes and massacres," she added. A spokesperson for the Israeli embassy in the UK did not comment directly on these social media posts or on the circumstances of Omar's death. They told the BBC that "it is very important to review instances of disinformation" but also accused the BBC of spreading misinformation. X did not reply to the BBC's request for comment. "Omer was just an angel. He was so, so, beautiful and cute and pure. He was very close to his sisters. They were always playing together and they were so kind to him," Mor Lacob, a friend of the Siman-Tov family, told me.She messaged them on WhatsApp on the sunny Saturday morning when Hamas gunmen broke through the Gaza perimeter fence and attacked their kibbutz. She told me they confirmed to her that they had managed to get into their shelter, but that was the last she heard. Further messages sent to her friends were left unread. Mor Lacob later found out that Omer's parents, Tamar and Yonatan, had been shot dead. Their three children - Omer plus his older sisters Shachar and Arbel - were killed when their home was set on fire. Their deaths have been covered by major news outlets. In a photo, Omer is smiling - surrounded by his parents and sisters.The image was shared by the Israeli government's account on X, the post describing them as "an entire family wiped out by Hamas terrorists. There are no words. May their memory be a blessing". It was also shared by the former Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett.But when I read the comments below - while there were many speaking of the terrible shock and offering support - there were others I had not expected to find.Several accounts that supported Hamas claimed that Omer had been a "paid actor" because Hamas "didn't kill kids". Others said this was "Jewish propaganda at its finest", declaring that neither Omer, nor his sisters, had been killed. One wrote "there's no evidence" they were dead and asked to "stop the lying". Scrolling through several other posts and videos showing the Siman-Tov family on different social media sites, I encountered dozens and dozens of similar comments. Some suggested that he and his sisters had been "crisis actors" - people paid to act out a tragedy.I checked out the profiles behind the comments. Many of them appeared to be real people based around the world. Several actively supported Hamas, and a couple appeared to be based in the occupied West Bank. These were not accounts with huge followings. However, the cumulative effect of their posts seemed to bolster wider, viral social media narratives trying to suggest that Hamas had not killed or attacked any children, in spite of the widespread evidence of such violence.Other untrue comments I spotted suggested that the murders had been real, but that Hamas gunmen had not been responsible. One user wrote, "I guess it's Israel themselves" who killed these children and the Israelis were "trying to blame Hamas". Speaking to me from her home in Sydney, Australia, Mor Lacob said the comments on social media had caused her extra distress at a time when she was grieving her friends. "I just want the world to remember and to know what happened. To deal with their death is hard enough, and all these comments make it even worse."How can I respond to that? I need to prove they died? Why did five graves need to be filled with their beautiful bodies?"She described this kind of online disinformation as "evil and cruel". When I told her how Palestinian children too, like Omar, had had their deaths denied and questioned on social media as well, she became upset again."My heart goes out to every single innocent [person] who got murdered and killed because of Hamas's actions," she said. "It's not fair." What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?Why Is There a War?In-depth analysis from Frank Gardner looking at what started the war between Israel and Hamas.

25/10/2023 22:04:00	Humanity blasted and broken: Gaza through a medic's eyes - BBC News	Warning: This article contains distressing contentThere is nothing on his face to convey what he has seen. The lifeless bodies of children pulled from the rubble. The tents filled with the dead wrapped in white shrouds. Buildings flattened by the devastating force of air strikes. Mahmoud Badawi has seen humanity blasted, burned and broken. "There are many hard situations," he says. "As an ambulance driver you get used to what is happening. Whether it's hands, heads or bodies that are cut… we are used to this."His ambulance races from one scene of carnage to another. In a narrow alley in Gaza, he stops to collect two child casualties of an air strike. A man approaches holding a bundle in his arms. It is a boy who has been badly wounded.He calls out to a friend who is helping the emergency workers load the casualties, urging him to take extra care with the boy."Nasser, his head is open."Yet Mahmoud retains his composure. It is not that he is unmoved by all he sees but that necessity demands he focus on those who can be saved. As he speaks to a BBC journalist, there is the sound of a missile exploding."We do not rest a lot with all that is happening. The situation is very bad. Now we will try to locate the bombed area to go to the injured and the dead." Asked what is the situation with medical supplies Mahmoud says starkly: "Everything is going." According to the Hamas-led health authority in Gaza, more than 6,000 Palestinians have been killed in the last two weeks. Some 40% are reported to be children. The UN has warned that nearly a third of hospitals and two thirds of primary health care centres have had to close "due to damage from hostilities or lack of fuel". The UN says its fuel stocks are running out and that "tough choices" will have to be made about what services they prioritise in the coming days.Israel refuses to allow fuel into the Gaza Strip because it says supplies might be taken by Hamas. It also says the organisation is hoarding fuel. In Gaza the days and nights blend remorselessly into each other. The war is constant and in this small strip of land -  Gaza's total land area is only 141 sq miles (365 sq km) - it is everywhere. Israel has ordered around one million residents in the northern half of Gaza to evacuate south. It says this is to enable its forces to target Hamas. But there are continuing Israeli air strikes on southern Gaza, where thousands have fled. Whether to run; where to run; where to shelter if you do run - every day and night in Gaza is filled with desperate choices.It also means that for emergency workers there is no going home to a safe place. When he is out working Mahmoud worries for his wife and six children just as they worry for him. When the bombing is heavy he tries to call every hour. But telephone communication is difficult. "Connecting with the family is very hard. We barely have service to be able to call and know if they are okay or not." Mahmoud has worked hard to raise a family with strong aspirations to serve society. He is proud of his children. There is a daughter studying to be a doctor. She is inspired by her father's work and her own experience of war in Gaza as a child. There is also a son who is a nurse. And another who has qualified as a teacher. As night comes there is a lull in the bombing. Mahmoud pauses and stands between his ambulance and a pile of rubble. He is holding a stretcher in his left hand, waiting for the next emergency. The adrenaline has subsided. He is briefly motionless and his eyes look off into the distance. They are filled with sadness for all he has seen.With additional reporting from Majdi Fathi in Gaza and Morgan Gisholt Minard, Alice Doyard, Haneen Abdeen and Tim Facey in Jerusalem	
25/10/2023 21:09:00	Conservative MPs express concern over Israel boycott bill - BBC News	Tory MPs have criticised a government bill which would ban public bodies from boycotting Israel as a "violation of freedom of speech" and "draconian".Ex-minister Kit Malthouse said it risked "playing into the antisemitism" that has increased in the UK recently.The bill imposes a ban on public bodies making their own direct or indirect boycotts, disinvestment or sanctions campaigns against other countries.Communities Secretary Michael Gove said it would help to fight antisemitism.The government says the bill would guarantee foreign policy remained a UK government matter.The Economic Activity of Public Bodies (Overseas Matters) Bill, known as the anti-BDS bill, seeks to prevent public bodies, including councils, from campaigning against, boycotting or sanctioning a particular international territory - unless that is endorsed by the UK government's own foreign policy.It aims to limit the reach of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for broad-based economic and cultural boycotts of Israel and Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.The BDS movement is widely backed by Palestinians and anti-occupation groups in the UK. Israel sees it as antisemitic - as do the United States and Germany - and has supported moves by other governments to outlaw such boycotts by public bodies. The issue is highly controversial, often sparking rows and protest among rival groups supportive of Israel or the Palestinians. The BDS says it opposes racism including Islamophobia and antisemitism. During a debate on the bill in Parliament a number of MPs including some Conservatives and a senior Labour MP strongly criticised the legislation. Former Home Office minister Mr Malthouse argued against a section of the legislation which would forbid public authorities to say they would back a boycott if it was lawful."To not even be able to express opposition to the law whilst still complying with it seems to be very un-British, extremely illiberal and unnecessarily draconian," he said. Another former Conservative minister, George Eustice, said it was a "violation of freedom of speech". The bill gives the government the power to make certain countries exempt from the boycott restrictions.However, it does not allow the exemption of Israel, the Occupied Territories or the Occupied Golan Heights, specifically naming these areas in the legislation.  Mr Malthouse told MPs: "In carving out Israel, the West Bank and the occupied Golan Heights in the legislation, the secretary of state is, I'm afraid, playing into the antisemitism that we've seen rise in this country over the last few weeks."Senior Jewish Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge also expressed a fear that the bill would strengthen polarisation at a time when the Israel-Gaza war had already heightened community tensions.She told MPs: "To bring this wrong-headed, poorly-drafted politically-motivated bill back in the midst of these horrors we are seeing every day… is an act of complete irresponsibility and unbelievable foolishness."Mr Gove robustly defended his bill, insisting it would not undermine free speech or prevent local authorities from taking into account human rights considerations when making decisions.He told MPs that the bill had the backing of the representative bodies that speak for Britain's Jewish community.He said: "When they are so clear that this legislation is in the interests of community cohesion, fighting antisemitism, and making the United Kingdom a safe house for everyone, when they are so clear, we should treat their words with respect."The bill was also backed by Conservative MP Theresa Villiers who said local authorities should be focused on "delivering services not conducting their own foreign policy".Another Tory, Andrew Percy, disagreed with MPs who said the bill should not be brought forward while tensions were running high. "Are we waiting until Hamas give us permission," he asked.Amendments from Labour, Conservative and SNP MPs were defeated and the bill continues its progress through Parliament. 	
25/10/2023 19:41:00	Gaza's hospitals treating emergency cases only as fuel runs low - BBC News	Hospitals in the Gaza Strip are taking emergency cases only, the UN says, amid fears fuel supplies will run out across the territory in the coming hours. UN facilities are also overwhelmed by 600,000 displaced Palestinians seeking shelter - four times their capacity.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza meanwhile says that more than 700 people have been killed by Israeli air strikes for a second day in a row.Israel's military says it is targeting Hamas fighters and infrastructure.It launched a bombing campaign against Hamas - which Israel, the UK, US and other powers class as a terrorist organisation - in response to an unprecedented cross-border assault on 7 October in which at least 1,400 people were killed and 222 others were taken hostage.Israel is also blocking new fuel deliveries to Gaza, saying they could be stolen and exploited by Hamas for military purposes. It accuses Hamas of stockpiling hundreds of thousands of litres of diesel and refusing to share it.The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is at the main hospital in Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis, says hospitals across the territory shut down all departments except for their emergency rooms on Wednesday. He says this is to conserve fuel needed to power life-saving equipment, such as ventilators, neonatal incubators and kidney dialysis machines."The hospitals are in a state of complete collapse," Mohammed Abu Selmeya, the head of Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa, told AFP news agency. The World Health Organization's representative, Dr Richard Peeperkorn, earlier told the BBC that hospitals supported by the UN agency were running generators "at minimum levels only for life-saving operations".Israel stopped suppling electricity to Gaza following Hamas's attacks. The territory was left dependent on back-up generators after its sole power station ran out of fuel on 11 October.Aid agencies and medics inside Gaza warn that more people will die if key equipment stalls without electricity.The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, which runs the largest humanitarian operation in Gaza, also says it will have to halt all its operations in Gaza on Wednesday night if it does not get more supplies of fuel.International calls for increased humanitarian access to Gaza have been growing louder, with the 1.4 million people who have fled their homes struggling to find food, clean water and shelter.At least 60 aid lorries have entered Gaza from Egypt since the weekend, but this provides only a fraction of the needs of people in Gaza. Aid agencies say at least 100 lorryloads of aid are needed every day.The death toll in Gaza has also risen sharply, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting that 756 people were killed over the past 24 hours.It said a total of 6,547 people, including 2,704 children, had been killed since Israel started its retaliatory air and artillery strikes.The Israeli military said on Wednesday morning that it had continued "wide-scale strikes" across Gaza, targeting Hamas infrastructure, including "terror tunnel shafts, military headquarters, weapons warehouses, mortar launchers and anti-tank missile launchers".It also said it had struck Hamas's emergency operational apparatus, which it said had set up roadblocks preventing civilians from heading south.Hundreds of thousands have fled the north of Gaza after the military told them to leave for their own safety ahead of an expected ground invasion.On Tuesday night, the military said it had targeted a cell of Hamas divers that tried to infiltrate Israel by sea.	
25/10/2023 18:29:00	Israel demands UN chief resign over Hamas attack comments - BBC News	Israel has demanded that the UN's secretary general retract comments he made about the Gaza war and apologise.António Guterres said in a speech to the Security Council on Tuesday that he condemned unequivocally Hamas's deadly attacks in Israel two weeks ago but that they "did not happen in a vacuum".Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan accused him of "justifying terrorism" and called for his immediate resignation.On Wednesday, Mr Guterres rejected "misrepresentations" of his statement.But Mr Erdan said in reply that the UN chief "once again distorts and twists reality", and repeated his call for Mr Guterres to resign.On 7 October, some 1,500 Hamas gunmen infiltrated southern Israel from Gaza. They killed at least 1,400 people, most of them civilians, and took another 222 people as hostages.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 6,500 people have been killed in the territory since Israel retaliated with air and artillery strikes while massing troops for an expected ground invasion.Addressing a meeting of the UN Security Council in New York on Tuesday, Mr Guterres urged all parties in the war to respect and protect civilians."I have condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented 7 October acts of terror by Hamas in Israel. Nothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnapping of civilians - or the launching of rockets against civilian targets."He then told the council that it was "important to also recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum", adding: "The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation."He described how Palestinians had "seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished"."But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people."Mr Guterres also said he was deeply concerned about "the clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza".He expressed alarm at Israel's continuous bombardment of Gaza, as well as the level of civilian casualties and "wholesale destruction of neighbourhoods".Without naming Hamas, he stressed that "protecting civilians can never mean using them as human shields".And without naming Israel, he said: "Protecting civilians does not mean ordering more than one million people to evacuate to the south, where there is no shelter, no food, no water, no medicine and no fuel, and then continuing to bomb the south itself."The UN chief also appealed for a humanitarian ceasefire to make the delivery of aid to Gaza easier and safer, and to facilitate the release of the hostages.He called the crossing from Egypt of 62 lorries carrying food, water and medical supplies since Saturday "a drop of aid in an ocean of need". He warned that the failure to include fuel risked a disaster, explaining that hospitals would be left without power and drinking water would not be purified or pumped.The foreign minister of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, Riyad al-Maliki, demanded an end to what he called the "ongoing massacres being deliberately and systematically and savagely perpetrated by Israel" against the two million people living in Gaza.Visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen criticised Mr Guterres in his speech to the Security Council, asking him: "In what world do you live?"Mr Cohen said the killing of 1,400 men, women and children by Hamas constituted a massacre that would "go down in history as more brutal" than those committed by the Islamic State (IS) group.  "Hamas are the new Nazis," Mr Cohen declared. "Just as the civilised world united to defeat the Nazis, just as the civilised world united to defeat [IS], the civilised world has to stand united behind Israel to defeat Hamas."Addressing the UN's appeals for proportionality and a ceasefire, he said: "Tell me, what is a proportionate response for killing of babies, for rape [of] women and burn them, for beheading a child? How can you agree to a ceasefire with someone who swore to kill and destroy your own existence?"Mr Cohen later wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: "I will not meet with the UN secretary general. After the October 7th massacre, there is no place for a balanced approach."  Mr Erdan said the secretary general had "expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder".On Wednesday, the ambassador was quoted by Israeli news website Ynet as saying he had informed the UN's Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, Martin Griffiths, that his request for an Israeli visa had been refused because of Mr Guterres's remarks."He will not be able to come here to the region. Their agencies constantly need to bring in new people, certainly at a time like now. They will be refused."A spokesman for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said "there is and can be no justification for Hamas's barbaric terrorist attack which was driven by hatred and ideology". Later, Mr Guterres told reporters: "I am shocked by the misrepresentations by some of my statement... as if, as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas. This is false. It was the opposite.""I believe it was necessary to set the record straight, especially out of respect to the victims and to their families," he added.But Mr Erdan said it was a "disgrace to the UN that the secretary general does not retract his words and is not even able to apologise for what he said yesterday". "Every person understands very well that the meaning of his words is that Israel has guilt for the actions of Hamas or, at the very least, it shows his understanding for the 'background' leading up to the massacre," he said."A secretary general who does not understand that the murder of innocents can never be understood by any 'background' cannot be secretary general... I again call on him to resign."	
25/10/2023 17:52:00	Israelis and Palestinians fear worst to come after Gaza violence - BBC News	In the last few days I have been in southern Israel close to the border with Gaza, deep in the West Bank with hard-line Jewish settlers, and seen the funeral of two young Palestinian men killed by the Israeli army in a raid on a refugee camp. I've spoken to a former Israeli leader in his office in a Tel Aviv high rise, and a senior Palestinian official in his office in a villa in Ramallah. I have heard an Israeli father at a vigil in Tel Aviv describe how his daughter's birthday cake was still in the fridge when his wife and three young children were taken by Hamas gunmen as hostages. What I have not been able to do is enter Gaza. Only small convoys of aid, and a handful of Israeli combat troops on raids and reconnaissance, have been able to do that. More Palestinians and Israelis have been killed in the last two and a half weeks or so than in the entire second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, that lasted from 2000 until it petered out around the end of 2004. Among the different people I've met, Palestinians and Israelis as well as foreigners, I have had a single clear impression. A sense that the grim old routines that have settled on this long conflict since the end of the last intifada have been swept away by the enormity of events since 7 October, and replaced with a fear that what comes next will be even worse. The occupied Palestinian territories consist of Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Israel captured them, along with the Golan Heights which it took from Syria, in the 1967 Middle East war. It was the most sweeping and rapid victory in Israel's history, achieved in only six days. Coming 19 years after Israel's independence war of 1948, which Palestinians call the catastrophe, or al-Nakba, the 1967 war created the cockpit in which the conflict as it stands today is fought. Like many others who follow the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians I have felt for the last few years that a major explosion was coming. On 14 May 2018, I thought that might have started, during the terrible violence that accompanied President Donald Trump's decision to move the embassy of the United States from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. President Trump rejected the international convention that Jerusalem's status was unresolved, as both Israel and the Palestinians claim it as a capital. He sided with Israel. Most of Israel's other allies, including the United Kingdom, still have their embassies in Tel Aviv. As the president's daughter Ivanka Trump opened the embassy, broadcasters split their screens to show terrible violence on the border wire between Israel and Gaza. Israeli soldiers shot to kill as thousands of Palestinians demonstrated near the fence in what was called "the great march of return" by Hamas. Some of them tried to pull the fence down. Some 59 Palestinians were shot dead and thousands more wounded. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, supported by the US, said any country would repel an attack on its border. The next day was much calmer.  A few weeks later the routines of the conflict were re-established. Benjamin Netanyahu, and his allies in the Trump administration, were able to congratulate themselves that the Palestinians had been contained. Perhaps that was the moment that Hamas started planning a much more devastating way to breach the border and attack Israel, which culminated in the 7 October attacks. Benjamin Netanyahu's decision - supported by the Americans - to allow the conflict to fester, in the mistaken belief that Israel could keep a lid on it while attending to more important matters, turned out to be a strategic error of monumental proportions. I walked up the stone staircase to the office of Sabri Saidam in Ramallah, the de facto Palestinian capital of the West Bank. He was educated at Imperial College, London, is an adviser to President Mahmoud Abbas and is a senior member of Fatah, the faction once led by Yasser Arafat that dominates the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Mr Abbas heads the Palestinian Authority, which was created in the Oslo peace process of the 1990s as a government in the making for an independent state. Now it is at best a job creation scheme with municipal functions, at worst a symbol of inefficiency and corruption. Abbas has not put himself up for re-election since 2006.Sabri Saidam said they had warned the Americans over Benjamin Netanyahu's belief that he could manage the Palestinians while trying, with American help, to normalise relations with the rich Gulf Arab oil monarchies.    "A reaction was coming. It was in the pipeline. Nobody knew what was the scale and the shape of it. But we have told the Americans many times in meetings that the Palestinians would react and don't leave matters hanging in the balance. You have to intervene. You have to be serious about the peace process." He rejected the suggestion that Hamas was using people as human shields and now, he said, Israel is engaged in "genocide". The peace process is shorthand for the years of ultimately failed negotiations that were supposed to end the conflict by creating an independent Palestine alongside Israel. That is the "two-state solution" that President Joe Biden, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, President Emmanuel Macron and other dignitaries who have been here in the last few weeks have said once again is the only realistic solution. The trouble with that is that there is no peace process - the Americans last tried, and failed, to revive it ten years ago under President Barack Obama - and the two-state solution has become an empty slogan. I went to see the former Prime Minister Ehud Barak in his glass-walled office in a tower in Tel Aviv. In 1973, as a young special forces commander, he planned and led an audacious raid on Lebanon, which they called Operation Spring of Youth. Barak was disguised as a woman, with make-up and a blonde wig, as he led an assassination team that slipped into Beirut to devastating effect. Mr Barak went on to command the Israeli military and was prime minister from 1999-2001 and later served as defence minister under Benjamin Netanyahu, who in turn had been a junior officer in his special forces unit, the Israeli equivalent of Britain's SAS. Since then, Ehud Barak and Benjamin Netanyahu have become political enemies. Barak has blamed Netanyahu for mistakes that left Israel vulnerable to Hamas. He believes the prime minister's long years in office will end once the army deals with Hamas.  "Winning the war," Mr Barak told me, "will take time and then the torrent of sweat and decent blood is not going to be something simple… when it's over or half over or there is a situation of whatever kind it would be a volcano of rage, it will erupt, I believe. To remove this government from power."One reason for Mr Netanyahu's reluctance, up to now anyway, to send ground troops into Gaza is the presence of more than 200 hostages, mostly Israeli civilians. Hamas took them to put pressure on Israel and is succeeding.Releasing four hostages and talking about freeing many more has become an effective tactic in the psychological war between the two sides. Voices in Israel are getting louder, demanding a halt to any invasion plans until the hostages are free.Ehud Barak, who believes Israel has to send troops into Gaza to eliminate Hamas, said that hard choices lie ahead for Prime Minister Netanyahu and his war cabinet. "If there is no other way, we will have to do it, because the alternative is to provide those barbarians and terrorists who made crimes against humanity [with] impunity due to the fact that they massacred, slaughtered probably 1,500 people…  A very painful and tough decision might have to be made." I drove through the West Bank over two days this week, and saw an area that was extremely tense, with Israel in tight control. Thousands of soldiers in combat gear have sealed off Palestinian villages, set up roadblocks and are protecting Jewish settlements, which are regarded as illegal under international law although Israel disputes this. In an isolated settler outpost on a desolate hilltop outside Hebron, hard line Jewish nationalists carrying weapons told me they were waiting for the chance to use them against Palestinians. Their leader Meir Simcha, who walked round the outpost armed with a large machete in a leather scabbard, said that unlike other Israelis they had not been surprised by the Hamas assault on 7 October. It was a shame, he said, that so many Jews had to die to show mainstream Israel something he believed was self-evident."In a war you have a gun and a trigger," Simcha said. "And for those who don't understand yet, we are at war. A war where the other side shows no mercy and we need to do the same. There's no choice." Further north in the West Bank, the atmosphere in Jalazone refugee camp, just outside Ramallah, was sombre, fearful and angry, as two young men killed in an Israeli army arrest operation were buried. Mustapha al-Ayan - cousin of Mahmoud Seif, one of the dead men who was shot as he threw stones at the Israelis - said the army had not come to arrest suspects but to punish them for what Hamas did on 7 October. The grave was being filled behind him as he told me: "They are coming to the West Bank to take revenge, because the resistance groups in Gaza have hurt them. So now they are attacking the people in the West Bank. God give mercy to all the martyrs in Gaza and the West Bank." One fear often expressed by Palestinians is that Israel, in its rage, is using the crisis to try to inflict another Nakba, or catastrophe, on the scale of 1948. The evidence they cite is the way that more than a million Gazans have been forced to flee to the south of the Strip, and the threats made by some Israeli politicians to make Gaza smaller by taking tranches of land to use as buffer zones. In Ramallah, Sabri Saidam, the Fatah official, talked about a map that Mr Netanyahu produced at the United Nations in September, showing an Israel that included the West Bank and Gaza."Everybody has in mind that the very map that Netanyahu carried before the nations at the General Assembly of the UN, in which there was no West Bank and Gaza. So the feel and general mood is actually entertaining the thought that Netanyahu is going after the deportation, the displacement of Palestinians leading up to the annexation of Gaza." The ghosts of the past shape the mood on both sides. For Israel it is the Holocaust of European Jews at the hands of Nazi Germany. The massacres on 7 October have been called the worst day for the Jews since the Holocaust. The word "selection", that was used to describe the way Jews arriving at death camps were either sent straight to the gas chambers or spared to be worked to death, has been applied to suggestions that deals might be done that release foreign hostages before Israelis. Palestinians don't share much with Israelis, especially not now, except the shadow of the past and a dread of harder times ahead.	
25/10/2023 16:31:00	Lianne, Noiya and Yahel Sharabi: Funeral held for mother and daughters killed by Hamas - BBC News	It is the saddest of sights. Opposite the pomegranate trees in a quiet corner so at odds with the manner of their death, three graves have been dug for a mother and her daughters: Lianne, Noiya and Yahel Sharabi. A family Hamas tried to obliterate. The contrast between this scene and a photo of smiling mum Lianne with her arms around her two teenage daughters, taken just a few months ago as they celebrated on Kibbutz Be'eri, in southern Israel, could not be starker. They cannot even return home in death. Be'eri has been destroyed - the scene of a massacre. Too many are dead, yet the living cannot bury their dead there.So this British-Israeli family is being buried in a cemetery about 25 miles (40km) from the Gaza border.The Sharabis cannot even rest in peace. The girls' dad Eli is still missing. Their uncle Yosi has been kidnapped. Here children can't mourn their parents. Parents can't grieve their children.In Israel, hundreds of people gathered for their funeral with many wearing T-shirts that read: "Lianne, Noiya and Yahel have been murdered. Bring back Eli and Yosi now."Teenage girls cried for their friends Yahel and Noiya, unable to comprehend what has happened to this family.Dead, missing, kidnapped. The horror of that day, for this country, in one family. Lianne came to Israel from Bristol aged just 19 to work on a kibbutz. She then built her life here until Hamas decided to take that from her and her daughters.She was a caring mother, wife, daughter and sister, with a dry sense of humour.Her 13-year-old daughter, Yahel, was a bundle of energy, full of adventure and mischief. And Noiya, 16, was a gifted student, sensitive and fun.Their lives are now encapsulated in just a few words."Our entire world is broken", their uncle said.Lianne's family and friends in Bristol have been unable to travel here but said they would watch the funeral in the UK "united in grief".They remembered Yahel for her sense of adventure, riding her bike at "breakneck speed around the kibbutz" and for dancing along to TikTok videos with her sister and, on occasions, her British cousins.Her family in the UK said they were left with "a Yahel-shaped hole in our lives that can never be filled".Noiya was described as a "beautiful and talented young woman" who was "always the big sister"."A beacon of light extinguished too soon," her family said in her eulogy.Lianne, the third of four siblings, was described as "unique, rare, special".Her brother Steve described her as "big in every way - her love, her personality, her attitude and her mouth".In a eulogy, her mother Gill said she had a dry sense of humour - "sometimes irreverent, but never malicious"."We will miss our girl to the end of our days and keep her in our hearts forever, tucked away with the fondest memories of her 48 years," she said.	
25/10/2023 14:40:00	Rishi Sunak backs calls for humanitarian pauses in Israel-Hamas war - BBC News	Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has supported "specific pauses" in the Israel-Hamas war, echoing international calls to allow more aid into Gaza.Mr Sunak told MPs a "safer environment" was needed in the territory to deliver aid and get British nationals out.But the prime minister did not back a ceasefire as that would only benefit Hamas, his spokesperson said.His comments follow appeals for a humanitarian pause by the United Nations, the US and Canada.The prime minister said the UK had discussed the idea with allies at the UN, as he announced that an RAF plane was flying to Egypt with 21 tonnes of humanitarian supplies.International calls for increased humanitarian access to Gaza have been growing louder, with UN aid agencies warning they were "on their knees".Israel launched its bombing campaign against Hamas - which Israel, the UK, US and other powers class as a terrorist organisation - in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October.At least 1,400 people were killed and 222 others were taken hostage in the Hamas attack.Gaza's Hamas-run health minister says nearly 5,800 people have been killed in the territory since then.Dozens of MPs have urged the UK government to call for a ceasefire, as five UK nationals remain missing, with some believed to be held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mhairi Black, the SNP's deputy leader in the House of Commons, asked Mr Sunak if he would "join us in calls for a humanitarian ceasefire".Mr Sunak said: "The first and most important principle is that Israel has the right to defend itself under international law."Our support for that position is absolute and unchanged."From the start we've also said that we do want British nationals to be able to leave Gaza, and we want for hostages to be released and for humanitarian aid to get in."We recognise for all of that to happen there has to be a safer environment which of course necessitates specific pauses as distinct from a ceasefire."Ms Black argued that joining calls for a ceasefire was the "best and maybe the only way to stop this conflict escalating beyond all control".But Mr Sunak said Israel has the "right to protect itself" after suffering a "shockingly brutal terrorist attack" at the hands of Hamas.An RAF C-17 aircraft was en route to Egypt from Brize Norton to deliver the British aid to Palestinian civilians.Mr Sunak said: "Our team are on the ground ready to receive, we will continue to do everything we can do increase the flow of aid - including fuel - into Gaza."Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has resisted calls from some of his own MPs to support a full ceasefire.But his spokesman said he would support humanitarian pauses to protect civilians in Gaza."We have said throughout that we would support any initiative to get more aid in and help get hostages out," Sir Keir's spokesman said.	
25/10/2023 09:19:00	Morocco town holds protest to demand aid weeks after earthquake - BBC News	Hundreds of residents of the Moroccan town of Amizmiz have protested against local authorities, weeks after a deadly earthquake destroyed their homes. Amizmiz, located 34 miles (55km) south of Marrakesh, was one of the hardest-hit by the 8 September earthquake.It was the worst to strike Morocco in more than 60 years, killing nearly 3,000 people and leaving thousands more injured and homeless.The residents accuse local authorities of delaying aid and neglecting them.Following the earthquake, authorities put up displaced families in tented camps, accompanied by a promise of financial assistance to help rebuild their homes.But the protesters now say they cannot continue living in the camps as conditions are deteriorating, with heavy rains and winds hitting the region and temperatures dropping as winter approaches.The protesters also accuse local authorities of withholding assistance, including tents, from some of the residents who lost their homes.The protest went ahead on Tuesday despite the withdrawal of the Amizmiz Earthquake Victims' Co-ordination group, which had organised the protest.The group said they had pulled out after local authorities promised to address their concerns.They said that the authorities had promised to speed up assistance, including providing new tents to those who had not previously been given any, and those whose tents had been damaged by the harsh weather.They also pledged to improve sanitation at the camps and provide the displaced with access to water and electricity.Morocco's King Mohammed VI last month announced 120bn Moroccan dirhams ($11.6bn; £9.4bn) over five years to rebuild the regions impacted by the earthquake and support the more than 4.2 million affected people.The plan includes a pledge to grant 140,000 dirhams in reconstruction aid to each household with a collapsed home and 80,000 for each household whose home was partially damaged.Earlier this month, the government said it had started disbursing 2,500 dirhams in monthly assistance to each affected household, as part of a year-long cash relief program.Morocco's government faced criticism from some citizens in the aftermath of the earthquake after it turned down some offers of international aid, despite thousands desperately needing urgent assistance."I think it is really an error [to insist on] sovereignty and national pride. This is not the moment to refuse because the aid is essential, even developed countries accept outside help [in disasters]," activist Maati Mounjib told the BBC's Newsday programme at the time.	
25/10/2023 08:50:00	Israel-Gaza: Sacked Wix worker should seek legal advice, says Varadkar - BBC News	Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said he would encourage a woman sacked over a social media post on the Israel-Gaza war to seek legal advice if her dismissal was related to her political views. Courtney Carey was sacked from Israeli tech company Wix, which employs about 500 people in its Dublin office, after branding Israel "a terrorist state" on social media.She later said she condemns all form of violence, regardless of the perpetrator.Wix's president, Nir Zohar, said the firm was an "open and liberal company" that would "never try to limit anyone's political views".However, he said that the employee was warned after posting something "inflammatory of a similar kind" recently and the firm subsequently "decided to part ways" with Ms Carey. The issue was raised in the Dáil (lower house of the Irish parliament) on Tuesday, where Mr Varadkar said that while he was not aware of the details of the case, he encouraged Ms Carey to seek advice as "under Irish employment law, it is not okay to dismiss somebody because of their political views"."I believe that to be wrong and would encourage the woman concerned to seek advice, whether from the WRC (Workplace Relations Commission), a trade union or a solicitor, because it may well constitute wrongful dismissal and there are remedies that would then apply," he added.On Wednesday, the Irish Times reported that Wix has created an employee group chat, external to "support Israel's narrative" on its internal messaging-app Slack.It said employees had been encouraged to “join a company initiative to create videos and creative campaigns” to “make an impact on global perception" of the Israel-Gaza war.Ms Carey's dismissal was raised in the Dáil by Mick Barry TD, as he called on the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to speak on the case.“It could have a chilling effect on thousands of workers in this country who wish to speak out against a brutal war. It also creates a terrible precedent whereby workers can be fired for expressing a political point of view," he said.Also addressing the Dáil , People Before Profit member Richard Boyd Barrett said he found the case "particularly disturbing".Elsewhere, the Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin has said it would be "unacceptable" for someone to be fired for having an individual viewpoint."We live in a democracy here, we tolerate debate with freedom of speech, freedom of opinion, and people have different opinions on these issues," he told reporters on Tuesday.The discussion comes amid strained diplomatic relations between Ireland and Israel.Speaking to reporters in Italy last week, Irish President Michael D Higgins accused Israel of breaking international law in its retaliation to deadly attacks and kidnappings by the Palestinian group Hamas.Israel's ambassador to Ireland, Dana Erlich, then faced criticism for "unhelpfully" branding Mr Higgins as misinformed.Ms Erlich also questioned Ireland's neutrality on the war, telling the Sunday Independent there was "a strong feeling in Israel that there is an unconscious bias against Israel in Ireland".Elsewhere, a senior Israeli diplomat accused the Republic of Ireland of funding Hamas in a now deleted social media post.Adi Ophir Moaz of the Israeli embassy in Dublin claimed Ireland funded "tunnels of terror" under Gaza in a post on X, formerly Twitter. A spokesperson for the Israeli embassy later said the post was deleted as it "does not represent the official position of Israel or the embassy” and because "the text and wording were wrong".

24/10/2023 20:07:00	Gaza strikes: Hamas-run health ministry says 700 killed in 24 hours - BBC News	More than 700 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, the Hamas-run health ministry says.Israel's military said it struck 400 "terror targets" and killed several Hamas commanders over the same period.It also declared that it would not reduce its attacks despite Hamas's release of another two hostages.UN aid agencies meanwhile pleaded for sustained and safe humanitarian access, warning they were "on their knees".A third of hospitals in Gaza are no longer functioning due to shortages of electricity, medicine and staff, and the shortage of clean water is now critical.Israel launched its bombing campaign against Hamas - which Israel, the UK, US and other powers class as a terrorist organisation - in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October in which at least 1,400 people were killed and 222 others were taken hostage.Nearly 5,800 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the health ministry. Intense Israeli air strikes overnight hit hundreds of locations across Gaza.Some of those killed in the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah were displaced people who had fled the north in response to an Israeli military order to evacuate the area for their own safety, local officials said.They included 13 members of one family from Gaza City, who had been staying in a residential building in Qarara, on the north-eastern outskirts of Khan Younis, where the population has swelled from 400,000 to 1.2 million.A relative who survived said: "We were sleeping and suddenly a big explosion happened. All of my family are dead." The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf says there was grief, shock and anger at the city's hospital on Tuesday morning, as bodies were brought out of the mortuary and taken away for burial. Mourners said there was "no safe place" in Gaza.Later, about 20 people were reportedly killed in a strike on a residential building in the heavily-populated Amal area of Khan Younis.The Hamas-run health ministry said it had been the deadliest 24 hours of the war so far, with 704 people reported killed, including 305 children, 173 women and 78 elderly people. That brought the overall death toll in Gaza to 5,791, it added.The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, said on Tuesday morning that its jets struck "dozens of terror infrastructure and Hamas staging grounds" in several northern areas in and around Gaza City, as well as a "Hamas operational tunnel shaft" near the Mediterranean coastline.It added that aircraft also targeted Hamas command centres and staging grounds located in mosques, killing the deputy commanders of three battalions of Hamas's military wing, and also struck dozens of Hamas gunmen setting up to fire rockets towards Israel."We want to bring Hamas to a state of full dismantling - its leaders, its military branch, and its working mechanisms," IDF Chief of Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi told commanders on Monday. "The path is a path of unrelenting attacks, damaging Hamas everywhere and in every way."He also said that Israeli troops massing near the Gaza perimeter fence were "well prepared for the ground operations" - a reference to the invasion expected soon. The general spoke before Hamas released two elderly Israeli women - Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, and Nurit Cooper, 79 - who were taken as hostages from the Nir Oz kibbutz close to Gaza on 7 October. Others living there were killed and the women's husbands remain among those being held.Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is growing more and more desperate, with shortages of food, water and shelter for the 1.4 million people who have fled their homes. The health ministry warned the territory's healthcare system could collapse and 12 of the 32 hospitals in Gaza were out of service. The others were running out of fuel and only running the most essential services. A spokeswoman the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, which runs the largest humanitarian operation in Gaza, warned that it had also almost exhausted its fuel stocks."If we do not get fuel urgently, we will be forced to halt our operations in the Gaza Strip as of Wednesday night," Juliette Touma told the BBC.At a briefing in Geneva, UNRWA said just 54 lorries of aid had been allowed to cross through the Egyptian-controlled Rafah crossing since 21 October. Before that, Gaza had been receiving around 500 lorries a day. Access once the limited supplies are allowed in is also challenging. The UN has not received the necessary security guarantees to allow aid to be delivered across Gaza, including to the north, where thousands of people, some of them severely injured, remain despite Israel's evacuation order.The World Health Organization warned that while some medical supplies had been allowed in they were not enough to meet the needs. Medical personnel standing by in Egypt have also not been allowed to accompany the supplies. The WHO stressed that fuel, which has so far not been allowed in, was essential for desalination plants, bakeries and hospitals. The shortage of clean water is now critical, as people only have access to between 1 and 3 litres (34-101 fl oz) of water per day. The basic minimum is 15 litres per day, according to the WHO.The World Food Programme said it had reduced food rations in an effort to ensure it was reaching as many people as possible. Emad Abuaassi, who moved from Blackpool in England to northern Gaza with his wife and four children 10 months ago, told the BBC in a voice note that they were now living in a two-bedroom flat in Khan Younis with about 50 other people."We're struggling for everything. We've just managed to have half a sandwich - me and my kids this morning," he said. "The queue is half a mile for a bag of bread.""I don't know what's going to happen in the next two or three days."Israel has agreed to limited deliveries of aid other than fuel, saying that could be stolen and exploited by Hamas for military purposes. An IDF spokesman posted a satellite photo showing 12 fuel tanks near Rafah which he said contained hundreds of thousands of litres of diesel belonging to Hamas. He alleged that the group "steals the diesel from the civilians and transfers it to tunnels, [rocket] launchers and senior officials".Writing on X (formerly known as Twitter) the Israeli military told UNRWA: "Ask Hamas if you can have some."Additional reporting by Imogen Foulkes in Geneva	
24/10/2023 18:34:00	Scottish Labour leader Sarwar says Israel 'breaking international law' in Gaza - BBC News	The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has accused Israel of a "clear breach" of international law in Gaza. He told the BBC there was "no justification for the withholding of essential supplies" from the people of Gaza. His comments came amid resignations within the party over Sir Keir Starmer's stance on the crisis.The Labour leader has repeatedly insisted Israel has a right to defend itself within international law.More than 1,400 Israelis have been killed since Hamas launched its attack on 7 October, according to Israeli authorities - the vast majority in the initial assault. More than 220 are believed to have been taken hostage inside Gaza.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 5,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel's air strikes began in response, and according to the Palestinian health ministry in the occupied West Bank, 91 Palestinians have been killed there since 7 October.Speaking after an Institute for Government event in London, Mr Sarwar said: "There is no justification for the withholding of essential supplies; water, electricity, medicine and food from the people of Gaza. It is a clear breach of international law.""There is no grey area. International law is clear. Withholding of water, energy and essential supplies is a breach of international law and therefore there must be a immediate humanitarian corridor opened so that is accessed by the people in Gaza."He said he made his remarks "whilst unequivocally condemning Hamas" and called for "a de-escalation of violence" and the end of  "rocket fire coming into and out of Gaza"."We must condemn Hamas but we cannot pretend that Hamas is the Palestinian people," he added.Mr Sarwar's comments come amid a number of resignations of Labour party members and elected officials across the UK, including 15 officials in Scotland.Nine officers in a Glasgow ward, including a Labour peer, and six in Edinburgh stood down earlier this week.The Glasgow Kelvin officers accused Scottish Labour of "stifling democracy" after a motion calling for an end to military action was ruled out of order.Asked about Labour officers resigning their positions in Glasgow and Edinburgh constituency Labour parties (CLPs), Mr Sarwar said he disputed claims the party was stifling debate."I don't want to trivialise the issue by talking about individual CLPs… it's being talked about nationally and right across the country," he said.Two councillors who resigned from the party in Oxford have objected to comments made by Sir Keir on a radio programme earlier this month.Pressed at the time on whether cutting off water and power supplies into Gaza would be appropriate as part of an Israeli response, he said: "I think that Israel does have that right, it is an ongoing situation."Obviously, everything should be done within international law, but I don't want to step away from the core principles that Israel has a right to defend herself," he added.Sir Keir later clarified those comments by explaining he was speaking about Israel's right to defend itself, not to cut off power and water, and that Israel should respond within international law.Meanwhile, the first minister has said his mother-in-law, who is stuck in Gaza, has "lost hope".Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband Maged travelled to the region before the Hamas attack and subsequent Israeli reprisals left them trapped.In a statement in the Scottish Parliament, Humza Yousaf reiterated calls for a ceasefire, an increase in aid and a global refugee settlement scheme to be created for those who wish to flee.Speaking about his in-laws, Mr Yousaf said he and his wife Nadia could barely sleep for worry."Throughout the day, the 100 people in the family home must ration their food. The adults barely eat, my mother-in-law only ate cashew nuts yesterday, they ration so the children in the house don't end up malnourished, but time is running out," he said."I spoke to my mother-in-law this morning. She feels helpless and has lost hope. She told me she feels as if the UK Government has forgotten about her."Please don't interpret my point as a political one, it is not," he added.Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said his party "stands with Israel", but also with civilians in Gaza, saying: "The Palestinian people are not Hamas."They are civilians, they are innocent, they are simply caught in a terrible situation. And they are also suffering from the tyranny, exploitation and oppression of Hamas terrorists."Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton praised the "quiet dignity" with which the First Minister has carried himself since the Hamas attack, saying that both those in Gaza and Israel "have the right to live free from fear"	
24/10/2023 15:20:00	In Gaza's crowded Khan Younis, 90 people shelter in one house - BBC News	Ibrahim AlAgha and his wife Hamida had been enjoying an extended holiday in Gaza when Israeli air strikes on the territory began.The couple, who are Irish citizens, had wanted their three Dublin-born children to get to know their Palestinian relatives and learn about the language and culture. But instead of the relaxed family gatherings they had expected to round off their trip, the family had to contend with strikes and explosions.  "It was... constant bombing, bombing, bombing and the house [was] shaking," Ibrahim says. Israel launched retaliatory strikes on Gaza after an attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October killed at least 1,400 people. So far, 9,000 people in Gaza have also been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. After Israel told 1.1 million people to head south ahead of an expected ground invasion, the family packed up their belongings in their apartment in Gaza City and left. They took shelter in Ibrahim's parents' house in the southern city of Khan Younis. As more people fled south, they were joined by relatives and friends with no place to stay and the house is now home to 90 people. His family, Ibrahim says, would never turn anybody away. Life for 90 in a four-bedroom home is not easy. The group moved some of the furniture outside to make room for makeshift beds. They sleep in shifts, with two to a mattress. Ibrahim, an engineer, removed the windows from their frames to prevent glass from injuring people in the event of a possible drone attack. But with food, water and electricity in short supply in Gaza, no-one can ever relax."From the time we wake up to the time we sleep, we're just trying to survive," he says. Some of the group try to go out every day to see if canned food is being distributed. Though they can bake bread in a neighbour's wood oven with their dwindling supplies of wheat, there is not enough for more than one meal a day. The shortages are especially hard on the 30 children - 10 of whom are under five."They always ask for food and water, and we're trying to get them as much as we can... It's very difficult."Elderly people, we can bear it a bit, we can stay hungry, but when children are asking for food we can't say no to them."The house is attached to a farm, which has a well. The group has managed to extract water from it using an electric generator and though it is salty and unfiltered, Ibrahim says they have no option but to drink it. He is concerned about the health of the group, which includes a pregnant woman and an elderly diabetic man who he says will run out of medicine soon. If anyone gets seriously ill, he fears the group will not be able to get medical attention for them in Gaza's crowded hospitals. And Ibrahim's own children have been deeply affected by the events. Omar and Eileen - aged just three and four - get frightened when they hear a strike or an explosion, and Ibrahim and his wife try to distract them by playing games and reading stories. At night, the commotion can interrupt their sleep and they sometimes wake up screaming. Eight-year-old Sami is missing his teacher and his school in north Dublin and is scared by the worsening situation. "He understands what's going on… he can hear and feel the frustration we are going through and he is really worried."While conditions in Gaza deteriorate, Ibrahim and his family have been trying their best to get back to Dublin and are in contact with the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs about an evacuation. On Saturday, they took a "very risky" journey from Khan Younis to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt - one of the two land routes out of the Gaza Strip. Thousands of people have gathered there to try to leave Gaza. But when they got to the border, Ibrahim says they received a message from the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv instructing them to turn back because the Rafah crossing was not going to open. Now he worries he might not have enough fuel to be able to reach the border again if another evacuation plan goes ahead. Even if he does have fuel, he may lose communication with the embassy if phone networks die. "I'm starting to lose hope," he says. The Irish Deputy Prime Minister Micheál Martin has said the government is working to assist Irish citizens in Gaza. In the meantime, the family face an agonising wait. After an explosion hit the Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday, in which hundreds are feared to have been killed, Ibrahim says no-one in their crowded Khan Younis house could sleep. "We are really fearing for our lives... there's no limits… anyone, anywhere could be targeted. "Things are getting worse every day."	
24/10/2023 14:46:00	Gaza family tell of desperate journeys to border in search of safety - BBC News	A father-of-four in Gaza has told of his family's repeated desperate attempts to reach the border with Egypt in the hope of escaping to safety.Emad Abuaassi fled from the north with his wife and children as the Israel airstrikes began. In voice notes sent to the BBC, Mr Abuaassi said they had tried in vain to cross the closed Rafah crossing, driving with rockets flying overhead."Every time we go there, we just suffer," he said. "I can't explain anymore how it is. Absolute disaster. I have never seen or experienced anything like this in all our lives."The family moved from Blackpool in Lancashire to the Gaza Strip, where members of Mr Abuaassi's family still live, just under a year ago. His wife and children have British passports.Since fleeing the north, they have been staying in Mr Abuassi's brother's flat in the city of Khan Younis.Still more than eight miles from the Rafah crossing, he told how the family had made "four or five" perilous drives to get there in the hope of being allowed to cross. "The dangerous bit is to reach the border. And the dangerous bit again is to get back home from the border," he said. "Every time we go there, we just suffer. All day in the sun and rockets fly over our heads."I don't want to go unless we know for definite the border is open."Speaking on Monday, Mr Abuaassi's wife Stephanie told how "nowhere is safe".It has now been almost three weeks since Hamas launched its unprecedented attacks on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,800 people."We can't get out. We're living here in a two-bedroom flat [with] about 50 people," Mr Abuaassi said. "The situation is absolutely bad. We're struggling for food, we're struggling for water, we're struggling for everything. "We've just managed to have half a sandwich - me and my kids this morning. "All our flat was destroyed, everything destroyed," he said. "We managed to get out with just a tiny bit of money and just quickly ran to the hospital. "We slept in the hospital the whole night. "The next morning my brother came and he took us to his flat in Khan Younis and now we remain here but the situation is difficult and I hope something happens soon."The Gaza Strip only has two other border crossings, both with Israel - Erez, a crossing for people in northern Gaza and Kerem Shalom, a solely commercial goods junction in southern Gaza. Both remain shut.Mr Abuaassi said every day was getting "more difficult" as food supplies dwindled. "Everyone is starving here, day by day, life is getting difficult and difficult," he continued. "I don't know what's going to happen over the next two, three days."[But] we are better than other people. Some people can't even have somewhere to sleep, or some food or water. "At least we are kind of safe. We're lucky we got a bit of food and water and somewhere to stay. It's a really difficult situation here."He urged the British Embassy to help, adding: "I hope the British Embassy can do something for us to get out of Gaza as soon as possible."Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

24/10/2023 14:26:00	Dubai police in Dublin to discuss Kinahan crime gang - BBC News	Senior police officers from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are in Dublin as part of an international investigation into the Kinahan crime group.Irish broadcaster RTÉ has reported that three senior Dubai officers met Garda (Irish police) Commissioner Drew Harris on Tuesday, prior to a further meeting with the force's Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Harris said that police in Dubai has already provided "great assistance" with their "ongoing investigations into transnational organised crime".The support from this delegation "will further advance that co-operation", he added.The investigation is examining links between the Kinahans' finances and the largest drugs seizure in the history of the Irish state.Officials recovered more than two tonnes of cocaine after storming a Panamanian-registered ship, MV Matthew, last month.The delegation's visit comes one day after the Irish justice minister, Helen McEntee, discussed the possibility of a bilateral treaty on extradition with her UAE counterpart.The ministers also discussed the possibility of mutual legal assistance and the transfer of sentenced prisoners.Speaking after the meeting, Ms McEntee said: "Our productive conversation this morning follows the visit of Garda Commissioner Drew Harris to Dubai last month to meet with Lieutenant General Abdullah Khalifa Al Marri, in addition to Irish officials travelling to the UAE for high level meetings in recent weeks."We are working to build upon the positive coalitions built by An Garda Síochána to tackle transnational crime, and are determined that borders will not be barriers to effective criminal justice co-operation,” she continued.The Regency Hotel murder in 2016 focussed public attention on the Kinahan gang and revealed its international links.For more than 20 years the group has been responsible for importing tonnes of drugs and firearms around the world, the National Crime Agency says.It is Ireland's wealthiest, most powerful and ruthless criminal gang.The US Treasury Department describes the Kinahan cartel as one of the most dangerous in the world, comparable to crime organisations such as Italy's Camorra, Mexico's Los Zetas and Japan's Yakuza.According to Garda Commissioner Drew Harris, the gang is estimated to have made more than €1bn (£852,629,000) globally from its activities.The Kinahan gang was founded by Christy Kinahan Sr but it is believed its day-to-day operations are now controlled by sons Daniel, in particular, and Christopher Jr.In recent years Daniel Kinahan also got involved in high-profile boxing.In April 2022 the US Federal Bureau of Investigations put up rewards of $5m (£3.8m) for the capture of the three men.Daniel Kinahan has previously been named in the Irish courts as the head of one of Europe's most prominent drug gangs.His father Christopher Snr and brother Christopher Jnr were also placed on an Office of Foreign Assets Control list.	
24/10/2023 13:32:00	Tanzanian family's desperate search for missing student in Israel - BBC News	The father of a 21-year-old Tanzanian, who has been missing since Hamas militants attacked the kibbutz he was living on in Israel, has told the BBC of his anguish, naming his son publicly for the first time."The last time I spoke to Joshua was Thursday 5 October," says his father Loitu Mollel. "I said, 'Be on your best behaviour because you're somewhere new, and make the most of the internship you're there to do.'"Two days later Joshua Mollel's new home - Kibbutz Nahal Oz - was attacked by Hamas. He had left his family's place in northern Tanzania just the previous month.Boarding the plane was a moment of excitement for Joshua.Not only was this his first time travelling abroad - it was also a big step towards making his ambitions a reality."My son wants to make his fortune in agribusiness and become one of Tanzania's most successful farmers," his father says proudly.He and his wife hope Joshua's studies in Israel will eventually boost the modest incomes they make from teaching and growing crops.Being the eldest child, Joshua's younger brother and sisters look up to him as role model - so it hurts that they have not spoken to him on the phone for weeks.On 7 October dozens of residents were massacred in Kibbutz Nahal Oz, and hostages taken over the border to Gaza which lies just 800m away.Nobody knows what became of Joshua, and his family are sick with worry."We can't eat or sleep - when I go to the market people ask me why I'm losing so much weight," says his father."When the news came that Israel had been attacked by Hamas, I tried to find out if Israel had an embassy in Tanzania but I was told that they operate from Kenya. "So instead I contacted the Tanzanian foreign ministry and I even contacted Tanzania's ambassador in Tel Aviv."But I've still received no information about where my child is and in what condition."Neither Tanzania nor Israel have confirmed the identities of two Tanzanians students who are known to be missing.But the BBC has worked to establish who they are, speaking to their families to confirm details about their lives. We know that Joshua Mollel is one of the two missing students, and we know the identity of the other - but their parents have chosen not to name them publicly."We are working in support of the Israel authorities to find out where the two missing students are," says Tanzania's ambassador in Tel Aviv, Alex Kallua. "We can't tell if they are held hostage or even otherwise because we are looking for the correct information."The BBC has also contacted Israel's foreign ministry with a request for comment.Some 350 Tanzanians live in Israel, 70% of whom are students mostly pursuing agricultural-related studies, according to Tanzanian officials.Ambassador Kallua says nine Tanzanians have returned to their home country safely within the last week, and that his embassy staff are "keen to make sure that we are in touch with the other Tanzanians [who are still] in Israel and making sure all are safe".Joshua's family says his internship at Nahal Oz's dairy farm in Israel was organised by his college in central Tanzania, the Ministry of Agriculture Training Institute - Katrin. The college has not replied to the BBC's request for comment."We do not want to stand and blame the authorities for the slow search for my grandson, because we understand some parts of Israel were attacked by Hamas," Joshua's grandfather, Ephata Nanyaro, says diplomatically.But this does not lessen the family's pain."He was last seen online on [the messaging app] WhatsApp on 7 October at around 10:00 [07:00 GMT] in the morning," recalls Joshua's father. "I'm so stressed... It is really difficult. My little girls ask me every morning and night: 'Dad, we want to talk to our brother.'"But I don't have any answers to give." 	
24/10/2023 13:12:00	I went through hell, says elderly hostage released by Hamas - BBC News	"I went through hell," says Yocheved Lifschitz, an 85-year-old grandmother and peace activist released by Hamas on Monday after two weeks in captivity.Ms Lifschitz and her husband were kidnapped by Hamas gunmen on motorbikes and taken into a "spider's web" of tunnels underneath Gaza, she said.She described being hit by sticks on the journey, but said most of the hostages were being "treated well".She was freed alongside another woman, Nurit Cooper, 79, on Monday evening.Extraordinary images show the grandmother shaking the hand of a Hamas gunman, just seconds before she was handed over to the International Red Cross at the Rafah crossing between Gaza and neighbouring Egypt. "Shalom," she appears to say to the gunman - the Hebrew word for peace.Ms Lifschitz was kidnapped, alongside her husband Oded, from Nir Oz Kibbutz in southern Israel on 7 October. He has not been released.It was early in the morning when Hamas attacked their kibbutz, massacring the small community. One in four residents are believed to have been killed or kidnapped, including many children.Speaking at a news conference from Ichilov hospital in Tel Aviv just a few hours after her release, Ms Lifschitz explained what happened after she was kidnapped.She said she was hit with sticks during the journey into Gaza, and suffered bruises and breathing difficulties.Her daughter, Sharone Lifschitz, who helped translate her mother's ordeal to reporters, said the 85-year-old was forced to walk for a few kilometres on wet ground. Sharone said her mother was taken into "a huge network of tunnels underneath Gaza that looked like a spider's web".Ms Lifschitz said she was among 25 hostages taken into the tunnels and after several hours, five people from her kibbutz, including herself, were taken into a separate room. There, they each had a guard and access to a paramedic and doctor.She described clean conditions inside, with mattresses on the floor for them to sleep on. Another captive who was badly injured in a motorbike accident on the way into Gaza was treated for his injuries by a doctor. "They made sure we wouldn't get sick, and we had a doctor with us every two or three days."She also said they had access to medicines they needed and there were women there who knew about "feminine hygiene".They ate the same food - pitta bread with cheese and cucumber - as the Hamas guards, her daughter Sharone added.Asked by a reporter why she had shaken hands with the gunman, Ms Lifschitz said the hostage takers had treated her well and the remaining hostages were in good condition.Sharone said she wasn't surprised by her mother's gesture - "the way she walked off and then came back and then said thank you was quite incredible to me. It's so her," she earlier told the BBC.Hours before Ms Lifschitz and Nurit Cooper were released on Monday evening, the Israeli military held a screening for journalists showing raw footage recovered from Hamas body cameras, in an effort to remind the world of the brutality of the attack on Israel two weeks ago.Among the clips was footage of Hamas gunmen cheering with apparent joy as they shot civilians on the road, and later stalking the pathways of kibbutzim and killing parents and children in their homes.More than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the attack.Ms Lifschitz and her 83-year-old husband, Oded, are known peace activists who helped transport sick people out of Gaza to hospitals in Israel, according to their families. Oded is a journalist who's worked for peace and the rights of Palestinians for decades, Sharone told the BBC. According to the National Union of Journalists, he used to work for newspaper Al Hamishmar, and was among the first journalists to report on the massacre in two Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut in 1982."He speaks good Arabic so can communicate very well with the people there. He knows many people in Gaza. I want to think he's going to be OK," says Sharone.In total, four hostages have now been released, after two American-Israelis, mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan, were freed on Friday.Israel says more than 200 people are still being held hostage. The husband of Nurit Cooper, who was also freed on Monday night, is believed to be among them.	
24/10/2023 09:39:00	Brussels shooting: Gunman who killed two Swedes had escaped Tunisian prison - BBC News	A gunman who shot dead two Swedish football fans in Brussels last Monday had escaped from prison in Tunisia. Belgian prosecutors say Abdesalem Lassoued had been sentenced to 26 years in prison in 2005, reportedly for crimes including attempted murder.He escaped in 2011, managed to board a small boat and arrived illegally on the Italian island of Lampedusa. Lassoued eventually moved to Belgium, where he applied for asylum. When rejected, he fell off the radar. The Tunisian authorities had asked Belgium to return Lassoued home in August 2022. Belgian officials received the extradition request, but failed to process it. On Tuesday, French authorities said they had detained two men over possible links to Lassoued as part of an investigation into a suspected "criminal terrorist conspiracy". Belgium's Justice Minister Vincent Van Quickenborne resigned on Friday over what he called a "monumental and unacceptable error with dramatic consequences".On the evening of Monday 16 October, Lassoued, a 45-year-old man from Tunisia, started shooting at passers-by with an assault rifle in central Brussels. He then chased people into the hallway of an apartment building, where he shot and killed two Swedish football fans, and injured a third. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack.After a manhunt the gunman was tracked down at a cafe near his home in Schaerbeek, northern Brussels, on Tuesday morning. He was shot dead by police."I sincerely want to apologise to the victims and their loved ones," Mr Van Quickenborne said during his resignation speech. "I am not looking for any excuses."He said he wanted to take "political responsibility for this unacceptable mistake".Brussels public prosecutor Tim De Wolf blamed understaffing in his office for the failure to act on the extradition request.He said the extradition file had been received in September last year and had probably been forgotten in a file cabinet."None of the colleagues involved remember what became of this specific file a year ago. There is no trace of it being handled," he said.The prosecutor did not mention why Lassoued had been jailed, but Belgian media are reporting that he was imprisoned for two attempted murders.The attacker had lodged asylum applications in Norway, Sweden, Belgium and Italy. In 2016, the Italian intelligence services identified him as a radicalised subject and started to monitor him.It also emerged that Lassoued had served a two-year prison sentence in Sweden for drug trafficking. According to Swedish media, he was arrested in Malmo for possessing 100g (3.5oz) of cocaine.The attack in Brussels, which resulted in the death of a man in his 70s and a man in his 60s, has shocked Sweden."I think this is one of the first times Swedes have been targeted like this because of their nationality," Maja, a dual Swedish-British citizen who lives in Brussels, told the BBC.Following a string of Quran burnings by anti-Islam activists in Sweden, the government has been warning of a heightened risk to Swedish nationals.Copies of the Muslim holy book have been burned outside embassies, mosques, and the Swedish parliament.This has sparked angry reactions in Muslim countries, and in August the terror alert was raised to the second-highest level following threats by Islamic extremists. "I always thought that having a Swedish passport was such a positive thing," Maja said. "But times have really changed."The Swedish Security Service, known as Sapo, said it was "working closely with the Belgian authorities".The shooting is being treated by the Belgian prosecutor as a terrorist attack - and comes at a time of heightened security concerns across Europe linked to the Israel-Hamas war.Belgium has announced extra security measures in response to last week's attack. The public prosecutor's office in Brussels, federal judicial police and railway police will all get additional staff. The flow of information between the immigration service, the police and the judiciary will also be strengthened. 	
24/10/2023 07:55:00	Two more hostages held in Gaza released - BBC News	Israel has confirmed that two more hostages in Gaza have been released by Hamas, bringing the number freed so far to four.The two women have been named as Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifschitz, 85. Their husbands are still being held.Israel thanked Egypt for its assistance and the Red Cross for the "important role" it played. Hamas said it freed the hostages on humanitarian and health grounds, but that Israel refused to receive them.The two women were kidnapped from their homes in Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas during their 7 October attack on southern Israel.Following their release, they were transported to a hospital in Tel Aviv, where family members were waiting for them, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Ms Lifschitz's daughter, Sharone Lifschitz, said seeing her mum again "is an incredible thing"."Just to hold her hand, just to kiss her face and her cheek, and I'm so proud of her. She's amazing."She said her mother had been asleep during her first visit, but added that her nurse had said "she's very sharp and she's very keen to share the information."Sharone - who lives in London - said she has had no news of her father, Oded, who she said worked with a local organisation to drive wounded Palestinians to hospital."There's many people that tried to do that," she said, adding "it's a twist of history that these communities that were really peace-loving communities are the ones to sustain such a horrendous massacre."She added that her father speaks Arabic and knows many people in Gaza and so hopes that will help him.Despite the situation, Sharone has faith the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas will end. "I don't think there's a conflict that hasn't been resolved. We have come out of the Holocaust," she said."Our capacity to understand what has happened to us, the level of atrocities, is just phenomenal."A video released by Hamas on Monday evening appears to show the moment the two elderly hostages were delivered, in the dark, to representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross.Yocheved Lifschitz can be heard identifying herself and confirming her age. Then, before leaving, she turns to a masked Hamas gunman, shakes his hand and says "shalom".Israel said that Ms Cooper's husband Amiram, 85, and Ms Lifschitz's husband Oded, 83, were still being held by Hamas, and that it would continue to "work in every way" for their release.Israel says Hamas seized more than 200 hostages in their attacks on 7 October.Hamas gunmen also killed more than 1,400 people in areas of the country bordering Gaza, causing shock and outrage.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 5,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel began bombing the territory in response, flattening entire neighbourhoods.Two American-Israelis, mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan, were released from captivity on Friday.Earlier on Monday, there were reports that as many as 50 foreign and dual nationals could be freed through Qatari mediation.A source briefed on the talks denied that leak, but said the "talks are ongoing about a full civilian release but no breakthrough yet". Hamas has spoken of releasing more hostages in exchange for a ceasefire and the entry of more aid into Gaza. Israel has ruled out any ceasefire as it intensifies its military operations.	
24/10/2023 02:04:00	The Thais caught up in the Israel-Gaza war - BBC News	In a village lying close to the Mekong River, Weerapon "Golf" Lapchan sits in the centre of a group of Thai elders as they tie white threads around his wrists and chant. They are literally calling his "kwan" or spirit back to his body, after his narrow escape during the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October.The 34-year-old is one of more than 25,000 Thais who were working on farms and orchards in Israel when the Hamas militants stormed in from Gaza. At least 30 Thais were among the 200 or so foreign nationals who were killed in the attack. Now the Thai government is helping others, thousands of them, to return home. Thailand provides almost all the foreign farm labour in Israel. And there have been warnings of dire consequences for the country's agricultural economy if large numbers of Thais choose to stay away after the Hamas attack. Many of the Thai workers have to borrow money to go to Israel and now they are returning, jobless and in debt.  Yet some like Golf never want to go back. On the morning of 7 October, when Golf and his co-workers saw rockets being fired, and then intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defence system, he says they were not unduly worried. Golf had been working at an orange orchard in Yesha, just 5km (three miles) from the border with Gaza, for nearly a year. He had experienced rockets flying overhead before. When they heard gunfire, however, they realised it was more serious, and hid most of that day. In the evening, says Golf, the Hamas attackers returned, throwing grenades and setting the rooms where they were hiding alight. He and 11 others made a run for it. "We jumped over the wall, and they shot at us from behind. Bang, bang, bang, bang." He says he was wearing only a pair of red boxer shorts when he ran to the middle of the orchard. He and the others crouched down, turning off their phones so the attackers couldn't see the light. "We were all shocked and kept quiet all night - so quiet that we could hear the falling leaves," he says. Golf was brought back to Thailand on a government-organised evacuation flight on 13 October. He has decided he will not go back, no matter what he might be offered. Death was just seconds away that day, he says. All 12 of them have decided that they never want to face that again.At least 19 Thai workers are believed to have been abducted by Hamas, with many more still missing.  In another village to the north, Narissara Chanthasang has had no news of her husband Nattapong since the morning of the attack. He had phoned her to tell her there was shooting, and that he was running away.He left her and his six-year-old son in June last year to work on an avocado and pomegranate farm in the Nir Oz kibbutz, not far from where Golf was working. Nir Oz was one of the communities worst affected by the attack. One in four of those who lived there are believed to have been killed or kidnapped by the militants, including many children. Narissara's only hope is that Nattapong may have been abducted, although he is not on the government's list of Thai hostages. People have always moved away from north-eastern Thailand in search of work. The mainly rural region is one of the poorest in the country, where rice farming provides only a bare subsistence living and well-paid jobs are scarce. More than 80% of Thai workers in Israel are from the north-east. They started going to Israel in the 1980s and the arrangement was formalised in an agreement between the two governments in 2011. It has not been without controversy. Human rights and labour groups have in the past complained about the Thais being overworked in unsafe conditions. People told the BBC they have to pay significantly more than the official fees of around 70,000 baht ($2,100) to get to Israel - often up to 120,000 baht including extra costs and unofficial payments. But they also say they can earn seven to eight times more than in Thailand. Some praised their Israeli employers for looking after them and paying them on time. "Partly it's about improving their social status," says Poonnatree Jiaviriyaboonya, an anthropologist at Nakhon Phanom University. "Those who came back from working overseas get more respect. They seem more cosmopolitan, more educated. But in reality, [they] are still poor migrant workers, poor rice farmers who have been neglected by the government. We need to shake up our policies for developing this region so people do not have to leave their families and go overseas."The debts they have incurred are a worry for those who have come back early. They borrow money against their land or their house - and they normally work in Israel for at least five years, so they can pay off what they owe. Golf's younger sister took out a loan for him to go last year. Narissara's mother mortgaged her rice-fields to raise the 200,000 baht they needed to send Nattapong to Israel.This is weighing on the mind of Anusorn Kamang, a 25-year-old whose mother also mortgaged her land for him to go to Israel. He spent a harrowing few days under constant rocket attack at the organic vegetable farm where he was working, before borrowing more money for his flight home. The Thai government has promised to reimburse that cost, but his mother's debt is still there, and he is thinking about going back, once the fighting stops."I earned a lot in Israel, and my employer was good to me. Working here won't get me anywhere. It's enough for food, but that's all. I want a house and a car. I have none of that yet."	
25/10/2023 13:00:00	Netanyahu says Israel preparing for Gaza ground invasion but won't say when - BBC News		
23/10/2023 22:34:00	Week 3: BBC correspondents answer your questions on the conflict between Israel and Hamas - BBC News	It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people. Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen. The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers: Israel said it was imposing a "complete siege" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this "humanitarian for humanitarian".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Rosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas ("mowing the grass" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: "Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank."Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified "Western position" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far."Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.	
23/10/2023 18:44:00	Rishi Sunak says Al-Ahli hospital blast likely caused by missile from Gaza - BBC News	Rishi Sunak says the UK has judged that the blast at Gaza's Al-Ahli hospital was likely caused by "a missile, or part of one" fired from "within Gaza".The PM said the conclusion was based on the "deep knowledge and analysis of our intelligence and weapons experts".Media outlets, including the BBC, reported an initial Hamas statement blaming Israel for Tuesday's explosion.Israel denied this shortly afterwards, saying that it was caused by a misfiring rocket from within Gaza.Mr Sunak told the House of Commons: "On the basis of the deep knowledge and analysis of our intelligence and weapons experts, the British government judges that the explosion was likely caused by a missile, or part of one, that was launched from within Gaza towards Israel."Mr Sunak said that "misreporting" of the blast had had a "negative effect in the region"."We need to learn the lessons and ensure that in future there is no rush to judgement," he said.Regional leaders cancelled a meeting with US President Joe Biden in the aftermath of the explosion.Mr Biden has since backed the Israeli assessment of the incident.Mr Sunak also said the UK would give a further £20 million of humanitarian aid to Gaza, doubling its earlier funding. He said Palestinians were suffering, and called them "victims of Hamas". He added that "we need to invest more deeply in regional stability and in the two-state solution" to the conflict, which would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.The prime minister said there  was"no scenario" where Hamas could be allowed to "control Gaza or any part of the Palestinian territories".He also made mention of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. "It is a same motivation that drives [Vladimir] Putin's war on Ukraine, the fear of Ukraine's emergence as a modern, thriving democracy and a desire to pull it back into some imperialist fantasy of the past. Putin will fail and so will Hamas," he said. He also condemned the use of the word "jihad" at a pro-Palestinian protest in London over the weekend. A video posted online appeared to show a man shouting the word at a separate event from the main pro-Palestine march."Calls for jihad on our streets are not only a threat to the Jewish community but to our democratic values and we expect the police to take all necessary action to tackle extremism head-on," he said. Opposition leader Keir Starmer said humanitarian corridors must be established for civilians in Gaza trying to escape violence.He said basic human needs like water, food and medicine must not be denied to people who need them."Gaza needs aid and it needs to be rapid, safe, unhindered and regular," he said.The first aid convoys reached Gaza through the border with Egypt over the weekend - 20 lorries on Saturday and 14 on Sunday.The UN said much more was needed and the Rafah border crossing is still not open for foreign nationals seeking to flee Gaza.Israel says that more than 1,400 people were killed when Hamas attacked communities near Gaza on 7 October, shooting civilians dead in their homes, in the streets and at a music festival.Gaza's health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, says more than 5,000 people have been killed in the enclave.At least 10 British nationals were among those killed in the Hamas attacks.Yosef Guedalia, 22, is the latest British-Israeli named as being killed by Hamas. The soldier was part of an anti-terror unit when he was killed confronting Hamas gunmen at Kibbutz Kfar Aza.	
23/10/2023 18:30:00	Some Gazans returning to north despite risks, UN says - BBC News	Some Palestinians who fled their homes in the north of Gaza are starting to return because of the dire situation in the south, a senior UN official says.Israel told 1.1 million residents of Gaza City and other northern areas to leave for their own safety last week.But the UN official said they were struggling to find shelter, food and drinking water in the south.The Hamas-run health ministry also said hundreds had been killed there in Israeli air strikes over the past day.The Israeli military said it had hit hundreds of military targets belonging to Hamas across Gaza, as it stepped up its air campaign ahead of an expected ground offensive.More than 5,000 people are now reported to have been killed across the Strip, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, since Israel began its bombardment in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas on 7 October, in which at least 1,400 people were killed and 222 taken hostage.Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday. The UN estimates that almost two thirds of Gaza's population - 1.4 million people - have fled their homes over the past two weeks either out of fear or because their homes have been destroyed or damaged.The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf in Khan Younis says the southern city has been overwhelmed by the influx of between 600,000 and 700,000 displaced people, with many sheltering inside hospitals, clubs and restaurants, or even forced to sleep in the streets.The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC that most displaced people were living off just 1 litre (34 fl oz) of water and one or two small rounds of Arabic bread a day.The humanitarian crisis, combined with continued strikes on civilian areas in the south, meant that "some people are going back to the north", he said."Essentially, people have left everything in the north - their houses, their businesses, their lives. They've come to the south where they are struggling to find shelter, food is scarce, many people are having to drink unpotable water, so the situation in the south is dire."Riyad Jaabas, a displaced man staying in Khan Younis, told Reuters news agency: "We were expelled from Gaza City. They said Khan Younis is a safe area, now there is no safe space in all Gaza."On Saturday, leaflets dropped over Gaza City by the Israeli military warned that anyone who did not move south of the Wadi Gaza river "might be identified as an accomplice in a terrorist organisation".And although the UN welcomed the arrival of 34 lorries carrying food, water and medical supplies over the weekend, Mr White warned that hundreds more a day were required to meet Gaza's needs, particularly those carrying fuel."Before the conflict Gaza was receiving about 455 trucks a day, so we've got a long way to go to scale up the logistics operation.""We have about three days left of fuel inside Gaza," he added "This is something that Israel needs to allow to enter Gaza, otherwise our aid operation will come to a halt. Desalinization plants will start running out of water. Hospitals will start having to shut down their wards."Gaza's health ministry warned that the generators at 13 public hospitals were running out of fuel and that they were only running the most essential life-saving services, including incubators helping to keep 130 babies alive.Israel is refusing to allow fuel in, saying it could be stolen and exploited by Hamas for military purposes.An Israeli defence ministry agency said on Sunday that Hamas had "a fuel reserve of 1 million litres". It accused the group of "refusing to hand [fuel] out to facilities in need" and using it for "lighting up their terror tunnels, for rocket launchers, and for their own homes".On Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that its forces had struck 320 targets in Gaza over the past day, including "tunnels containing Hamas terrorists, dozens of operational command centres... military compounds, and observation posts"."Furthermore, the IDF struck targets that posed a threat to forces in the area surrounding the Gaza Strip who are preparing for ground operations, including dozens of mortar shell and anti-tank missile launch posts," it added.Overnight, videos shared on social media showed the blasts of successive Israeli strikes on Gaza lighting up the sky.The director of the Al-Quds hospital in Gaza City told the BBC that there were 10 strikes within 100m (330ft) of the facility, where there were 500 patients and another 1,500 people taking shelter.On Monday afternoon, Gaza's health ministry said 436 people, including 182 children, had been killed in the past 24 hours, most of them in the south.The ministry also announced that the overall death toll in Gaza since Israel began responding to Hamas's cross-border attack had risen to 5,087.The figure includes 471 people who the health ministry said were killed by an explosion at al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City. Hamas blamed an Israeli air strike, but the IDF presented evidence that it said showed the blast was the result of a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. On Monday, the UK government said it had also assessed that the explosion was "likely caused by a missile or part of one that was launched from within Gaza towards Israel", echoing the conclusions of the US, France and Canada.The IDF says 7,000 rockets have been fired towards Israel by Hamas and other groups in Gaza since 7 October, with 550 failing and landing inside Gaza.  	
23/10/2023 18:17:00	Israel shows Hamas bodycam attack footage to journalists - BBC News	This article contains descriptions of violence which some readers may find distressing.The Israeli military held a screening for journalists on Monday of raw footage recovered from Hamas body cameras, in an effort to remind the world of the brutality of the attack on Israel two weeks ago.The bodycam footage, cut together with clips from CCTV, dashboard cameras and the mobile phones of both Hamas gunmen and victims,  showed in stark detail the sheer horror visited on a music festival and family neighbourhoods in southern Israel.The Israeli military also released documents which it said were recovered from dead Hamas members, containing detailed operational planning and instructions for attacking the neighbourhoods and taking hostages. The 43 minutes of footage screened at a military base near Tel Aviv on Monday was distilled from hundreds of hours collected since the attack, the Israeli military said. It contained clips of Hamas gunmen cheering with apparent joy as they shot civilians on the road, and later stalking the pathways of kibbutzim and killing parents and children in their homes.One traumatic sequence, taken from home cameras inside of a kibbutz, showed a father rushing his two young boys into an above ground shelter, seconds before Hamas attackers threw a grenade in, killing the father and wounding the boys.After the two boys, bloodied and in shock, had staggered back into their home screaming, a Hamas gunman calmly entered and looked through the fridge in front of them, pausing to take a drink before walking out again. One of the boys cried to his brother: "Daddy is dead, this is not a prank," and repeated "Why am I alive?" His brother was apparently blinded by the grenade. The military spokesman present at the screening was unable to say whether they survived.The film also contained an audio recording of one of the Hamas gunmen calling home to his parents in Gaza from the phone of a victim to boast that he had "killed at least 10 Jews with my bare hands". "Please open WhatsApp and look how many dead," he implored his parents repeatedly, apparently referring to pictures or video he had sent home showing the attack. "Your son killed so many Jews," he said. "Mum, your son is a hero."WARNING: The following paragraphs contain graphic descriptions of violenceAnother sequence showed one Hamas gunman shooting the apparently dead bodies of civilians inside a kibbutz in a celebratory manner, and an attempt to decapitate someone who appeared to be still alive using a garden hoe.The footage, some taken from mobile phones of victims, also showed the abject fear of those who hid in safe rooms and shelters as the sounds of gunfire and explosions came closer.The decision to screen the raw footage for journalists reflected an apparent frustration among senior ranks of the Israeli military that the media coverage of Hamas's brutal attack on 7 October had given way to coverage of Israel's air strikes against Gaza and the humanitarian crisis created by Israel's order for Gazans to migrate south.Speaking to the assembled international media after the screening, Major General Michael Edelstein, a former IDF Gaza division commander, said he had been "shocked" by the coverage."We see that some of the channels are trying to compare what Israel is doing and what those vile terrorists are doing," General Edelstein said.  "I cannot understand anyone who compares," he said. "And after what we have shared with you, you should know it."More than 1,400 Israelis have been killed since the Hamas attack on 7 October, according to Israeli authorities - the vast majority in the initial assault. More than 220 are believed to have been taken hostage inside Gaza.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 5,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel's air strikes began in response, and according to the Palestinian health ministry in the occupied West Bank, 91 Palestinians have been killed there since 7 October. After the screening of the footage on Monday, a virtual reality experience was available, created using video from the first responders who entered family homes in the kibbutzim targeted by Hamas.The Israeli military also released two instruction manuals taken from dead Hamas gunmen, containing detailed plans for the attack and for taking hostages."They must shoot down as many victims as possible, take hostages and take some of them to the Gaza Strip using various cars," said one part of the manual.In a separate document specifically about hostages, the Hamas operatives were instructed to "kill the problematic and those who pose a threat" and gather others together to use as "cannon fodder". Israel's military is still reeling from the 7 October attack, the worst breach of its defences in the south in 50 years. Despite huge resources being put into destroying Hamas tunnels and expanding Israel's security fence both below ground and out to sea, Hamas was able to storm and breach the fence in huge numbers.More than 1,000 militants crossed into Israel in the initial incursion, General Edelstein said on Monday. The first parts of the video compilation showed groups of pick-up trucks packed with Hamas gunmen, driving freely along Israeli highways and shooting civilians at will.The documents recovered from the bodies of the Hamas militants made it clear that Hamas "came with orders to slaughter and burn citizens", General Edelstein said."They simply decided to burn families within their homes. And they took hostages alive, they were aiming to take children back into Gaza," he said."Orders were there for how many to kill, how many to take as hostages. Orders were there to rape, all was written and ordered."Speaking before the screening, Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that members of the military had debated whether to show the footage, but that he had decided personally to go ahead. "We understand already that we need to create a collective memory for the future," he said. "We will not let the world forget."	
23/10/2023 17:37:00	How far would the US go to defend Israel? - BBC News	The US has pledged its unwavering support to Israel and backed that up with military aid. But with the scars of past entanglements in the region still being felt, where is the limit to US involvement? In his first reaction to the attack on Israel by Hamas, President Biden made clear whose side he's on: "The United States has Israel's back," he said."To anyone thinking of taking advantage of the situation, I have one word: Don't," he added.This warning was clearly aimed at Iran and its allies. US troops in Iraq and Syria have been attacked several times in recent days, the Pentagon says, and a US destroyer in the Red Sea intercepted missiles fired from Yemen which were "potentially" aimed towards Israel.The US already has a carrier strike group in the Eastern Mediterranean, soon to be joined by another in the region. Each aircraft carrier has more than 70 aircraft on board - considerable firepower. Mr Biden has also placed thousands of US troops on standby to move to the region if required. The US is Israel's largest military backer, providing about $3.8bn of defence aid a year. The Israeli jets bombing Gaza are American-made, as are most of the precision-guided munitions now being used. Some of the interceptor missiles for Israel's Iron Dome air defence system are also produced in the US. The US was sending re-supplies of those weapons even before Israel requested them. And on Friday President Biden asked Congress to approve $14bn funding for its Middle Eastern ally's war chest as part of a $105bn (£87bn) military aid package.The following day, the Pentagon announced it would send two of its most powerful missile defence systems to the Middle East - a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery and additional Patriot batteries.But would a US president really be willing to become embroiled in another war, especially in an election year? Recent US military adventures in the region have proved costly - politically, economically and in terms of American lives.Michael Oren, a former US Israeli ambassador to the US, believes President Biden has already taken a first step by moving US aircraft carriers in the region. "You don't take that kind of pistol out unless you're willing to use it," he says.But Seth G Jones, director of International Security at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, says the US would be very reluctant to get directly engaged militarily in a war in Gaza.The presence of the carrier strike groups, he says, could be useful "without firing a shot", not least because of their ability to gather intelligence and to provide air defences. Any engagement would be "a last resort", he says.It is primarily the threat from Israel's north, and specifically from the militant group Hezbollah, which now worries both Israel and the US. The Iranian-backed group is a much greater threat than Hamas in Gaza. It has an arsenal of around 150,000 rockets which are more powerful and accurate than the ones used by Hamas. And it has already exchanged fire with Israel, its sworn enemy.Mr Oren fears Hezbollah could intervene when Israel is "already deep inside Gaza and already committed and tired". If that happens, then Mr Oren believes there is a possibility the US would commit its sizeable airpower to strike targets inside Lebanon, though he does not see a situation in which America would commit boots on the ground. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin have both asserted that the US would respond if the situation escalates and any US personnel or military are targeted.The US has the right to defend itself, said Mr Austin on Sunday, and it will not hesitate to "take the appropriate action".Mr Jones acknowledges the risk of the conflict widening, but he believes that US deterrence "does raise the costs of risks for Iran and its proxies". He says if Hezbollah in Lebanon were to engage in a major offensive operation from the north of Israel, "they would likely face a pretty serious response". He notes US forces in the region have  come under limited attacks from Iranian linked groups before. Nor is Israel asking for direct military support in its war with Hamas. Danny Orbach, professor of military history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, points out that Israel's military doctrine states it should be able to protect itself on its own. President Biden's visit to Israel this week showed that US support is conditional. He wants Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, and he does not want to see Israel occupy the Gaza strip indefinitely. He told CBS's 60 Minutes that doing so would be a "big mistake".  US support may also be time limited. Yaacov Katz, a military analyst and a columnist with the Jerusalem Post, believes that America's support for Israel will come under pressure as soon as its military operation begins in Gaza and the civilian casualties mount. He believes support could soften within weeks.  "I don't see Israel getting more leeway from America or the world for a ground offensive that lasts much longer," he says.The US clearly hopes that its military support for Israel and its own bolstered military presence in the region will be enough to prevent the conflict widening. There are few examples of the US directly intervening on behalf of Israel. The US sending Patriot batteries to defend Israel from Iraqi Scud missiles attacks, ahead of its own invasion in the 1991 Gulf war, is a rare exception. In fact, the US has more often used its military leverage over Israel as a restraining hand. 	
23/10/2023 17:22:00	Humza Yousaf's family running out of water in Gaza - BBC News	Humza Yousaf's family are running out of water as they shelter from Israeli bombardment in Gaza, the first minister has said.His parents-in-law have been trapped in the territory for two weeks following deadly attacks by Hamas in Israel. The SNP said the experience was like "torture" for his relatives, who are from Dundee. He reiterated his call for the UK government to demand safe passage for civilians from Gaza.Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said he was working with Israel and Egypt to open the Rafah crossing into Egypt to help British nationals leave the area.Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband Maged - the parents of Mr Yousaf's wife Nadia - travelled to Gaza to see a sick relative.During a visit to the flood-hit town of Brechin in Angus, Mr Yousaf could be seen speaking on the phone, walking away from his advisers to take the call, which was later revealed to be from his mother-in-law."It's a nightmare situation," he told BBC Scotland News. "It's a nightmare for us but it's torture for them."They can't sleep and of course they worry about the house being bombarded."The first minister said the couple were down to six bottles of drinking water in a house where 100 people were sheltering, including a child of two months old.He urged the UK government to demand that the Rafah crossing be opened "to allow foreign nationals and other innocent men, women and children in Gaza, with nothing to do with Hamas, to be able to leave".On Saturday, 20 aid trucks crossed from Egypt for the first time in two weeks. Campaigners have described the supplies as a "drop in the ocean" of what is needed.Mr Yousaf said: "We're seeing trickles of aid coming through, nowhere near what needs to go in. "The border also has to be opened to let people out because there is far too many innocent men, women and children - not just my mother-in-law and father-in-law - many, many innocent men, women and children are suffering a great deal."Israel began retaliatory air strikes on Gaza after Hamas's military wing killed about 1,400 people in an attack on Israel.More than 5,000 Palestinians have been killed in the last two weeks in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.UN agencies warned that Gaza was in a "desperate" humanitarian crisis even before the recent hostilities and was already reliant on about 500 trucks a day delivering vital supplies.About 1.2 million people living in the territory - out of a population of 2.2 million - already relied on food aid from UN relief agency UNRWA before 7 October.On Saturday, a spokesperson for the Israeli military said it would "deepen" and "increase" the strikes, in order to allow Israel to "minimise the risks to our forces in the next stages of the war".Thousands of people took part in in pro-Palestinian protests across the UK on Sunday, including a demonstration in Glasgow.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the UK government will provide a further £20m of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza.RAF and Royal Navy assets will also be deployed to monitor the situation in Israel and Palestine, he said. 	
23/10/2023 17:15:00	DP World in Tanzania: The UAE firm taking over Africa's ports - BBC News	A multimillion-dollar deal signed between Emirati maritime giant DP World and Tanzania on Sunday looks set to further entrench the dominance of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in Africa's freight industry.Reports of the $250m (£205m) deal first emerged in July, sparking criticism by the opposition that it "violated Tanzania's constitution and endangers national sovereignty".Activists petitioned a court to halt the deal and were briefly detained for planning anti-government protests.The high court in Tanzania's south-western town of Mbeya dismissed the petition, paving the way for DP World to manage two-thirds of the Dar es Salaam port for the next 30 years.Transport Minister Makame Mbarawa - whose office did not respond to earlier requests for comment - said there would be no job losses and that Tanzania would retain 60% of earnings.DP World says it expects to triple revenue within a decade and speed up the clearance of vessels from the current average of 12 hours to 60 minutes.Chronic inefficiency, corruption allegations and competition in freight management by neighbouring Kenya are some of the underlying reasons why Tanzania President Samia Suluhu signed off on the agreement."People have a right to raise concerns because this is a democracy. And it is the government's job to act," she said during the signing in the administrative capital, Dodoma, downplaying public disquiet.The UAE is the fourth-largest investor in Africa, after China, Europe and the US. In the last decade, it has invested nearly $60bn in infrastructure and energy sectors across the continent. DP World - established in 1999 and owned by Emirati ruling families - has increased those inroads with port operations in Angola, Djibouti, Egypt, Morocco, Mozambique, Senegal and Somalia. In 2021, DP World pledged to invest $1bn in Africa over the next several years.These investments have at times sparked tensions, tested geopolitical relations and - more crucially - intensified competition for infrastructural development in Africa.Like China, Turkey and Russia, the UAE is increasingly becoming a political and economic counterweight to the West in Africa.Abu Dhabi's diplomatic presence has been boosted by humanitarian support and defence cooperation, particularly in the Horn of Africa. It brokered a peace deal between Eritrea and Ethiopia in 2018, and delivered thousands of tonnes of food aid to Somalia in 2022 amid warnings of a looming famine.These relationships have given DP World a near monopoly in the Red Sea region, just north of Tanzania. They have also allowed the UAE to consolidate defence interests in the Gulf of Aden as part of an almost decade-long military offensive in Yemen.As a result, the UAE - despite its size - has an edge over other Gulf nations as the Horn of Africa is a strategic route for crude oil exports.DP World's developments in Somalia's Bossaso port and Berbera in the self-declared republic of Somaliland amount to almost $1bn. The agreements caused a row with the Somali federal government, which considers Somaliland to be part of its territory and has often had a turbulent relationship with the semi-autonomous Puntland region, which includes Bossaso.But DP World appears to have shrugged off political pressure to continue operations in both regions. Its forays in Djibouti - a combination of military real estate and one of the busiest shipping routes in the world - could serve as a cautionary tale.Djibouti's attempts to seize the Doraleh Container Terminal, its biggest income generator and employer, from DP World triggered an expensive legal battle.In 2018, Djibouti handed the terminal over to Hong Kong-based China Merchants Port Holdings to protest against a decision by DP World to give neighbouring Ethiopia and Somaliland access to imports.But the maritime firm, which has a 50-year concession over the port from 2006, argued that the changeover violated its "exclusive access" to the region. The Hong Kong appeals court ordered Djibouti to pay DP World more than $600 million in damages, reasserting its tight grip.The lengthy lease in Dar es Salaam is not unusual.The Emirati firm's deals across the continent on the Atlantic coast have been characterised by similarly long-term agreements.In 2007, DP World edged out French interests in Senegal to win a $1.13bn contract to develop the Ndayane port near the capital, Dakar, which it will control for 25 years.The firm is set to earn more than $400m over a period of 20 years from a multi-purpose terminal concession agreement with Angola.Between these developments is the Democratic Republic of Congo's $1.2bn deep-sea port in Banana that will be completed by 2025.Part of the contention over DP World's presence in Tanzania is the perception that its operations are undermining local rights and management.DP World Group boss Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem said while in Dodoma that the Dar es Salaam port would become a "world-class facility".President Samia's predecessor, John Magufuli, had long shunned foreign investment and treated international partners with suspicion.But since taking over in 2021, Mrs Samia has sought various partnerships with the UAE as a means to "address challenges and grab opportunities as quickly as possible".DP World remains an anchor for the UAE to extend its geopolitical ambitions across Africa.	
23/10/2023 17:12:00	'Hamas said they wouldn’t shoot, then murdered my daughter’ - BBC News	Warning: This article contains details that some readers may find disturbingAs Tsachi Idan was driven away to Gaza, his hands were still covered with his daughter's blood.He wasn't allowed to wash them after cradling 18-year-old Maayan, who was murdered in front of her family by a Hamas gunman.Nor was he able to wipe them clean before he used his body to shelter his two youngest children, as the sound of explosions ripped through the air outside their home. And throughout the ordeal, Hamas rigged up a phone to broadcast the family's pain and terror to the world on Facebook Live. Gali Idan, Tsachi's wife, is now far away from their beloved Nahal Oz, one of the many southern Israeli communities attacked by Hamas on 7 October. She and her surviving children are being looked after in a different kibbutz, surrounded by care and comfort. But it isn't home. Home is the place the family had lived in since Maayan was four years old. It's the house where they'd grown and made memories together, and where her younger brother and sisters had been born. Maayan, the eldest child, was mature, and shy. "She was perfect," their neighbour told me. She had just passed her driving test, and had her first boyfriend. She loved to read, and asked for books for her birthday just four days before she was killed. As Gali says, now, she'll forever be 18. Sitting in a shaded spot underneath the citrus trees, Gali says she doesn't want to recount the pain of that day - it's too raw - but she's doing it for Tsachi."I want him back. Whole, and alive. I want him back now."On 7 October, the family woke to the sound of red alert alarms, warning of rocket fire from Gaza. They knew what to do. But that morning, something was different. "It was unusual and very intense," Gali tells me. "It was a barrage. Barrage after barrage. We couldn't even go out and breathe. We closed ourselves in the mamad, our sheltered room inside our home.""Tsachi and I looked at each other and said that something here isn't right. Something was horrifying. "We got messages on the internal system of the kibbutz that we were under attack, and that we needed to stay inside the mamad. At some point they told us to be quiet, that there was likely an infiltration of terrorists within the kibbutz," she continued."You need to understand that this is something that was never an option, ever. It was always the nightmare of nightmares, but there was always a solution from the state or the security forces to that situation. And suddenly, it was real. The nightmare was real."Gali describes how - at that moment - something exploded outside the house, shattering the glass windows. Then came the sound of footsteps and voices inside their home. A man shouted in accented English, "we don't shoot". But they did. "Tsachi held onto the door and didn't let them open it," Gali continues. "There's no lock on it and the kids are screaming and there's crazy chaos inside the room. It's dark, but then Maayan understood.""She saw that they were able to open the door just a bit. And so she jumped up and helped Tsachi to grab the door."Gali's tears start to fall, but she keeps on describing that moment."They're screaming 'we don't shoot', and then they shot. Tsachi yelled 'who's been hit, who's been hit?' And it was Maayan. She fell next to him, and then Hamas were able to open the door. There were screams, and they turned on the light.""Maayan was in a huge puddle of blood. I checked her and realised she'd been hit in the head, and she was critically wounded. They yelled to us to get out of the mamad. We just told the kids 'don't look', and I led them out.""A war is going on around my house, and they are inside."In their nightwear, Tsachi, Gali and their two youngest children Yael, 11, and Shachar, 9, sat on the floor as the sound of gunfire echoed around them. One of their captors picked up Gali's phone, asked for her password, and began filming the family on Facebook Live. The video is painful to watch. For more than 26 minutes, the family are seen crouching low as more rocket sirens sound and the Hamas attack continues. The children jump in fright at the volleys of fire, and sob in their parents' arms. All the while, Maayan's lifeless body is lying just metres away.  "To my fortune, my kids are brave in a way that cannot be described," says Gali. "They talked to the terrorists, I don't know how they could. They asked them why they are here, and why they shoot and why they kill. Maybe that's what saved us?""And Tsachi is broken. He saw his daughter die, he saw her getting shot in the head and die next to him. His daughter that had just celebrated her 18th birthday. The house is full of balloons, and congratulations, and… and blood."Eventually, Tsachi is told to get up. His hands are cuffed behind his back with a cable tie. The children scream at Hamas not to take their dad, not to kill him. And then he's driven away.Sharon, Gali's second eldest daughter who was away in Tel Aviv when the attack took place, comforts her mother as she speaks of her ordeal. The 15-year-old managed to speak to her father on the phone during the attack. "Sharon, we're in a mess, I will call you later. I love you," Tsachi said, and hung up. It was the last time they talked. Gali's last words to her husband are burned into her mind too. "When he left the house I told him "I love you, don't be a hero, be smart. Take care of yourself, and come back to me in one piece. That's it. And now I want him to return to me, in one piece, and well," says Gali."Tsachi has to be here and to mourn his daughter. I need to hug him."Israel has now identified more than 200 people who are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. Across Israel and around the world, families are devastated."I don't understand what their goal is," says Gali. "They want to show themselves as monsters? There you go. You are monsters. You are the worst nightmare that our children can have. You are terror. There's no way to define it. It's awful. I don't know how long this scar is going to last. But they must bring the civilians back. They must bring them all back."At another kibbutz, far from home, Maayan's coffin sits in a peaceful spot in front of rows of chairs. There aren't enough seats to hold the hundreds of mourners who arrive to remember her, holding wreaths and bunches of colourful flowers. Friends and family make speeches and share memories of a young woman who loved playing volleyball, and loved life. Gali speaks to the assembled crowd, remembering her daughter. When she isn't at the microphone, she's holding her surviving children tightly. Yael and Shachar, at just 11 and 9, have seen such horrors that their small faces crumple into tears again and again. Their sister is dead, and their father isn't here to comfort them. Tsachi's absence is felt everywhere. Gali says she wants the world to know his name. Any small thing that might help to get him released, she's ready to do. Many of the mourners wear T-shirts with his and Maayan's pictures on the front. The words "kidnapped father" and "murdered daughter" appear above their faces, family photos from a happier time. On the reverse is a simple and powerful message, "bring Tsachi back". In this unimaginable darkness, his family needs him. 	
23/10/2023 14:24:00	Mother of Blackpool family stuck in Gaza says nowhere is safe - BBC News	A mother-of-four waiting with her family to cross the border into Egypt from Gaza has said "nowhere is safe".Stephanie Abuaassi, originally from Blackpool, Lancashire, moved with her family to Gaza a year ago.She recalled how they were forced to flee their home at night after Israel launched retaliatory air strikes following Hamas's attack on 7 October. "We're lucky we had somewhere a bit safer [to move to] but still nowhere is safe," she said.Ms Abuaassi said she hoped her family could cross the Egyptian border at Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip later on Monday. She explained that she had moved from Blackpool with her husband, who has family in Gaza, in order to learn Arabic, which she says she still does not speak well.The Gaza Strip only has two other border crossings, both with Israel - Erez, a crossing for people in northern Gaza and Kerem Shalom, a solely commercial goods junction in southern Gaza. Both are now shut."We've experienced bombing and planes flying over us, buildings destroyed, all sorts of horrible things," she said. "I hope we get through to Egypt today."Ms Abuaassi said her family had temporarily moved into a relative's flat in Khan Younis for a week, where 43 people were staying. She hopes that the family's British passports will help them get across the border."I feel very sorry for the people of Gaza who are not able to leave and are stuck here," she said. "I just hope [there is help for]  these people who have been left behind."People now don't have anywhere to live and are homeless. I just hope these people get help."One of her children recalled how the family had to run from their home in the middle of the night. "Many buildings near us had been bombed," he said, adding they later found refuge in a hospital. "In the hospital when I was there, I saw people crying, people's hands broken, women crying."I saw someone in shock - they were shaking - from the bombs."Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

23/10/2023 13:29:00	Israel-Gaza war: Israel ambassador's comments about Irish president 'unhelpful' - BBC News	Israel's ambassador to Ireland has been criticised for comments about the Irish president.On Sunday, Dana Erlich accused President Michael D Higgins of making misinformed comments on the Israel-Gaza war.Ms Erlich also questioned Ireland's neutrality, telling the Sunday Independent there was "a strong feeling in Israel that there is an unconscious bias against Israel in Ireland".Speaking to reporters in Italy last week, Mr Higgins accused Israel of breaking international law."To announce in advance that you will break international law and to do so on an innocent population, it reduces all the code that was there from second world war on protection of civilians and it reduces it to tatters," Mr Higgins said.Irish Enterprise Minister Simon Coveney told RTÉ that the "pointed" comments by Ms Erlich were not helpful."I think Michael D Higgins has reflected the view of many in Ireland," the former foreign affairs minister added.Responding to the president's comments, Ms Erlich told the Sunday Independent that she was "concerned about spreading misinformation"., external"Israel is abiding by international law," she added.Meanwhile, a senior Israeli diplomat has accused the Republic of Ireland of funding the Palestinian militant group Hamas.Writing on social media, Adi Ophir Moaz of the Israeli embassy in Dublin, claimed Ireland funded "tunnels of terror" under Gaza.She has since deleted the post on X, formerly Twitter."Millions of euros are being transferred to Gaza and being used by Hamas for terror purposes," a spokesperson for the embassy told BBC News NI.A spokesperson for Mr Higgins told RTÉ that the president's comments "related to the breach of international law that attacking civilians as collective punishment represents"."The president has condemned all of the outrages and killings that have taken place and said that in responding to all of this it is important that international law is observed," they said.The spokesperson added that Mr Higgins has "expressed his revulsion at the killing of civilians by Hamas, called for the immediate release of all hostages taken and has been clear that we must be absolutely unequivocal about anti-Semitic expression".Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, and about 200 people taken hostage, when Hamas attacked communities near the border with Gaza, shooting civilians dead in their homes, in the streets and at a music festival. Among the dead was 22-year-old Irish-Israeli woman Kim Damti who was killed at the Supernova music festival in Re'im.Palestinian health officials say more than 5,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes, and a ground offensive is expected.Read more: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?	
22/10/2023 19:22:00	Pro-Israel protest in London calls for return of hostages - BBC News	A pro-Israel demonstration has been taking place as part of calls for the safe return of hostages from Gaza. Protesters in London's Trafalgar Square have held up photos of those missing, with their names being read out from the steps of the National Gallery. Security in the square was high with a significant police presence, a BBC reporter at the scene said.Many in the crowd chanted "bring them home" and clutching signs that say "release the hostages".It comes a day after pro-Palestine protests took place in cities across the UK.The Israel flag has been visible across the event and a minute's silence, as well a group prayer, was following speeches from MPs and leaders of the Jewish community. The president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Marie van der Zyl, who has attended, said: "The world has got to see that these hostages were cruelly and barbarically taken, they have to be released."The world should put pressure on those who can have any influence to release these innocent hostages who have suffered unbearable trauma and torment, let the hostage comes home."Communities Secretary Michael Gove urged Israel to "stand strong", adding "Britain stands with Israel".Addressing demonstrators, he said: "There are no words to describe the suffering of families who have seen their relatives butchered in front of them and relatives who live in hope that those who were living peacefully in their homes just two weeks ago and are now in a Hamas dungeon should be freed."Earlier, grieving families gathered in Trafalgar Square to highlight the children kidnapped by Hamas.Organised by four London mothers, the flash installation featured a buggy to represent each of the children missing.Hamas - a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK, US and European Union - launched a deadly attack against Israeli civilians on 7 October.More than 1,400 people were killed when gunmen breached security at the Gaza barrier and raided communities in southern Israel, with survivors reporting widespread atrocities including torture and bodies being burnt. More than 200 people were taken to Gaza as hostages.Officials in Hamas-controlled Gaza say more than 4,600 people have been killed over the last two weeks after Israel began retaliatory air strikes.Protester Nivi, who joined those at the installation, said her children were at a summer camp in Israel with one of the boys who is believed to be one of the hostages.She said: "They were showing pictures of the hostages and my eight-year-old said, 'Mummy, this is Ohad. Ohad was with me at camp'. "And he asked me, 'Why is his picture there? And I had to tell him, 'Well he's one of the kids that the bad people took away', it's heartbreaking".Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

22/10/2023 18:01:00	Hamas hostages: Families 'worried sick' for relatives held in Gaza - BBC News	A British-Israeli woman has told the BBC she is "worried sick" for the health of her diabetic mother and brother who are believed to among the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.  Ayelet Svatitzky's mother Channah Peri, 79, and brother Nadav Popplewell, 51, were taken by Hamas when their kibbutz in southern Israel was attacked on 7 October.  Her other brother Roi, 54, was killed. She called on the UK government to do "everything in its power" to secure their release. On the day of the attack, Ms Svatitzky said she received two pictures, sent by the attackers from her mother's phone, showing the pair sitting in her mother's living room. Underneath was written "Hamas" in English. Hours later, a third picture was posted on her mother's Facebook showing them with an armed Hamas gunman in the corner.  "That was the last I heard of them," Ms Svatitzky said. "My mom is 79, she has diabetes. She uses insulin daily. My brother Nadav is also diabetic. So he takes pills for that condition, so the medication issue is really troubling and worrying." Ms Svatitzky says she does not know how long she can survive without insulin, or her brother without medication. "We haven't been able to get the Red Cross over to provide medication and provide us with any kind of and updates, proof of life, or what state they're in." Ms Svatitzky said has been unable to grieve for her brother, who was found shot dead at the back of his home after the attack at Kibbutz Nirim. "His body hasn't been officially identified. I haven't buried him yet. I've lost my brother but I have to do everything in my power to bring my mom and Nadav home. "I want the British government to do everything in their power... to bring those people home." She added: "Taking the elderly people and young children, it's a war crime as far as I'm concerned. These are innocent people, they haven't harmed anyone." Ms Svatitzky and her brothers are all British citizens. The family originally came from Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said on Sunday the UK was "working intensively with all our partners across the region to secure the release of British nationals" held hostage by Hamas. Ofri Bibas Levy's said it was her "worst nightmare" when she discovered her family members had been taken hostage from their home in Nir Oz. She has not heard from her brother, Yarden, 34, his wife, Shiri, and their two children, four-year-old Ariel, and nine-month-old Kfir. "I heard what the Hamas was doing that day. They were torturing people, burning them alive, killing babies, raping women and I couldn't imagine what they were going through. "I don't know what happened inside the house, what the little babies saw in their house." She does not know if the family are still together and she is worried if the children's basic needs are being met. "What are they eating? Are they keeping warm? How are they spending their days? Are they locked somewhere? Do they have sunlight? Are they in a dark place? "Did they see any horrible things that the child shouldn't see?" She said nine-month-old Kfir had just started crawling and eating formula food before they were taken hostage. For two weeks her family have asked the international community for support but now "I just want action", she said. She said she wanted the government to put "pressure for any kind of humanitarian organisation to go inside and check on them and to release them". "They are civilians and are not supposed to be there. The longer they are there the harder it's going to be to recover them and the less chance they're going to come out alive." Asked if she still has hope, she said: "I have to." David Barr is a British-Israeli man living on a kibbutz that came under attack. His sister-in-law Naomi was killed by Hamas while out jogging. "My message to the British government is clear: What happened here has no place in this world," he said. "The hostages have to be brought home first."The British government has to do everything as a moral mission, to bring home our elderly parents, children, babies to bring them all home." 	
22/10/2023 16:36:00	Iran warns Israel to stop war in Gaza or region will 'go out of control' - BBC News	Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has warned Israel that the Middle East could spiral out of control if it does not stop strikes on Gaza.He said the US was also "to blame" for providing military support to Israel.Hours later, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu warned troops his people were in a battle for their lives and said the war against Hamas was "do or die".Iran supports both Hamas, which attacked Israel two weeks ago killing 1,400 people, and Lebanon's Hezbollah.More than 4,600 Palestinians have been killed in the last two weeks in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and Israel announced on Saturday that it was intensifying air strikes."I warn the US and its proxy Israel that if they do not immediately stop the crime against humanity and genocide in Gaza, anything is possible at any moment and the region will go out of control," Mr Amir-Abdollahian said at a news conference in Tehran.He said that the results could be "severe, bitter" and "have far-reaching repercussions", both regionally and for those advocating for war.The foreign minister added that US military support for Israel was evidence that the ongoing conflict in Gaza was "a proxy war carried out by Israel on behalf of the United States".Top US officials are also warning the conflict could spread.US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin warned of the prospect of "significant escalation of attacks" on US troops or citizens."If any group or any country is looking to widen this conflict and take advantage of this very unfortunate situation... our advice is: don't," he said on the ABC network's This Week programme.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also mentioned a "likelihood of escalation" from Iranian proxies, such as Hezbollah or Hamas, and said the US was "taking every measure to make sure we can defend" Israelis and US citizens.Several Iraqi bases used by US-led coalition troops have been targeted in drone and rocket attacks in recent days.Also on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu paid a visit to troops in northern Israel near the border with Lebanon, which has seen exchanges of fire with Hezbollah since the early days of the conflict. "We're in a battle for our lives. A battle for our home, this is not an exaggeration, this is the war. It's do or die - they need to die," he said.He warned Hezbollah not to enter the war."[Hezbollah] will be making the biggest mistake of their lives. And we will hit them with an unimaginable force. It will mean devastation for them and the state of Lebanon," he said.For its part, Hezbollah has declared that it is "fully ready to fight against Israel".At least 27 people have been reported killed in southern Lebanon during exchanges of fire between Israel and Hamas. At least five Israeli soldiers and one civilian have been killed in Israel, according to Israeli military reports.Israel has ordered dozens of northern communities to evacuate, adding 14 more on Sunday.And in neighbouring Syria - where Iran has a military presence - Israeli missiles hit Damascus and Aleppo international airports early on Sunday, killing at least two workers, according to Syrian state media.Both airports have been taken out of use given the damage to their runways.	
22/10/2023 14:41:00	Iran says girl who collapsed on Tehran metro is ‘brain dead’ - BBC News	A teenage Iranian girl who fell into a coma after an alleged altercation with morality police is now considered to be "brain dead", state media say.Armita Geravand, 16, collapsed after boarding a Tehran metro train on 1 October.Activists accused morality police of assaulting her for not wearing a hijab, but authorities insisted she fainted.There was no immediate confirmation of Armita's condition from her parents or activists.The teenager is being treated at Tehran's Fajr hospital under tight security.Many Iranians have drawn parallels with the case of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who died in custody in September 2022 after being detained by morality police in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab "improperly".Witnesses said she was beaten by officers, but authorities attributed her death to pre-existing medical conditions.Anti-government protests, which are still taking place, erupted across the country when Amini died after three days in a coma. Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands detained in a violent crackdown by security forces.CCTV footage released by Iranian authorities shows Armita Geravand, with her hair uncovered, boarding a train at Tehran's Shohada station with two other girls. Moments later, one of the girls backs out of the train and bends down.She and several other passengers are then seen carrying an unconscious Armita by her arms and legs before laying her down on the platform.No footage from inside the train or the entrance to the station was released.Human rights group Hengaw, which focuses on Iran's Kurdish ethnic minority, alleged that Armita was "physically attacked by authorities... for what they perceived as non-compliance with the compulsory 'hijab'". "As a result," it added, "she sustained severe injuries."However, the managing director of the Tehran metro denied that there was "any verbal or physical conflict" between Armita and "passengers or metro executives".Hengaw later posted on social media what it said was a photo of Armita unconscious in hospital. The picture showed a girl lying on her back in a bed with a bandaged head and attached to what appeared to be a breathing tube.On Sunday, state broadcaster IRINN reported that "follow-ups on the latest health condition of Armita Geravand indicate that her health condition as brain dead seems certain despite the efforts of the medical staff".Eight days ago, Hengaw had said the teenager remained in a coma and that her condition showed no signs of improvement. In a separate development on Sunday, a Revolutionary Court handed lengthy prison terms to two female journalists who reported on Mahsa Amini's death last year. Niloufar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammadi were sentenced to seven years and six years in prison respectively after being convicted of "collaborating with the hostile American government" and "colluding against national security", state news agency Irna said.  The women denied the charges and insisted that they were just doing their jobs.Ms Hamedi, a journalist with the Sharq newspaper, photographed Mahsa Amini's father and grandmother hugging each other in hospital after learning of her death. She posted it on Twitter with the caption: "The black dress of mourning has become our national flag."Ms Mohammadi, a reporter with the Hammihan newspaper, published a story about Ms Amini's funeral in her hometown of Saqqez. She described how hundreds of mourners cried out "Woman, life, freedom", which became one of the main slogans of the protests.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.	
22/10/2023 11:22:00	Israel-Hamas war: 'Hide religion,' Welsh Jewish student told - BBC News	A Jewish university student says they have been told not to show outright signs of their religion amid the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The 20-year-old from Cardiff University, who wishes to remain anonymous, said she felt scared about becoming a target of abuse. Meanwhile, a Welsh-Palestinian woman said she felt "dehumanised" by language used. Thousands of people have died since the start of the conflict. Palestinian officials say more than 4,300 people have been killed in Gaza since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,400 and taking an estimated 200 hostages. The student said a lot of people had stopped wearing their kippahs out as they did not want to become targets.She said a friend had been "terrified to go back to campus" over fears of how people would react. During a recent conference call, the Union of Jewish Students advised those who were worried about becoming targets to hide signs of their Jewish faith.Cardiff University said there was support available and it had a zero-tolerance approach to racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. Meanwhile, Alaa Khundakji, 36, a Welsh-Palestinian from Cardiff whose family were displaced to south Gaza due to bombing, said the atmosphere in the UK had made things worse."There is such great fear and anger and disappointment in the way it's portrayed, in the way as a community we're dehumanised," she said. She added that Palestinian families had told her of children coming home from school "distressed." She said Palestinian people in the UK were feeling "marginalised and alienated".Israeli-born Moran and Tova, from Cardiff, said Israel was meant to be "a safe haven" for Jewish people and the community had felt let down by the Welsh government since Hamas's attack. She said: "We had a meeting here, we had a representative of the British government but not Wales."Both women said they felt unsafe and claimed a friend had been verbally abused while placing an Israeli flag on the steps of the Senedd. They said another friend had tried to join but turned back upon seeing a pro-Palestine march in Cardiff. Moran said: "We are keeping a low profile at the moment."She said she would not allow Hamas to "let us live in fear, they will not win and we will walk with our heads up and proud".Tova added: "We don't normally want to be anonymous, we are proud Israelis, and it's painful."Three of Wales' police forces said they had not seen a notable increase in reported hate crime, but Supt Tim Morgan of South Wales Police said the service was "actively reaching out" to offer support.The Muslim Council of Wales' secretary general Dr Abdul-Azim Ahmed said it was reassuring that Welsh police had not seen a rise in hate crime, but many Muslims were "hurting" and "afraid.""People are concerned about the impact of campaigning for Palestine. They're concerned as well about the reception and sentiment others hold. "It's such a polarised time, especially some of the rhetoric coming from authorities."The Welsh government said: "The first minister has strongly condemned the appalling attacks carried out by Hamas and the horrific escalation in violence against Israel.""The minister for social justice has reached out to faith leaders in Wales to express her shock and condolences and is in touch with Faith Communities Forum to arrange a meeting with representatives from the Jewish community as soon as possible."When asked about Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's language around Palestinians, the UK government pointed to his statement in the Commons earlier this week when he said: "We mourn the loss of every innocent life, of the civilians of every faith and every nationality who have been killed, so let us say it plainly: we stand with British Muslim communities, too."He said the UK government was providing an extra £10m of aid to Palestinians, saying Palestinian people were "victims of Hamas too". 	
22/10/2023 09:36:00	Israel carries out air strike on West Bank city Jenin - BBC News	Israel carried out an air strike in Jenin in the northern occupied West Bank on Sunday, saying Hamas was using a mosque as a "terrorist compound".Palestinian Authority (PA) officials said two people died when the Al-Ansar mosque was hit.Although the Israeli military regularly raids targets in the West Bank, it rarely uses air strikes there like it does against Hamas-controlled Gaza.Pictures from the scene showed rubble and significant damage to the building.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said those killed were from the Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad groups and were organising an "imminent terror attack".It said the compound they were using was under the mosque and had been in use since July. It released images of what it said were entrances to the compound, alongside images of weapons, computers and security measures pictured at the site.The IDF did not confirm whether a plane, helicopter or drone had been used in the Jenin strike on Sunday, but Israeli media reported that it was a fighter jet.The reports said that, if confirmed, it would be only the second time in about two decades that a fighter jet had hit a target in the West Bank.The Palestinian Authority's health ministry says two other Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank overnight. It brings the total number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank since 7 October to 89.The PA governs parts of the West Bank that are not under full Israeli control. President Mahmoud Abbas is the leader of the PA and the Fatah political party.The Gaza Strip is run by Fatah's rival Hamas, which carried out deadly attacks on Israeli military posts and kibbutzim near Gaza on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 200 hostages into Gaza.Israel has been carrying out an intensive air bombardment of Gaza ahead of an expected ground offensive there and has vowed to destroy Hamas as an organisation.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 55 more Palestinians in Gaza were killed in Israeli air strikes overnight and that more than 4,300 have been killed in total since 7 October, more than half of them women and children.	
22/10/2023 07:15:00	Starmer condoned war crimes - ex Labour MP Lynne Jones - BBC News	An ex-Labour MP who quit the party over comments made by Sir Keir Starmer about the Israel-Gaza conflict has accused him of condoning war crimes.Responding to a question about Israel's right to cut off power and water to Gaza, Sir Keir said he thought "Israel does have that right".He has since clarified his comment, but ex Birmingham Selly Oak MP Lynne Jones said: "It was... the end of my tether."Some Walsall Labour councillors have also written a letter of complaint.Speaking on LBC Radio, Sir Keir was asked whether Israel was right to respond to the attacks by Hamas with a siege of Gaza, cutting off water and power."I think that Israel does have that right, it is an ongoing situation, obviously everything should be done within international law," he said.Sir Keir later clarified those comments to explain he was speaking about Israel's right to defend itself, not to cut off power and water, and that Israel should respond within international law.But not before nine Labour councillors on Walsall Council wrote an open letter, calling on him to "do the honourable thing by apologising and retracting his comments".They warned if he did not, he would "continue to cause irreparable disillusionment and apathy towards Labour amongst the voting Muslim community in Walsall and across the country". Labour councillors elsewhere in the country have quit the party over their leader's comments.Ms Jones, who represented Selly Oak until 2010 and was formerly the chair of the Socialist Campaign Group, told the BBC's Politics Midlands programme: "He was condoning war crimes on the part of the Israeli government.  "He's a human rights lawyer and he knows that collective punishment is not allowed under international law."Ms Jones said she had left the party after being a member for 50 years.Speaking on the same programme, Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Perry Barr, in Birmingham, said Sir Keir had made "very clear" what he meant by the comments over the past few days."I think sometimes in a live interview you don't quite exactly make the distinction, he's cleared that up," Mr Mahmood said. "I think sometimes people have other grievances in the party too and when these sort of occasions arise they try to use those in order to move forward."Speaking on the programme, Harriett Baldwin, Conservative MP for West Worcestershire, said: "There are a lot of very strong views on all sorts of different things."Words are used here without, I think, due care or due understanding of the situation."She added: "I think we need to just really focus not on the emotions but on the facts; and what we all want to see is the peaceful coexistence of a two-state solution."Mr Mahmood also said military action would not resolve the issue and talks were needed, possibly with the support of UN peacekeepers in Gaza.Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

24/10/2023 02:00:00	Israel confirms two more hostages released from Gaza - BBC News		
21/10/2023 23:06:00	Israel-Gaza war: UN agencies call for Gaza ceasefire as aid arrives - BBC News	A group of UN agencies have called for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza as conditions worsen in the territory.The World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) were among five agencies who described the situation in Gaza as "catastrophic" in a joint statement. The UN's plea for a de-escalation of the conflict comes as Israel warns of intensified strikes on Gaza. On Saturday, 20 aid trucks crossed from Egypt for the first time in two weeks.But campaigners said the aid that flowed through the Rafah crossing represented a "drop in the ocean" of what was needed.Prior to the war, about 500 aid trucks a day were entering Gaza, said a spokesman from ActionAid Palestine. A significant proportion of those living in the territory - some 1.2 million people - already relied on aid before the recent conflict erupted, according to the UN.Israel began retaliatory air strikes on Gaza after an unprecedented assault on 7 October by Hamas's military wing on Israel. About 1,400 people were killed in that attack - many of whom were in their homes near Gaza or at a music festival in southern Israel.More than 4,300 Palestinians have been killed in the last two weeks in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Israel is widely expected to launch a ground offensive into the Gaza Strip, but the timing remains unknown. In the meantime, it has put Gaza under siege, cutting off essential supplies.Saturday's aid delivery included medicines, food, water and coffins, but not fuel.The UN agencies highlighted that children, pregnant women and the elderly were the most vulnerable - and that nearly half of the population of the Gaza Strip were children. The UN's Development Programme (UNDP), its Population Fund (UNFPA) and its International Children's Emergency Fund (Unicef) put forward the statement alongside the WFP and the WHO.As well as calling for a ceasefire, they said "immediate, unrestricted humanitarian access throughout Gaza" was necessary to "allow humanitarian actors to reach civilians in need". They added that "more than 1.6 million people in Gaza are in critical need of humanitarian aid". The Gaza Strip is a densely-populated enclave bounded by the Mediterranean Sea on one side and fenced off from Israel and Egypt. Home to 2.2 million people, the region is 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide."Gaza was a desperate humanitarian situation before the most recent hostilities," the UN agencies said. "It is now catastrophic".Also on Saturday, leaders of the Arab world rejected the forced displacement of Palestinians into the Sinai peninsula.Speaking at a summit in Cairo, Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said the only solution was an independent state for Palestinians.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Israel and Egypt to allow the Rafah crossing from Egypt to remain open to allow sustained supply of aid.	
21/10/2023 19:52:00	Cairo Summit: Arab leaders reject forced displacement of Palestinians - BBC News	Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has said he rejects the forced displacement of Palestinians into the Sinai peninsula as the first aid convoy entered Gaza after two weeks of war.Speaking at a summit in Cairo, Mr Sisi said the only solution was an independent state for Palestinians.The summit began as 20 trucks carrying aid crossed the Rafah border.However humanitarian organisations have warned it will not be enough to address the need.About 500 trucks a day had been entering Gaza before the war started. Some 1.2 million people living in the territory already relied on food aid, the UN says.The UN will be responsible for distributing the aid, with much of it likely to be sent to UN schools where thousands have been sheltering and hospitals.One of the trucks was loaded with coffins, a BBC reporter watching the trucks enter Gaza reports.Afterwards US President Joe Biden expressed his "deep personal appreciation" to Egypt, Israel and the UN for allowing the aid to get through."We will continue to work with all parties to keep the Rafah crossing in operation to enable the continued movement of aid that is imperative to the welfare of the people of Gaza," his statement said.Israel's military said the aid was for southern Gaza only and repeated calls for residents in the northern Gaza Strip to leave their homes.They should move south of Wadi Gaza in the centre of the territory, it said.It has vowed to wipe the Hamas "off the face of the earth".However in his speech at the Cairo-hosted "Summit for Peace", Mr Sisi said his country would not allow Palestinians to be displaced across the Rafah crossing into Egypt.His comments were backed by Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud.Mahmoud Abbas, who is head of the Palestinian Authority which has control over areas of the occupied West Bank but not the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, also said Palestinians could not be forced to leave."We will never accept relocation, we will remain on our land whatever the challenges," he said.The summit broke up without a joint statement.No Israeli or senior US officials were present, and differences between Arab and European countries were stark.According to Arab diplomats quoted by AFP on condition of anonymity, European delegates demanded "a clear condemnation placing responsibility for the escalation on Hamas" but Arab leaders refused.At the end, Egypt released a statement approved by Arab delegations, criticising world leaders for seeking to "manage the conflict and not end it permanently". Egypt and other Arab states have previously said an influx of Palestinian refugees fleeing the war would be unacceptable because it would amount to the expulsion of Palestinians from their land.Meanwhile King Abdullah of Jordan denounced what he called "global silence about Israel's attacks on Gaza"."The message the Arab world is hearing is that Palestinian lives matter less than Israeli ones," he said.UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told the leaders in the summit that he had spoken to the Israeli government about its duty to respect international law and to preserve civilian lives in Gaza."Despite the incredibly difficult circumstances, I have called for discipline and professionalism and restraint from the Israeli military," he added.Mr Cleverly added that the international community needed to work to prevent the situation in Gaza provoking a regional conflict.During his address to the summit, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for a "humanitarian ceasefire" in the war, demanding global "action to end this godawful nightmare".The Palestinians need "a continuous delivery of aid to Gaza at the scale that is needed", he said.Israel began retaliatory air strikes on Gaza after an attack by Hamas's military wing on Israel on 7 October killed 1,400 people, many in their homes in kibbutzes near Gaza and at a music festival that was happening nearby.Israel says more than 300 soldiers were also killed in the attack and Hamas took more than 200 hostages into Gaza.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says that more than 4,300 people have been killed in Israeli air strikes, more than half of them women and children.	
21/10/2023 17:40:00	Rushdi Abualouf: My daughters beg for Gaza City return - but our old lives are over - BBC News	Two days ago, my wife and children nearly died.They were on the ground floor of a four-storey building in Khan Younis, Gaza, near a hospital where I'm sleeping in a tent.They were about to leave for the day to meet me when an Israeli drone attack punched through the top floor.My nine-year-old twin daughters ran out into the street screaming, separated from their mother, who was struck in the head by a piece of rubble.My wife's injuries were, thankfully, minor. But my daughters were traumatised. That night, they stayed up crying, and I had to call up a doctor to ask them what we could do to help them sleep. My family now spends their nights just a few doors down from the building that was struck, not knowing if they're safe as they close their eyes.Me, my wife, our daughters and our 18-year-old son have been displaced four times in the two weeks since this war erupted, moving from place to place to heed Israeli warnings of air strikes, our mattresses strapped to the roof of our car. My daughters have had to leave behind everything they love in Gaza City and head south - their school, their friends, their horse riding club, their favourite pizza shop.Death and life have become equal in Gaza. Bombardment from above is constant. It's all too much for many adults, let alone a child: no nine-year-old on Earth should have to go through this.My daughters keep trying to hold on to my leg, to hug me, to do anything to feel safe. It will take them a long time to recover, and they will need a lot of support.Both of them are constantly asking to go back to Gaza City, to relative normality.Before this latest escalation, we lived a better life than 99% of Palestinians. Electricity here is limited, most of the water was unclean, and getting out - even for a short vacation - is difficult. There are 40-year-olds who have never left this tiny strip of land.But we have been lucky enough to be able to take holidays abroad sometimes for a month or more at a time. This summer we toured Istanbul, Cyprus, Egypt, and Jordan - my children nearly cried when I told them we had to go back to Gaza.In Gaza City, we had a large flat 400 metres from the beach. My wife and I often walked together on the sand in the morning.My son went to university and my daughters went to a good school - they go swimming at a club and ride horses. They have their own tablet where they can watch YouTube. I bring them sweets home from work and play with them in the evening - sometimes, they fall asleep in my bed and I carry them to their room in the dark.Now, the neighbourhood where my children grew up in deserted and flattened by bombs. Most nights, I visit a friend's house, playing cards and drinking coffee. As a family, we try to go to a nice restaurant once a week, normally the pizza shop or a nearby restaurant that cooks meat in a special pot. We all love it there. Now, that pizza shop is rubble. Despite all the difficulties, we try to enjoy ourselves. Gaza is not always a war zone and when there is any chance for joy, we take it. We stick together, and it's that connection - the love of my wife, my daughters, and my son - that keeps me strong, whether the situation is good or bad.Even today in the middle of this war, we still try to find moments of happiness whenever we can. My children visit me when I'm working - they put on my flak jacket, my helmet, and we laugh together. They pick up the microphone and pretend they're correspondents.But life for them will never be the same. My daughters keep asking about the places they remember from before, about the market we used to shop in. They are begging to go back. They don't understand that we cannot return.Every day, doctors and others who remain in the north tell me about another building destroyed - another road cratered, another petrol station blown up.After their building was struck, I made a promise to my family that I will get them out of Gaza when this is all over, away to a safe place. They have sacrificed enough.Just before we fled Gaza City to head south with hundreds of thousands of other people, I walked around our flat, cherishing all the memories my family and I made there.I turned to my wife and said: "Have a look at this lovely home. We might not ever come back."Today, I'm sleeping in a tent, thinking of my normal bed, of drinking coffee by the sea. These are now just dreams.	
21/10/2023 15:16:00	Israeli Arabs arrested over Gaza social media posts - BBC News	Dozens of Arab citizens of Israel have been arrested in connection with social media posts about the war in Gaza. Among them is a well-known singer and influencer from Nazareth, Dalal Abu Amneh, who was held in police custody for two days before being released on Wednesday on bail. She's now under house arrest until Monday. According to her lawyer, Abeer Baker, she was accused of "disruptive behaviour" by police officers, who said her posts could incite violence among her followers. The post that attracted police attention was an image of the Palestinian flag with the Arabic motto: "There is no victor but God."Ms Baker says the singer, who is well known across the Arab world for her songs about Palestinian heritage, was expressing a religious sentiment. Israeli authorities interpreted the singer's post as a call to arms for Palestinians.Since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, police in Israel have adopted what they call a "zero tolerance policy" towards social media activity deemed to express support for Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and designated as a terrorist group by Israel, as well as the US, UK, and many other countries.Ms Abu Amneh is one of dozens of Arab citizens of Israel arrested in connection with social media posts about the war. Many others have been suspended or sacked from their jobs or face disciplinary action from their universities.Israeli Arabs - many of whom prefer to be called Palestinian citizens of Israel - make up a fifth of the country's population.Since Hamas's attack, police say they have investigated and detained more than 100 people for their social media activity. Sixty-three have been arrested and questioned in Jerusalem alone. "Anyone inciting against the State of Israel, its government symbols, elected officials, military personnel and police, should be aware that the Israel Police will respond firmly and without leniency," said Israel's Police Commissioner, Yaakov Shabtai, at a meeting with senior leaders this week.Adalah, the Legal Centre for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, believes the number of detained is higher as more arrests have been made recently.By comparison, during the Israel-Gaza conflict in May 2021, only 16 people - 15 of whom were Arab - were charged with inciting violence, according to a report released by Adalah.Human rights activists worry this spike in detentions is due to the police adopting a wider interpretation of what constitutes incitement to violence.In the Bedouin city of Rahat, for example, police have detained a former mayoral candidate, Dr Amer al-Huzail, who shared on social media a map of the Gaza Strip with an analysis of possible scenarios for an expected ground operation by Israeli forces. This has led him to be accused of aiding the enemy in a time of war.But even when no criminal charges are filed, some people in Israel are still facing heavy consequences for their social media activity.Lawyers working for Adalah say they have received more than 40 cases of Israeli Arab workers suspended or fired from their workplaces overnight. "People are getting their livelihood threatened sometimes just for liking a post," says Salam Irsheid, a lawyer at the organisation. "We even have a case of a worker who is at risk of being fired for liking a news report on the situation in Gaza on social media."Arab students in Israel are also facing disciplinary actions from their universities. Last week, Ariel Porat, the president of Tel Aviv University, said that a few students had been flagged for expressing "support for the atrocities of Hamas"."We will be very strict with this handful of students," he wrote in a statement on the university's website, "and when we feel the offence is criminal in nature, we shall report them to the police. We will act swiftly, as required in this sensitive situation, but will not deny any student the right to a fair investigation."Lawyers from Adalah say they have received complaints from 83 students who have been suspended from schools across the country and, in some cases, told to leave their accommodation at short notice."None of the cases are about actions, demonstrations or participating in illegal things. They're all about posts on social media," says Dr Hassan Jabareen, the general director of Adalah."More than 90% of the posts are clearly against the war, against Israel's actions in Gaza, supporting the victims of war in Gaza," he adds. "Ten percent of the posts fall in a vague area that may be interpreted as indirectly supporting the acts of Hamas against civilians. "In normal times, they wouldn't be interpreted like that, but these days Israel tends to give the harshest interpretation to these posts."Public outrage at the attack by Hamas, which killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, in areas near the Gaza Strip, has also led to anger at Jewish Israeli voices calling for de-escalation.Last Sunday, a prominent left-wing ultra-Orthodox Jewish journalist, Israel Frey, had to be escorted by police away from his home in Tel Aviv for his own protection.Protesters had gathered outside the building and shot flares at his apartment after he posted on social media a video where he was praying for civilians in Gaza.And on Wednesday, Ofer Cassif, a Jewish lawmaker for the Arab-led Hadash-Taal alliance, was suspended from the Israeli parliament for 45 days after he strongly condemned the bombing of Gaza. In one of his most recent posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, he criticised the police who, he said, hadn't intervened promptly in Mr Frey's defence. "Armed police forces are sent to arrest anyone who shows a trace of empathy for the massacres in Gaza," he wrote. "But the police have no desire to protect a left-wing journalist whose life is in danger." 	
21/10/2023 13:56:00	Gaza neighbourhood flattened and hospital told to evacuate - BBC News	Continuing Israeli air strikes on Gaza have destroyed most of a neighbourhood and officials from the Hamas-run health ministry say the overall death toll has risen to more than 4,300 people.More than half of those killed are women and children, the ministry says.About 1.4 million Gazans have been displaced with more than half a million people in 147 UN shelters, the UN says.On Saturday the first aid trucks entered Gaza. Israel's military said the aid was for southern Gaza only.It has told all residents in the northern Gaza Strip to leave and move south of Wadi Gaza in the centre of the territory.However Israeli air strikes have also continued in southern Gaza and some people have refused to leave their homes, saying nowhere is safe.Israel cut off supplies of fuel, electricity and water to Gaza after Hamas's military wing broke through the border into Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 200 hostages into Gaza.The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said "intensive bombardments" were continuing on Gaza, as were Palestinian armed groups' "indiscriminate rocket firing towards Israeli population centres".UN officials describe the situation in Gaza as catastrophic. Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said humanitarian conditions in Gaza were "under control".The latest Israeli airstrikes destroyed the al-Zahraa neighbourhood in central Gaza, with more than two dozen blocks of flats razed to the ground overnight into Friday.Images and footage posted on social media showed plumes of smoke rising above the neighbourhood and lines of flattened buildings along rubble-lined streets.Residents told the BBC that they had not expected the bombing as the area had been relatively calm. They said they were told to evacuate on Thursday evening at around 20:30 to 21:00 local time (17:30-18:00 GMT)."We ran through the streets. then Israel started bombing this area non-stop, from 9pm to 7am this morning," one woman told the BBC on Friday.The bombing there has left thousands of people with nowhere to go. On Friday another resident told the BBC people were trapped under the rubble of their homes."Ambulances cannot get here. People are screaming but we cannot pull them out," he said.In northern Gaza, the Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli forces had ordered the evacuation of the Al-Quds hospital.The hospital is currently home to more than 400 patients and 12,000 displaced civilians, according to the Red Crescent.The humanitarian organisation called on the "international community to act urgently". A doctors' group, Physicians for Human Rights Israel, said it filed a petition to Israel's Supreme Court warning that Al-Quds hospital could not be evacuated. "In its response, the state announced that it would not attack the hospital for the time being," the group said, as it warned against harming civilians during combat, violating international law, and damaging medical services.Meanwhile the NGO Save the Children has warned that the lives of a million children in Gaza "hang in the balance".The aid agency has called for the urgent medical evacuation of ill and injured children from the enclave, and warns of increased deaths as a direct result of severe medical supply shortages and power blackouts.Israel says it is investigating after the compound of a Gazan church was damaged by an air strike against Hamas on Thursday.A building near to the Saint Porphyrius Church in Gaza City partially collapsed in the attack.Hamas officials said 16 people died, while Israel said it was aware of reports of casualties. US congressman Justin Amash said several of his relatives who had been sheltering in the church compound were killed as a result of the Israeli air strike."The Palestinian Christian community has endured so much. Our family is hurting badly," he wrote on X.The Israel Defense Forces said its fighter jets had hit a nearby Hamas command and control centre that was being used to carry out rocket attacks."As a result of the IDF strike, a wall of a church in the area was damaged. We are aware of reports on casualties. The incident is under review," it said."The IDF can unequivocally state that the church was not the target of the strike."Based on images released on Friday, it appeared that while the main building of the church suffered some damage, it was the adjacent building within the compound that suffered a collapse.Photos seen by BBC Verify show a large amount of debris spilling onto the road.The Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem expressed its "strongest condemnation of the Israeli air strike that has struck its church compound".Saint Porphyrius is the oldest church still in use in Gaza, with the current structure dating back to the 12th Century. There are around 1,000 Christians in Gaza, most of whom are Greek Orthodox. Hamas said that up to 500 people were sheltering at the site, although this number cannot be verified.	
21/10/2023 10:46:00	The forgotten Israeli hostages kept by Hamas in Gaza for years - BBC News	The anguish over some 200 people kidnapped by Hamas in its brutal attack on Israel is in the spotlight - but Hamas has been holding at least two Israelis for years.Very little has been heard about Ethiopian-Israeli Avera Mengistu and Bedouin Arab Israeli Hisham al-Sayed, seized in 2014 and 2015 respectively.The relatives of two dead Israeli soldiers are also tormented by the fact that Hamas has been holding their remains in Gaza since 2014. Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul were killed during a war between Israel and Hamas that year.Hamas - backed by Iran and regarded by Western nations as a terrorist group - has previously demanded a high price for releasing captive Israelis. They are used as Hamas bargaining chips.Aviram Shaul, brother of Oron, says that for nearly 10 years his family has had no news from Hamas about where it is keeping Oron's body, no sign that Oron will be returned.In 2014 the army found Oron's helmet and bulletproof vest in a Hamas tunnel in Gaza. But since then, Aviram told the BBC, "I feel Israelis forgot about them [the two dead soldiers]". "Now is a good chance to bring my brother back, because we're talking about 200 families with relatives held hostage in Gaza. The government did not do enough to bring my brother back, but now they have to make a big effort." He said now "Israel needs to do a humanitarian deal to get the hostages out". "If Hamas wants electricity, water, they must give us the hostages and soldiers' bodies and Israel does nothing if they don't want to."After secret negotiations in 2011 Israel got the abducted soldier Gilad Shalit back - but in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners held in its jails.Israel is now determined to wipe out Hamas and is inflicting huge casualties and damage on Gaza with air strikes. So any new prisoner swap would be both difficult and controversial. As the Gaza death toll mounts, Palestinian fury at Israel intensifies.Hagai Hadas, formerly an Israeli military commander and Mossad intelligence officer, played a key role in negotiating Shalit's release. He told the BBC that such prisoner deals with Palestinian kidnappers were "a political issue" and in the current emergency, with so much Israeli anger directed at Hamas, "it's not going to happen, it's impossible". He stressed that the controversial Shalit swap was possible politically for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the time - he felt secure enough - and the deal had been finalised two years before Shalit's release."Now I think the price won't be Hamas prisoners - it's to be paid using different tools," Mr Hadas said. He stressed that Israel now had various options: direct military rescues if the intelligence on the captives' locations was precise; use of "economic assets" - that is, payment; humanitarian options; or "to let Hamas leaders escape from Gaza, say to Qatar".On the latter option, he said, "you have to put them under stress, give them the idea that to save their lives they can make such a deal"."I believe the majority [of hostages] are in Hamas hands, but several are not. I'm almost sure that Israel is making every effort to locate them and try to bring them out by military means."He said that "even in a full-scale war in Gaza, Israel will push for a deal to get the hostages released, it will try to the last second to find a solution". "We value life and are willing to pay for life."The two Israeli civilian hostages held by Hamas since 2014 "were not kidnapped", Mr Hadas said, but "they went to Gaza, they were not mentally fit". "It's a big difference - we've had nothing similar to what we experienced on 7 October," he said, referring to the massacre by Hamas.Hamas claims that Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed are soldiers, but official Israeli documents seen by Human Rights Watch show that both are civilians who were exempted from military service.Tila Fenta has led a campaign to get Avera released and feels let down by the Israeli state - though she says the international spotlight on Gaza hostages now might help her cause."I want to believe that the chances for Avera have improved, but I say that in all sorrow," she told the BBC. She stressed that "we are still in shock - all Israelis are" since the Hamas attack and mass hostage-taking that killed about 1,400 Israelis.She said the campaigners felt "devastated" by Israel's failure for all these years to secure the return of Avera and Hisham."They're not soldiers, both are sick - they have mental issues - and Hamas captured them against all humanity," she said.She linked the lack of progress over Avera and Hisham to their disadvantaged background and discrimination in Israeli society towards Ethiopian Jews and Bedouin Arabs."I think Avera is a man who society doesn't like so much, because of his colour, mental illness problem and having grown up in a poor area of Ashkelon. "I think all this made him not wanted in society. If he was a bit brighter, or from a good area the treatment would be different. I know this isn't the time to say something wrong about my country, but the truth must be told." She said big human rights organisations should also have done more. "The same goes for the Bedouin - both are disadvantaged."A third young Israeli citizen, Jumaa Abu Ghanima, is believed to have crossed into Gaza in 2016 and is still missing. A Bedouin Arab, like Hisham, he may be in Hamas hands, but there is no confirmation.Before illegally entering the Gaza Strip, both Avera and Hisham had gone missing repeatedly, and had had psychiatric treatment, Human Rights Watch research shows.In January Hamas released a short undated video clip of a man who mumbled in Hebrew: "I am the captive Avera Mengistu. For how much longer will I remain in captivity with my friends." The Mengistu family confirmed his identity, the Free Avera campaign told the BBC.Prime Minister Netanyahu told Avera's mother Agurnesh that the government had "confirmation" that her son was still alive. He said Israel "does not stop its efforts to return Avera Mengistu and the rest of our captives and missing persons".In June 2022 Hamas released a video showing Hisham al-Sayed in captivity. Hisham's father Shaaban al-Sayed confirmed his identity. Hamas said only that Hisham's health had deteriorated - no more details were given. He could be seen lying attached to a ventilator beside what appeared to be his Israeli-issued ID card.Tzur Goldin, brother of the late Hadar Goldin, whose remains are still in Gaza, has urged Israel to adopt a clear policy to tackle Hamas kidnapping."Kidnapping is directed against families and is designed to break up societies. We have become accustomed to a certain security situation, to a certain conduct. We have become accustomed to it being convenient for the captives and the missing to be on the sidelines," he said, quoted by Israel National News - Arutz Sheva. "There is a round of fighting, followed by silence, followed by another round and more silence."Freeing any of the Hamas hostages looks likely to be a messy, controversial affair. "It's a dilemma everywhere in doing deals with terrorists," Hagai Hadas told the BBC. "You have contradictory options, they can be good or bad."	
21/10/2023 07:47:00	Five members of the same family were killed in Gaza air strikes, US relatives say - BBC News	A mother-of-four who died with two of her children in an Israeli air strike on Gaza has been described as intelligent and kind by her family in Minnesota. Heba, 42, was killed when her family home was hit.An ocean away in Blaine, Minnesota her relatives were glued to social media, hoping to hear news of their safety.Instead, they were devastated to learn that in total, five relatives were killed. "Our life has come to a standstill," Jehad Adwan told the BBC, adding that he and his wife have been gripped with anxiety and grief since learning of the deaths. "No-one is spared the trauma and suffering," he said.Several generations had lived in the housing complex that was home to about 30 people in Khan Younis, which is the hometown of his wife, Fatma Abumousa.Mr Adwan said their home was struck twice last Sunday."It was very surreal, to see your hometown is being bombed in front of you, and you're sitting thousands of miles away, and you don't know whether your family is safe," he said.Heba, one of the victims, was Ms Abumousa's sister-in-law. She was an accomplished architect and author, Mr Adwan said. He described her as a "very highly educated, very kind woman".Her 18-year-old son, Hmaid, also died. Mr Adwan said he had just finished high school and was looking to study engineering in Germany, and described him as "very brilliant", Also killed was his younger brother, seven-year-old Abdelrahman, who had just started first grade.Another nephew of Ms Abumousa's, five-year-old Yusef, was killed. Mr Adwan said he was playing with his cousins when the airstrike hit their home.Hani, a cousin of Ms Abumousa's in his 40s, was also killed. Mr Adwan said he went to rescue his nephews after the first blast, and was killed by the second.Heba's two other children, 12-year-old Sham and 16-year-old Abdullah, were both seriously injured with shrapnel wounds to the back and the leg and are in hospital, Mr Adwan said. Yusef's siblings, two children aged 12 and eight, were also wounded in the blast. Some of the victims were relatives who lived in north Gaza, Mr Adwan said, but had evacuated south after orders from the Israeli army. The couple says they have watched on horrified since the war began on 7 October, after Hamas broke out of the Gaza Strip and attacked Israeli civilians in nearby towns. About 1,400 Israelis were killed in the attacks, officials said. In Gaza, health officials said more than 4,000 people have been killed so far as fighting between Israel and Hamas continues.Mr Adwan said the situation was made even more difficult by the lack of power in Gaza, which has limited the amount of information the couple is able to get on their loved ones. Since hearing about the deaths, the couple has been feeling "a lot of anguish", he said, as Ms Abumousa was very close to the children that were killed. Ms Abumousa, who moved to the US three years ago and is a lab technician, worked in a Gaza hospital during the 2014 war. "It was a very hard time," she recalled. "But I think this time is at least one hundred times harder." Israel has said that its mission is to eliminate Hamas in the Gaza Strip, but Mr Adwan said his family members are all innocent civilians who were indiscriminately killed by the Israeli army. "Hmaid, Abelrahman, Yusef, Heba, Hani and all the other kids that were injured belonged to no political party," he said. "Their only guilt is that they are Palestinian civilians." Mr Adwan said he does not see a quick resolution to this conflict."What I really hope for is for the Palestinians to be recognised as a people, as human beings who deserve and demand freedom, who deserve to be treated equally like any other human beings on earth," he said.He has also criticised attempts by the US government to block a UN resolution for a ceasefire.The US vetoed a UN Security Council resolution on Wednesday that would have called for humanitarian pauses in the conflict to allow humanitarian aid access to the Gaza Strip.The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the US wanted to let its own diplomatic efforts "play out"."There has to be a resolution for this, otherwise the cycle of violence will keep coming back," said Mr Adwan.	
21/10/2023 03:44:00	Judith and Natalie Raanan: Hamas frees two US hostages - BBC News	Hamas has released two US hostages who were abducted during the Palestinian group's deadly raid on Israel this month.Israel confirmed they had received mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan from Hamas at the Gaza boundary.The pair were freed for "humanitarian reasons", Hamas said.US President Joe Biden said he was overjoyed at their release and confirmed he had spoken with the Raanans on the phone.They were the first captives released since the gunmen raided Israel on 7 October, killing 1,400 people and taking around 200 hostages.Palestinian officials say more than 4,000 people have been killed in Gaza, which has been under Israeli bombardment.Brig Gen Gal Hirsch, together with members of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), received the two hostages from Hamas at the boundary of the Palestinian enclave on Friday evening, said the Israeli prime minister's office.The Raanans were taken to a military base in the centre of the country, where family members were waiting, said the PM's office. The mother and daughter were staying at Kibbutz Nahal Oz in southern Israel when they were abducted during the Hamas incursion.The 59-year-old Illinois mother and her 17-year-old daughter, who recently graduated from high school, are both residents of Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an "overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs".Natalie's uncle, Avi Zamir, said the family were "extremely joyful". Evanston Rabbi Meir Hecht told the BBC the Jewish community in the suburb was "elated", adding that his phone had been constantly ringing since they were freed. "We have so much gratitude to the almighty God for this miracle," said Rabbi Hecht, adding: "We still have deep pain for all those hostages that are still there."At a Friday night vigil in Evanston for the hostages held by Hamas, a close friend of Judith, Yehudis Hecht, said their lives had been "turned into a nightmare" when they heard the two had been taken. "We are praying that they have quick healing from all that they have endured and we are praying for all Israel and a safe return of all hostages," she said. The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack. Tamar Ranaan and her partner, Yehiel, survived by hiding in the safe room of their home. Mr Biden thanked the Qatari government for its mediation efforts in the release of the two women on Friday.US officials have been "working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas", he said.A Hamas spokesman, Abu Ubaida, said the mother and daughter had been released "for humanitarian reasons, and to prove to the American people and the world that the claims made by Biden and his fascist administration are false and baseless".CNN reported that the mother had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross. Judith Raanan was born in Israel, worked in the US as an aesthetician and life coach, and often used her Hebrew name, Yehudit, reported the Chicago Tribune. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker released a statement saying: "I cannot wait to welcome them back home after demonstrating immense strength and bravery in the face of unthinkable terror."As of Friday, at least 32 American citizens had been confirmed dead this month in the Israel-Hamas conflict, while 10 remained unaccounted for, according to the US state department.  The US and UK have each said they are working with Qatari officials to help secure the release of their own citizens. Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement: "We will continue our dialogue with both the Israelis and Hamas, and we hope these efforts will lead to the release of all civilian hostages from every nationality." Other countries with nationals being held in Gaza include Argentina, Germany, France, Thailand and Portugal. The Ranaans were part of an extended family caught up in the attack.Another eight family members are missing from Kibbutz Be'eri. Three were killed, including a carer.BBC News has verified the identities of the other relatives who are feared kidnapped in Gaza. Dr Shoshan Haran, 67, her daughter Adi Shoham, 38, Adi's partner, Tal Shoham, 38, and their children, Naveh, 8, and Yahel, 3, are believed to have been snatched from their home. According to Fair Planet, the non-profit that Dr Haran founded, a phone that belonged to her husband, Avshalom, was tracked to Gaza and they believe the whole family was taken. Avshalom Haran - an economist and dual German-Israel citizen - is now dead, the BBC has confirmed. He was 66. Sharon Avigdori, 52, her daughter, Noam, 12, and Lilach Kipnis, 60, are also believed to have been abducted. Lilach's husband, Eviatar Kipnis, who was 66 and had Italian citizenship, was killed, the family said. Paul Vincent Castelvi, who was Eviatar Kipnis's carer, was also killed.Additional reporting by Max Matza.	
21/10/2023 01:01:00	Palestinians under attack as Israeli settler violence surges in the West Bank - BBC News	Abed Wadi was getting dressed for the funeral when the message arrived. It was an image, forwarded to him by a friend, of a group of masked men posing with axes, a petrol canister, and a chainsaw, with text printed on the image in Hebrew and Arabic."To all the rats in the sewers of Qusra village, we are waiting for you and we will not mourn you," the text said. "The day of revenge is coming." Qusra was Wadi's village, in the northern part of the West Bank near Nablus. The funeral that day was for four Palestinians from the village. Three had been killed the previous day - Wednesday 11 October - after Israeli settlers entered Qusra and attacked a Palestinian family home. The fourth was shot dead in clashes with Israeli soldiers that followed.The following day, the Qusra villagers were preparing to set out for a hospital half an hour away and return with the bodies of the dead. To do so, they would need to travel across land that is dotted with Israeli settlements, where the risk of violence, high even in ordinary times, has risen dramatically in the two weeks since the Hamas attack that launched a war with Israel.Wadi put his phone down and continued getting dressed. There were four men in refrigerators in the hospital who needed to be brought home. He was not going to be deterred by a threat, he said. He had heard too many.There was no way for Wadi to know that, in a few hours' time, hardline Israeli settlers would confront the funeral procession and his own brother and young nephew would be shot dead."If we had delayed one or even two days, what good would it have done?" Wadi said, sitting in the shaded courtyard of his family home in Qusra."Do you think that the settlers would have left this place on the second day?"According to the UN's humanitarian office, the week that followed Hamas's murderous attack was the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank since it began reporting fatalities in 2005, with at least 75 Palestinians killed by the Israeli military or settlers, and incidents of settler violence up from an average of three a day to eight. In one raid on a Palestinian refugee camp, and a rare air strike in the region, on Thursday 12th, Israeli forces killed at least 12 people, Palestinian officials said, and Israeli police said one officer was killed.There was "a real risk" of the occupied territory "spiralling out of control", the UN said this week.Palestinian residents of the West Bank say that while the world's attention is drawn to the unfolding disaster in Gaza, Israeli settlers are taking advantage by entering villages and expelling, and even killing, Palestinian civilians.In at least three cases, according to video footage or eyewitness testimony from villagers, the settlers have been wearing military uniforms or accompanied by the Israeli military in their attacks.The first three men who died in Qusra had gone to defend a family in a house on the outskirts of the village, after settlers approached the house and began throwing rocks at it, several residents told the BBC. They say the settlers then opened fire at the Palestinian neighbours who came to assist, killing two teenagers and a young man - Hasan Abu Sorour, 16, Obayda Abu Sorour, 17, and Musab Abu Reda, 25 - and gravely wounding several others. Moath Odeh, aged 21, was killed later in clashes with soldiers. Among the wounded were a father and his six-year-old daughter, who lived at the house, who were shot in the face and in the abdomen respectively, according to two people who received the dead and wounded at a nearby medical clinic.One of those assisting at the clinic was Amer Odeh, a cousin of two of the victims. It fell to Amer to call Said Odeh, the father of 17-year-old Obayda. "I told him, your son is lightly injured," Amer said, in an interview alongside Said in Qusra on Tuesday. "I could not give him this shock over the phone." Said rushed to the medical centre. "They told me that my son was injured but there was no way for me to see him at that moment," he recalled, his eyes shiny with tears. "I told them I wanted to see my son now, and I entered that room and I saw that by the grace of God he had been martyred."The following day was set to be the funeral for the four victims. Abed Wadi put the image of the masked men with axes and chainsaws out of his mind and joined the funeral convoy bringing the bodies back from the hospital to Qusra.As the cars and ambulances made their way along the Nablus-Ramallah road, the convoy was ambushed by hardline Israeli settlers. In the clash that followed, according to video footage and eyewitness testimony, settlers pelted the convoy with stones, some members of the funeral convoy threw stones back, and the Israeli settlers and soldiers responded with live fire.In the "chaos and heavy, random gunfire," Abed Wadi lost track of his brother, Ibrahim, a 63-year-old local politician with the Fatah Movement, and Ibrahim's son Ahmed, a 24-year-old law student. Video footage of part of the confrontation appears to show Ahmed and others running away from the gunfire, before Ahmed is cut down by bullets on the road."They told me my nephew was shot twice in his stomach and once in his neck, and my brother was shot in his waist, towards his heart," Wadi said."There were no weapons in our funeral convoy," he said. "Usually we would fly the Palestinian flag from the cars but we did not even fly our flag, because of the fear."Residents in Qusra told the BBC this week that fear had permeated the village. Last weekend was the beginning of olive season in the area, but residents who depend on the harvest for their income said they would not go to the groves on the outskirts of the village for fear of settlers shooting.There had already been a significant increase in violence by Israeli settlers this year, even before the Hamas attack, according to UN data, with more than 100 incidents reported each month and about 400 people driven from their land between January and August.Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem told the BBC that since the attack, it had documented "a concerted and organised effort by settlers to use the fact that the entire international and local attention is focused on Gaza and the north of Israel to try to seize land in the West Bank".Partial data compiled by B'Tselem, covering the first six days after the Hamas attack, recorded at least 46 separate incidents in which it said settlers threatened, physically attacked or damaged the property of Palestinians in the West Bank."A lot of shepherding families and communities have fled because they were threatened in the past week by settlers," said Roy Yellin, a spokesman for B'Tselem. "Settlers have been giving residents a deadline to leave and telling them if they don't they will be harmed. And some villages have been totally emptied out."One of those villages was Wadi al-Siq, near Ramallah, previously home to a Palestinian Bedouin community of about 200. "For months we have been facing harassment and attacks from settlers day and night, but since the start of the war the attacks increased," said Abdul Rahman Kaabna, 48, a farmer from Wadi al-Siq. On 9 October, a group of approximately 60 settlers, many dressed in military uniforms, attacked the community, according to three now-exiled residents. "They attacked us with weapons and terrified everyone," Kaabna said. "Then they gave us one hour to go out with our sheep and threatened us to death if we didn't leave."The residents walked more than 10km (6.2 miles) to escape, said another resident, Ali Arara, 35. "The settlers stole everything from our homes," he said. "My daughter was terrified. They beat us and left us with nothing."According to B'Tselem and Yesh Din, another Israeli human rights group which monitors West Bank violence, the intimidation and forced displacement reported in Wadi al-Siq has been repeated in communities across the territory since 7 October. In one of the most shocking incidents caught on film in the past week, an Israeli settler entered a Palestinian village called At-Tuwani near Hebron and shot an unarmed Palestinian resident in the stomach at point blank range, while an Israeli soldier appeared to look on.The incident began when two armed settlers, accompanied by a soldier, attacked a home on the outskirts of the village, according to three residents including the homeowner. "Three Israelis came to my house, they were armed, and one was wearing the uniform of the army," said Musab Rabai, 36."One of the settlers came into the house, pushed me and beat me on the head with the gun and told me he was going to shoot me."Neighbours responded to Rabai's shouts for help, he said. Among them was Zakriha Adra, a father of four. Video footage filmed by Adra's cousin, Basel, shows the settler who allegedly beat Rabai and the Israeli soldier standing a short distance away from the group of Palestinian neighbours. The armed settler then suddenly approaches Adra, strikes him with his rifle and shoots him in the stomach from just a few feet away.Throughout the encounter, Adra appears to be holding his arms by his sides in a non-threatening manner. According to the family, Adra is now in hospital in critical condition. "He survived but the bullet has done a lot of damage inside his stomach," said Basel, his cousin. Musab Rabai, whose house was attacked, said the shooting had been a culmination of days of threatening behaviour and property destruction by the settlers. "Since Saturday they have been standing around the village armed with guns and using a bulldozer to destroy trees," he said. "The men here in the village have been sleeping in shifts, only a few hours each, so there is always someone awake in case the settlers attack."The BBC asked the Yesha Council, the umbrella organisation for the settlers in the West Bank and elsewhere, to comment for this story but they declined. Moti Yogev, the acting head of the Binyamin Council, which also represents settlers in the region, said that violent settlers "belonged to the fringes" of the settler community. "If they do exist, they should be dealt with like any other criminal," he said.The Israeli military and Israeli police force did not respond to multiple requests for comment. "The most tragic thing is that the violence by these extreme settlers does not produce any response from the Israeli military," said Dov Khenin, a former Israeli politician turned peace activist. "And the violence has its own purpose, to get rid of these small Palestinian communities, to eject them from their homes."The fear for many Palestinians now is that the situation in the West Bank will only get worse. Israel's National Security Minister, Itar Ben Gvir, announced last week that the government would purchase 10,000 rifles to arm Israeli civilians, including those in West Bank settlements - a move that threatens to further blur the lines between armed settlers and members of the military in the occupied territory.In Qusra, Abed Wadi said he had heard the news about the 10,000 rifles. He shook his head. "It won't change anything for the people of Qusra," he said.Wadi was sitting in his courtyard, surrounded by posters bearing the image of his brother, his nephew, and the four other men from the village who were killed last week."We have always seen the rifle in the hands of the settlers, they have been shooting at us for a long time," he said.But something had changed, he said. It seemed as though the settlers had become more aggressive, more radical. "Farm houses are being burned, olive trees cut down, cars broken into, land is being stolen," Wadi said."And this is just our village. If you were to look to the next village and the next village, you would find anger and pain in every one," he said. "And you would see no end to it."Alla Badarna contributed to this report.

20/10/2023 21:27:00	Saudi prince slams Hamas, Israel and the West - BBC News	A speech made by Prince Turki al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia this week on the current violence in the Middle East is unusually frank for a senior member of the Saudi royal family. It has been widely acknowledged as the clearest indicator yet of the Saudi leadership's thinking on the situation.Prince Turki, a widely respected elder statesman in Saudi circles, has publicly condemned both Hamas and Israel for attacking civilians, following Hamas's 7 October attack on southern Israel and the subsequent Israeli bombardment of Gaza. There were no heroes, he said, only victims.Such is the groundswell of Arab anger at those Israeli air strikes that Prince Turki, who was addressing a US audience at Rice University in Houston, is a rare Arab voice of criticism of Hamas in the current climate.The group's acts, he said, went against Islamic injunctions not to harm civilians. The majority of those killed or kidnapped by Hamas were civilians.Prince Turki, a careful, thoughtful ex-diplomat and spy chief, balanced his condemnation of Hamas with that of Israel, which he accused of "indiscriminate bombing of innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza" and the "indiscriminate arrest of Palestinian children, women and men in the West Bank". He took issue with the US media's use of the phrase "unprovoked attack" in reference to the 7 October raid, saying: "What more provocation is required.. than what Israel has done to the Palestinian people for three-quarters of a century?"He added that "all militarily occupied people have a right to resist occupation".Prince Turki also condemned Western politicians for "shedding tears when Israelis are killed by Palestinians", but refusing to "even express sorrow when Israelis kill Palestinians". President Joe Biden has since said, during his visit to Israel, that the US mourned all innocent victims.So what lies behind this speech, which the prince must have known would be widely reported? It is unlikely that he would have spoken without first checking in with his country's Royal Court, run by the all-powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who held talks with Rishi Sunak on Thursday.Prince Turki has quite a pedigree. His father was the popular and modernising King Faisal, who was assassinated in 1975. His brother was Saudi Arabia's longstanding foreign minister until his death in 2015. Prince Turki's US and British education at Princeton, Cambridge and Georgetown has given him an invaluable perspective on Western culture and thinking, as well as providing him with lifelong contacts amongst decision-makers in Washington and Whitehall. He went on to become Saudi Arabia's spy chief, running the foreign intelligence department for 24 years, with special responsibility for Afghanistan. Following the 9/11 attacks in 2001 he became Saudi Arabia's ambassador in London and then Washington. In London, his media spokesman at the embassy was the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was eventually murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by Saudi government agents in 2018. Saudi Arabia blamed this on an unauthorised "rogue operation".Now aged 78, with no formal position in the Saudi government, Prince Turki al-Faisal nevertheless provides an intriguing insight into Saudi thinking on the few occasions when he speaks publicly at international forums.Saudi Arabia's rulers don't like Hamas. In fact, many of the governments in the region don't like it either. The rulers of Egypt, Jordan, UAE and Bahrain see Hamas and its revolutionary brand of so-called "political Islam" as a threat to their secular rule. The Palestinian Authority, based on Yasser Arafat's Fatah party, was effectively chased out of Gaza by Hamas in 2007. Some of its members were thrown off the roofs of high buildings during a short-lived internecine conflict.Although Hamas maintains a political office in Qatar its main backer is Iran, which has long been a historic rival to Saudi Arabia. Although the Saudis and Iranians formally agreed to end their dispute in March this year, there remains considerable mutual mistrust between them. Despite this, they have jointly condemned Israel's bombing of Gaza and reaffirmed their support for a Palestinian state. It is hard to believe now but only two weeks ago, prior to the Hamas raid, Saudi Arabia was well on the way to normalising ties with Israel, just as the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco have done. This is now on hold. Several analysts believe that Hamas's deadly raid into Israel was partly prompted by a desire to derail that normalisation that would have left Hamas and Iran sidelined in a new Middle East.Will things ever return to the status quo in the region?Right now, it is hard to see that happening, with a wounded Israel in no mood for compromise and nervous Arab governments eyeing the growing anti-Israel protests on the streets. But when the current conflict in Gaza ends, as it must do, then it may well be Saudi Arabia's deep pockets that help fund its reconstruction. It will be worth watching Prince Turki's speeches for the Saudi view of whatever comes next.	
20/10/2023 18:22:00	Rishi Sunak renews plea for Gaza aid during visit to Egypt - BBC News	Rishi Sunak has met the Palestinian Authority president in Egypt as part of a tour of the Middle East.Mr Sunak and Mahmoud Abbas jointly condemned Hamas's attacks on Israel and the PM "expressed his deep condolences" for civilian deaths in Gaza.He also met Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, agreeing the need to avoid a "contagion of conflict".The PM called for the swift reopening of the Egypt-Gaza border, where some 20 aid trucks are poised to enter.In a summary of the conversation between Mr Sunak and Mr Abbas, Downing Street said they "condemned Hamas's terrorism and stressed that Hamas do not represent the Palestinian people"."The prime minister underscored his commitment to opening up humanitarian access to Gaza to alleviate the suffering of thousands of people who desperately need food, water and medicine," the statement added.Mr Abbas is head of the Palestinian Authority, which has control over areas of the occupied West Bank, but not the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.In his earlier meeting with President El-Sisi, Downing Street said Mr Sunak "praised Egypt's efforts in attempting to secure the delivery of aid" through the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. The statement also noted the pair agreed "global leaders should do everything possible to avoid a contagion of conflict in the region" as well as make "every effort" to stop terrorism and protect civilians.Speaking to reporters ahead of boarding a plane back to the UK, Mr Sunak said getting humanitarian aid to those in Gaza is an "immediate priority" and the UK has been in discussions with Egypt on how to provide "practical assistance on the ground".He also said the reopening of the border had been part of his conversations with Middle East leaders, adding that he was "very pleased that that will now imminently happen".Shortly after Mr Sunak spoke, US President Joe Biden said aid trucks were likely to cross into Gaza within the "next 24 to 48 hours".Before travelling to Egypt on Friday, Mr Sunak thanked the emir of Qatar for his efforts to help secure the release of hostages taken by Hamas.Meeting in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh, Mr Sunak and Qatar's leader Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani agreed to do "everything possible" to avoid an escalation of violence across the region, Downing Street said.The United Nations says the first aid delivery into Gaza via the Rafah border crossing in Egypt is expected to take place "in the next day or so".The territory has been under a "complete siege" since last Monday, with Israel blocking cross-border supplies of water, electricity and fuel. Israeli warplanes and artillery have been bombarding the territory after more than 1,400 people were killed in Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October. Palestinian officials say more than 4,000 people have since been killed in the Gaza Strip.Dozens of trucks are backed up at the crossing on the Egyptian border, carrying food, water, and medicine but no fuel. It is believed only 20 will initially be allowed to cross.Mr Sunak began his Middle East tour on Thursday, starting in Israel, where Mr Sunak said he was proud to support the country in its "long war" against Hamas. On Thursday, Mr Sunak urged Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to support stability in the region.Downing Street said the pair agreed the "loss of innocent lives in Israel and Gaza over the last two weeks has been horrific" and "underscored the need to avoid any further escalation in the region".It came after a short visit to Tel Aviv, where he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and said he was "proud" to stand with Israel in its "darkest hour" - declaring the UK's backing for its fight against Hamas. On Saturday, Egypt will host a summit on the future of the Palestinian issue, with Arab and UN leaders attending.	
20/10/2023 18:06:00	Israel aims to cut Gaza ties after war with Hamas - BBC News	Israel has suggested that the long-term aim of its military campaign in Gaza is to sever all links with the territory.Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said that once Hamas had been defeated, Israel would end its "responsibility for life in the Gaza Strip".Before the conflict, Israel supplied Gaza with most of its energy needs and monitored imports into the territory.The statement comes as Israel continues its strikes on Gaza and aid remains blocked on the border with Egypt.The bombardments are a response to attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,400 people were killed and 203 taken hostage. Israel is now poised to launch a ground offensive.On Friday, Mr Gallant told a parliamentary committee that the first stage of the campaign was meant to destroy Hamas's infrastructure, according to a statement from his office.Israeli forces, he added, would then launch "operations at lower intensity" to eliminate "pockets of resistance".The third phase, he said, "will require the removal of Israel's responsibility for life in the Gaza Strip, and the establishment of a new security reality for the citizens of Israel".Although Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, the UN regards the strip - along with the West Bank and East Jerusalem - as occupied land and considers Israel responsible for the basic needs of its population.Israel has previously allowed Gazans to cross the border for work. It has also overseen imports into the territory to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas.Following the 7 October attacks it cut electricity supplies, as well as deliveries of food and medicines. The UN calls the situation there "beyond catastrophic".The US and Egypt have reached a deal allowing some supplies to start bringing relief Gaza's 2.2 million residents.An initial convoy of 20 trucks had been expected to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah border crossing on Friday, but they are still stuck on the Egyptian side.Humanitarian organisations say much more aid is needed.On Friday UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the crossing with a plea for aid trucks to be allowed into the territory."These trucks are not just trucks - they are a lifeline, they are the difference between life and death to many people in Gaza," he said. "What we need is to make them move."Meanwhile Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has confirmed that he will join several world leaders at a summit in Cairo on Saturday aimed at achieving a ceasefire.The event, hosted by Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, will involve talks on trying to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on a two-state solution.Those attending will also include Mr Guterres and representatives from the EU, as well as several Arab and European countries.	
20/10/2023 17:36:00	Gaza war: Vigil aims to pressure Israel's leaders over hostages - BBC News	"They don't say anything, we have no information", Shira Albagh says, holding a poster of her kidnapped daughter up towards the windows of the Israel Defence Forces' headquarters. "Liri needs to be back in her bed. She's 18 years old but she's my little baby and I want her back. I want to hug her. I want her back home."Shira and her husband Eli are among the hostage families keeping a pavement vigil in Tel Aviv. Israeli flags fly alongside pictures of the kidnapped - there are yellow ribbons tied around the trees. Banners urge action from the military leadership: "Bring our children home", "Prisoner exchange". There's also a sign saying "Bibi must resign" - the nickname Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is widely known by in Israel.  Mr Netanyahu is not seeing the public support that often swells around wartime leaders. Opinion polls show a majority of Israelis think he should stand down when the conflict is over. His approval rating has slumped and a survey of Jewish voters last week showed two thirds would opt for someone else.There is anger about the security failure that allowed Hamas to kill so many people and take 200 hostages. The Albaghs are, like so many hostage families, wary of stepping into politics or criticising the leaders they are relying on to save their daughter, but their faith in their country has been shaken. "We want the government to put its attention…to talk with them (Hamas) to release the kidnapped", Eli says.Shira says she holds Israel responsible for failing to keep her daughter safe but also the rest of the world for not recognising the threat of Hamas. She remains confident that Israel will bring the hostages home, somehow. Polling shows support for the military is still strong.Mr Netanyahu, the longest-serving Israeli leader, had already faced months of divisive protests over planned constitutional changes. He is also charged with corruption. "He (Netanyahu) is evil" declares Slomit Kobner, who has just been told her friend Mayanna Herschovitz's body has been found in her kibbutz near Gaza. "He cannot lead Israel. I don't see any way he or his government can stay. The pain is so bad." In a text message at 11:15 local time (08:15 GMT) on the morning of the attacks, Mayanna said her family had been hiding from gunmen for more than three hours but the army still hadn't arrived to save them. That is the last Slomit heard from her friend - she was hoping they'd been kidnapped.Slomit is left wing and has protested against Mr Netanyahu for years: "Now everybody in Israel knows that he can't be anymore the prime minister after this," she says."He can go now, or he can go after."Mr Netanyahu, 73, has served three times as prime minister over 16 years in office. He casts himself as a strong man dedicated to national security. His own brother was killed in action leading a successful special forces raid - Operation Entebbe - to rescue Israeli hostages held in Uganda after the hijacking of a flight from Tel Aviv in 1976.  But in this crisis Mr Netanyahu has been criticised for being slow to embrace the families of hostages but quick to turn to the US for support. Families are waiting to hear how the kidnapped will be returned. Many Israelis wonder exactly how the declared "war on Hamas" will be fought.Even longstanding supporters are questioning Mr Netanyahu's future. "The leadership have failed, they're in a very bad position" says Dor Harlap, who co-chairs a Jewish cultural organisation called Zionist Horizon. "After the war he should go to the public with the results of the war and ask for another chance. I'm not sure the public will give it to him. I'd vote for him but maybe this is the last session of Netanyahu."This year's demonstrations - the largest in Israel's history - followed years of restive politics and three prime ministers in 18 months. Dor, a committed Likud party voter, worries aging leaders are growing out of touch but wants responsibility taken more collectively. "The right wing and the left wing had the same agenda about Hamas and Gaza in the last 10 or 15 years. Maybe we should have new leadership for all of the parties."He's also critical of the widespread protests against Mr Netanyahu's judicial reforms. Thousands of reserve servicemen and woman threatened to join the revolt by refusing their orders because of concerns the plan to limit the checks and balances of Israel's supreme court would undermine Israel's democracy. Israel's president warned the country was heading for civil war. "Our enemies see that we are divided," Dor says."They see that in the military itself there are protestors and people who wouldn't agree to serve. They've been waiting for our weak point and this instability of the government isn't good for us."At the family's vigil, a car draws up and a man shouts that the months of protest have undermined national unity and let Hamas capitalise. A crowd gathers and a woman screams back as the police step in."This man tells me Bibi [Netanyahu] is the king, he's the best man in the world… I can't bear it" she says, enraged. "I have no country, I have only people. I wish they [Hamas] took Bibi instead of the children and all his government because they are not doing anything. For 10 days the state has been running by volunteers."A young man who has watched this confrontation play out pulls me aside further down the street. He is the quiet voice of Netanyahu support, nervous of giving his name. "He [Netanyahu] must carry on in this war" the man says determinedly. "I wish more citizens were like me, encouraging Bibi to have courage - be Churchill, not Chamberlain. Even if the world says otherwise, show what real moral superiority really is."Another air raid sends people running to the shelters once more - political divisions dropped under the common threat of Hamas rockets.  "You have to understand we are facing our worst enemy since the Nazis, and the internal political situation…no one really cares about it" says Dor Harlap."Most of the people are caring about their own families, their relatives in the reserves. We are caring about winning this war, then after that we'll go to elections, and we will kick out who we need to kick out."	
20/10/2023 16:58:00	French minister Darmanin spars with footballer Karim Benzema in Gaza row - BBC News	French football's "bad boy" Karim Benzema is threatening to go to court after Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin accused him of having links with the Muslim Brotherhood.The minister was reacting to remarks made by Benzema on X, formerly Twitter, in which he offered prayers to the people of Gaza as "victims again of unjust bombardments which spare neither women nor children".Noting his failure to express similar sympathy for the estimated 1,400 Israeli victims of Hamas, Mr Darmanin said the former French striker was "well-known for his links with the Muslim Brotherhood"."We are fighting the hydra that is the Muslim Brotherhood, because it creates an atmosphere of jihadism," he told right-wing news channel CNews.The footballer, who now lives in Saudi Arabia and plays in the Saudi Pro League, authorised his Paris lawyer to issue a categorical denial - and to threaten legal action against Mr Darmanin for slander."Karim Benzema has never had the least relationship with this organisation," said Hugues Vigier."Praying for a civilian population living under bombs… is neither propaganda for Hamas, nor complicity in terrorism, nor an act of collaboration."It is natural compassion in the face of what many people qualify as war crimes… but which in no way detracts from the horror of the [Hamas] terrorist actions carried out on October 7," he said.He said Karim Benzema was also considering legal action against right-wing deputy Nadine Morano, who described him as an "element of propaganda for Hamas".Speaking subsequently on BFMTV, the interior minister refused to back down - saying he would only withdraw his comments if the footballer issued another tweet lamenting last Friday's Islamist murder of a schoolteacher in Arras."The [Muslim] Brotherhood is insidious. It uses all the means available in our society to get across its message of a strict Islam…. Not to see this is to be naive. Let's stop being naive!"The Muslim Brotherhood is the 80-year-old movement, founded in Egypt, which has provided the rationale for many modern-day Islamist organisations, including Hamas.Banned in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and many other Middle Eastern countries, it suffers no restriction in most of the EU, which does not regard it as terrorist.  Primarily an ideological movement, with no formal structure, its influence in Europe is mainly seen via front organisations which campaign for Islamic causes like the right of women to wear head-coverings.Mr Darmanin's attack on Karim Benzema came under immediate fire from the political left, which accused the minister of trying to make political hay.The 35-year-old former Real Madrid star has a difficult relationship with the French public. Though idolised by some, he has also won a reputation as a troublemaker.In 2021 he was given a year's suspended prison sentence after being convicted of complicity to commit blackmail over a sex-video featuring French team-mate Mathieu Valbuena."Darmanin is campaigning for 2027," said political commentator Philippe Moreau Chevrolet, pointing to the next presidential election."He's looking for the most effective way to send out a message to right-wing voters."The minister's entourage conceded there was "no judicial basis for proceeding against Benzema".However in off-the-record briefings to the French press they said the footballer has "displayed a steady move towards a strict Islam characteristic of Brotherhood ideology". They cited his refusal to sing the national anthem during appearances for France, and his "proselytism" on social media.Renowned lawyer Emmanuel Daoud told Le Figaro newspaper of his shock at Mr Darmanin's intervention."Is it tolerable for a man who [as interior minister] is also minister of religion to say that expressing any spiritual compassion with the people of Gaza makes someone necessarily guilty of being close to the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas?""We are very far from our basic laws."	
20/10/2023 16:38:00	Ballymoney: Refugee community garden grows green shoots for integration - BBC News	 A group of Syrian men have created a community garden for the people who helped them when they first moved to Northern Ireland.The four men have been working on the project in Ballymoney, County Antrim, for several months.Bassam Khalil moved to Portstewart, County Londonderry, in 2019.This was after he spent almost eight years living in a tent in a Lebanese refugee camp.Before coming to Northern Ireland, Bassam said his life was "very bad" and that there was "no future and no schools" for his children."But here, there's everything. Everything has changed."It's very quiet and lovely by the sea - the people are very kind."Bassam and the other three men came to Northern Ireland as refugees under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme.Since the summer, they have worked on transforming a patch of waste ground into a garden at the Building Communities Resource Centre (BCRC).Bassam said that as the BCRC organisation had helped them with English and settling into the community, they felt it was important to do something in return. Fergal Quinn, BCRC's ethnic communities officer, said the men wanted to give back after being received and welcomed into the community."Every Friday we met and every Friday, without fail, they would be here wanting to do as much as they could," he said."And they're getting something from this too. We appreciate it so much."Fergal said it is about helping to create a natural integration into the community."Community works best when it comes together. This empowers them - that, without you, we wouldn't be standing next to this beautiful garden."Conservation volunteers also helped with the project.Project officer David Fleming said: "The purpose is not just for the BCRC but for the whole community, the shops here, the community around Ballymoney and outlying towns."It brings people together; gets more socialising, more friends helping each other out if you're in trouble."Jonathan Hanna, a general manager with a manufacturing company which also wanted to be involved, said there is a lot of diversity among his firm's 300-strong workforce. He said with new employees joining from places such as India and eastern Europe, it was important for the company to be involved "to get relationships built and make people feel welcome in the local community". "We want to give something back to help out, so a lot of people got involved in their own time to design some of the equipment - they made it outside of work."Hopefully our own team members who are part of this community group can use it as well."	
20/10/2023 15:10:00	London mayor meets multi-faith leaders as hate crimes rise - BBC News	The mayor of London has held a roundtable meeting with Jewish and Muslim faith leaders following a rise in hate crimes in the capital.Mr Khan hosted the Community Security Trust (CST) and Tell MAMA to discuss measures to keep Londoners safe.It comes after Met Police figures showed a huge increase in both antisemitic and Islamophobic attacks during October.The mayor said it was "important to come together to stop hate crimes".He added that police would "take a zero tolerance approach".Speaking to the BBC after the event, Iman Atta, director of Tell MAMA, an organisation that supports victims of anti-Muslim attacks, said Palestinian Muslim families had "reported graffiti on their door stating killer, terrorist and murder, and Nazi symbols".She added that other Muslim women have "had death threats on the London Underground where a woman gestured to them that she will cut their heads".Jonny Newton, director of communications at CST, a group that helps to protect the Jewish community, said they were all "feeling very vulnerable at this time". He said the attacks had "dredged up inter-generational trauma and pain".According to Scotland Yard there were 218 antisemitic incidents across London between 1 and 18 October, up from 15 during the same period last year.The number of Islamophobic incidents also rose to 101, from 42 in the same time period.So far, 21 people have been arrested and officers have been working through 1,400 reports of potentially illegal content online.Jewish organisation Campaign Against Antisemitism has questioned the Met's handling of protests in the capital.It said the force had stopped the group from displaying images of Israeli children kidnapped by Hamas on van billboard screens in Parliament Square on Wednesday due to a pro-Palestinian vigil taking place nearby.The organisation also accused police of "physically restraining" its chief executive Gideon Falter.The Met said it had "no wish to limit freedom of expression", but had a "responsibility for public safety" and therefore "officers were keen to avoid the billboard vans becoming a point of tension or conflict"."There will be occasions where we try to avoid groups with strongly opposing views coming into immediate contact with each other," it added."We took similar actions on Saturday where we prevented pro-Palestinian demonstrators from reaching the area around the Israeli Embassy given their doing so would likely have led to an escalation in tension and a possible risk to public safety."Meanwhile, three Labour councillors in London have resigned over the party leadership's stance on what is happening in the Middle East.On Wednesday Kensington councillor Mona Ahmed and Hounslow councillor Lara Parizotto resigned.Ms Ahmed said she "condemned the killing of innocent civilians" and "expected the same" from her party. On Thursday, another councillor, Lotte Collett, who represents a ward in Haringey, resigned having said it was "shocking" that Sir Keir Starmer and his leadership team were not calling for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and accused it of failing to "condemn Israeli aggression as mounting breaches of international law are occurring".In an interview on LBC radio last week, Sir Keir was asked whether cutting off water and power supplies into Gaza would be appropriate as part of an Israeli response, to which he replied: "I think that Israel does have that right, it is an ongoing situation."Obviously, everything should be done within international law, but I don't want to step away from the core principles that Israel has a right to defend herself."Pro-Palestinian demonstrations took place outside the party's HQ on Friday morning, with people chanting "Labour Party shame on you" and "no more money for Israel's crimes".Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

20/10/2023 10:08:00	Chris Williamson: Former MP's Israel comment prompts hate crime probe - BBC News	Police are to investigate whether a former MP committed a hate crime in a social media post about Israel.Chris Williamson, ex-Labour MP for Derby North posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday night that "Israel has forfeited any right to exist".Derbyshire Police said they had received "multiple reports" about the comment.The force said it would now consider whether the post constituted a hate crime.A spokesperson said: "The force has received multiple reports relating to a tweet posted by Chris Williamson on the evening of 17 October regarding the Israel/Palestine conflict."We take reports of potential hate crimes seriously while also being mindful of freedom of speech and the rights of individuals to express their views."Sometimes the opinions will be made robustly and may cause offence but that does not necessarily mean that a law has been broken."It is important that we consider all elements of this report and we have recorded a non-crime hate incident to establish if any crime has been committed."This will be reviewed in due course and, once a decision has been reached, those who have reported the incident will be contacted directly, and an update posted on the force channels."In response, Mr Williamson said accusations of hate crime were "bogus".He also described the complaints as "an obvious waste of police time", which he said was itself an offence under the Criminal Law Act.Mr Williamson was elected as Labour's MP for Derby North in 2010 and re-elected in 2017 after losing the seat to the Conservatives in 2015.He stood as an independent in 2019 after being suspended by the party in a row over anti-Semitism.Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

20/10/2023 09:50:00	US warship intercepts missiles fired from Yemen 'potentially towards Israel' - BBC News	A US Navy warship has intercepted missiles and drones launched from Yemen by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement, US officials say.A Pentagon spokesman said the missiles had been launched "potentially towards targets in Israel".The USS Carney, a guided-missile destroyer, was operating in the northern Red Sea on Thursday.The Pentagon also said US troops in Iraq and Syria had been attacked several times in recent days.Washington is on alert for activity by Iran-backed groups as Israel continues to attack Hamas targets in Gaza.The Pentagon's Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said three land attack cruise missiles and several drones fired from Yemen had been downed.There were no injuries reported from the incident and a US official said the warship did not appear to be the target. "We cannot say for certain what these missiles and drones were targeting, but they were launched from Yemen, heading north along the Red Sea, potentially towards targets in Israel," he told reporters.Brig Ryder added that information about the nature of the activity was "still being processed" and the attack may "be ongoing"."Our defensive response was one that we would have taken for any similar threat in the region where we're able to do so against our interest personnel and our partners," he said. In Iraq, drones and rockets have been launched at several bases housing US and other international forces, the Pentagon said.One of the attacks caused injuries to "a small number of troops".Iraqi militant groups had warned the US against supporting Israeli actions against Hamas in Gaza.On Wednesday, a drone hit US forces in Syria, causing minor injuries, and another drone was brought down."While I'm not going to forecast any potential responses to these attacks, I will say that we will take all necessary actions to defend U.S. and coalition forces against any threat," Brig Ryder said.There are various US bases in the Middle East, with warships, troops and fighter aircraft.In the past week the US has sent two aircraft carriers, about 2,000 marines and support ships to the Middle East.There are "no plans or intentions" for their use, the White House says. But it means that if required, the US military assets would be in place to protect national security interests.Yemen's Houthi rebels, which the US says are responsible for these most recent attacks, are backed by Iran. The Houthis have been locked in a prolonged civil war with Yemen's official government - backed by Saudi Arabia - since 2014. The Pentagon's Gen Ryder said the US is still analysing the attacks in Yemen, Iraq and Syria."Our focus is going to be continuing to ensure we are deterring a potential broader regional conflict," he said, adding that there was currently no information showing a direct connection to the 7 October attacks by Hamas in Israel.	
20/10/2023 06:33:00	Residents leave as tension grows at Israel-Lebanon border - BBC News	For days, tensions have been high along the Lebanese border with Israel, with frequent exchanges of fire between heavily armed militants in Lebanon and the Israeli army. These skirmishes have prompted fears that the violence could escalate into a bigger confrontation. Not far from the frontier on the Lebanese side, in the southern town of Bint Jbeil, there was quiet in the streets. Most shops were closed. Many residents here, and in other border villages, have left, fearing that an escalation of the war between Israel and Hamas will turn this area, dominated by the powerful Shia Islamist group Hezbollah, into another front in the conflict.Half a dozen men, among the few people seen outside, sat around a plastic table. Some ate pizza; others were smoking. They did not seem to be concerned."I'm not going to leave unless [the situation] gets out of hand, which I doubt," 52-year-old Mohammed Baidoun said, under the watchful eye of a handful of Hezbollah minders, who came from multiple directions as soon as we arrived. "I have faith in the resistance that we have here... I believe deep down that [Hezbollah] will protect us."The question about what Hezbollah will do hangs over the whole country. The group, like Hamas, is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK, the US and others. Its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has remained silent since the Israel-Hamas war broke out. Naim Qassem, the Hezbollah number two, described the group as "fully ready", saying they would not be intimidated by calls from the US and others to stay away. But their secretive nature means it is difficult to know what preparations they could be making.Israel has long seen Hezbollah, which is also a social and political movement created in the 1980s, as a far more formidable force than Hamas: the group has a vast arsenal of weapons, including precision-guided missiles that can strike deep into Israeli territory, as well as tens of thousands of well-trained, battle-hardened fighters. Hezbollah's actions have been limited to cross-border strikes, along the UN-set Blue Line, the unofficial frontier between Lebanon and Israel. The group has exchanged missiles and artillery fire with the Israeli military several times a day, while its allied Palestinian factions have also carried out attacks, including several attempted incursions into Israel from southern Lebanon. The confrontations have resulted in deaths on both sides, including civilians.Residents are fleeing on the Israeli side, too.On Friday the Israeli military said it was evacuating people from the northern city of Kiryat Shmona, which has about 20,000 residents. It has been hit by rocket fire in recent days. Days earlier it announced the evacuation of 28 communities and created a no-go zone within 2km of the border. Tensions in Lebanon rose further on Tuesday, after an explosion at a hospital in Gaza. Israel was immediately blamed by Hamas, but the Israeli military said the blast was caused by a misfired Palestinian militant rocket. Hezbollah, however, described it as a "massacre" by Israel and, in Beirut, hundreds of its followers protested, chanting anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans. But it was a small demonstration for what the group had described as an "unprecedented day of anger".A source familiar with Hezbollah's thinking, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the group's actions would be determined by what happens in Gaza. "If the Israelis invade [the territory]," the source said, "this will lead to a regional catastrophe".Some believe the decision about what to do next will likely come from Hezbollah's main backer, Iran. Israel accused Tehran of ordering Hezbollah to carry out a series of attacks on its territory last weekend. Tehran, meanwhile, warned that the "resistance front", its alliance of forces in the region with groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, could carry out a "pre-emptive action".Before the latest outbreak of violence, the consensus among observers was that neither Israel nor Hezbollah were interested in another war, as many still remember the devastating month-long conflict they fought in 2006. Lebanon is suffering from an economic crisis dating back years, and political infighting has left the country without a functioning government or president, while sectarian divisions have been exacerbated.To the west of Bint Jbeil, in the border village of Dhayra, Israeli retaliatory strikes hit the local mosque and some houses last week. Sabrina Fanash, a 36-year-old resident who moved to Beirut after the war started, was vocal in her criticism of militants who, she said, were using her Sunni-majority village for their attacks."It's not fair that our houses are like that. Who will rebuild them?" she said, walking through the rubble of her cousin's partially destroyed home. "All of us are sad… We depend on God, God will protect us."	
20/10/2023 03:40:00	Biden seeks 'vital' war aid for Israel and Ukraine - BBC News	US President Joe Biden has said world history is at "an inflection point" as he made the case for billions of dollars in wartime aid for Ukraine and Israel.In a speech at the White House, he said Hamas and Russia both wanted to "annihilate a neighbouring democracy".Mr Biden said he would send an urgent funding request - expected to be $105bn (£87bn) - to Congress on Friday.But the House of Representatives has no leader and can't approve any spending.Mr Biden's rare primetime address to the nation from the Oval Office on Thursday evening was just the second of his presidency.It came a day after his whirlwind trip to Israel following the attacks by Hamas on 7 October.Mr Biden said the emergency aid request would "pay dividends for American security for generations".In his 15-minute address, he also condemned any acts of hatred against Jews or Muslims in the US, and condemned the fatal stabbing of six-year-old Palestinian-American Wadea al-Fayoume in Chicago this week. "We must without equivocation denounce anti-Semitism," he said. "We must also without equivocation denounce Islamophobia."The White House has not yet officially released details about the expected aid package. But a source familiar with the request told the BBC's US partner CBS News it would include:Mr Biden also took great care to stress his sympathy for the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza, as well as talking about meeting the families of Israeli and US victims of the Hamas attacks.Democrats hope that by tying the different aid packages together they can win support for the Ukraine funding, which some Republicans oppose.But the request will arrive at an effectively frozen Congress, as House Republicans have been unable to elect a Speaker after Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a right-wing revolt more than two weeks ago. Mr Biden, who is a Democrat, did not explicitly address the political dysfunction, though he acknowledged "divisions at home"."We have to get past them," he said. "We can't let petty, partisan, angry politics get in the way of our responsibility as a great nation. "We cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win. I refuse to let that happen." But it is unclear if the spending package would pass Congress, even with a House Speaker.The Republican leader of the Senate has indicated willingness to take up the measure, but there is opposition within the party.Eight Republicans, led by Kansas Senator Roger Marshall, wrote in a letter: "These are two separate and unrelated conflicts and it would be wrong to leverage support of aid to Israel in an attempt to get additional aid for Ukraine across the finish line."Ohio Republican Senator JD Vance called Mr Biden's linking of the two conflicts "disgusting"."He's using dead children in Israel to sell his disastrous Ukraine policy," he posted on X, formerly Twitter, after the speech. There was even a sign of dissent within the Biden administration on Thursday as a state department official resigned in protest at the US decision to keep sending weapons to Israel as it lays siege to Gaza.Josh Paul, who headed the bureau that oversees arms transfers, told the BBC after quitting that he believed Israel's actions violated US legal provisions meant to restrict weapons sales to human rights abusers."I think our mechanisms for determining violations are broken," he said.Additional reporting by Phil McCausland and Max Matza	
20/10/2023 03:37:00	Israeli community frozen as Hamas atrocities continue to emerge - BBC News	They are still finding bodies in the neighbourhoods near Gaza.Warning: Some readers may find details in this article distressing.Recovery teams on Wednesday pulled a woman's body from the rubble in Kibbutz Be'eri. She was naked, her feet bound with metal wire.One of the team said the bodies of more than 20 children had been found nearby, tied together and burned.Even experienced workers are struggling: deaths like this are enough to break the living.In Nir Oz, a line of ambulances and black vans processed slowly past the fence as we entered the kibbutz. This is now a place of stillness, the community frozen in the chaos of the attack.Cats provide the only movement - sliding between bright toys strewn across gardens, the collapsed roofs, the charred gaping skeletons of people's homes.Overhead, loud explosions regularly fill the silence. Gaza is only three miles away.Hamas gunmen attacked early in Nir Oz. Survivors say one in four people are dead or missing, including a British man, Danny Darlington.He was born and raised in Manchester, before recently moving to Germany, and had been visiting family in the kibbutz.A neighbour identified Danny's body on the morning after the attack, but the family are still waiting for official confirmation that he is dead.Danny was not meant to be in the kibbutz that morning. His half-brother, Lior Peri, was expecting him back in Tel Aviv the day before, but Danny decided to stay on an extra night.Lior received a text message on Saturday morning, as the attack unfolded, saying: "S**t, big balagan [chaos] in the kibbutz.""That's the last I heard from him," Lior told me. "Now I'm trying to help the family in Manchester. They are really in the dark."Lior's father, Haim Peri, also went missing from Nir Or during the attack. Haim used to drive sick children from Gaza to Israeli hospitals. Some of the artwork he loved to collect is still standing amid the debris scattered through the house and garden.Haim and his wife, Osnat, were hiding in their safe room when Hamas gunmen first broke in. The door to the safe room held fast, but the gunmen returned with reinforcements.  This time, Lior says, Haim told his wife to hide behind the sofa in the safe room, then opened the door and gave himself up.His wife was still hiding when a second group of people burst in - less disciplined, more destructive. They ransacked the house. The door to the safe room was still open, but it was dark inside and they did not bother to look.Haim has now been formally listed as a hostage.There is frustration from many families here at the slow pace of information about the dead and missing.Tent cities lit by floodlights have sprung up at army bases to identify the dead. Plastic-robed medics work to a constant soundtrack of generators, fighter planes and cicadas.At one centre, we were shown more than a dozen shipping containers, their shelves stacked with body bags of all different sizes.  Staff say the remains of around 1,000 people have passed through here - some in the care of Captain Maayan. Army regulations mean she cannot give her last name."I didn't see one body that was shot just once," she told me. "In each body, I saw abuses and torture, and so many cuts, so many gunshots, so many bruises to the head and to the limbs. It doesn't feel like we're in war and we're seeing casualties. It feels like we're in a massacre, and we're looking at a massacre."It took nine hours for the army to arrive in Nir Oz. With hundreds of thousands of troops now ranged along the border, Israel is eyeing the next stage of this war - a major offensive operation inside Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas.Lior Peri feels out of sync with Israel's current national mood."Revenge is a very strong emotion, which a lot of people have now," he says. "But if they will hear us, hear the families, maybe they will reconsider. Maybe they will say: we will have time for revenge later on but before winning the war, let's do whatever we can to get out of this hostage situation."The families of Israel's hostages and missing are still frozen in the hours after the attack, left without answers, and caught between two different traumas: their nation's and their own. 	
21/10/2023 01:00:00	Israel says it will increase Gaza strikes, telling more people to flee south - BBC News		
19/10/2023 22:34:00	The world is losing its humanity, UNRWA chief says - BBC News	The Middle East is on the "edge of an abyss" as a result of the war between Israel and Hamas, UN agency chief Philippe Lazzarini has told the BBC.The commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA said violence could spill over across the region.And he warned about the dire situation for civilians inside Gaza, calling again for humanitarian aid corridors into the territory.Mr Lazzarini said he fears "the world is now losing its humanity".In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Mr Lazzarini reiterated calls for humanitarian aid corridors, saying help "needs to be uninterrupted... predictable [and] meaningful" to help the people of Gaza.Speaking in Jerusalem, the head of UNRWA condemned Hamas's attack on Israel, calling it a "horrific and barbaric massacre" that had created a "national trauma, a collective trauma in Israel". "But this event still does not justify that the war is conducted without any restraint," he said. "And I do not believe that killing even more civilians is in the interest of the future security and peace here in the region."Asked if Israelis were respecting international humanitarian law, Mr Lazzarini said: "Listen, we are now in a situation where there is a total siege being imposed in the Gaza Strip. "We are in a situation where more than a million people have been asked to be displaced. So this amounts to collective punishment, and collective punishment is a violation of international humanitarian law."He added: "We call to the Israelis and to anyone relevant in this conflict to respect international humanitarian law. There is no exception for anyone."Speaking about the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Mr Lazzarini said 2.2 million Palestinians, half of whom have been displaced, are "basically lacking everything"."There is no water. You have four toilets for 4,000 people. They are living on the floor," he said. "We are on the brink.""If there is no water anymore in the Gaza Strip, things will accelerate. And the disaster which is already unfolding under our eyes, will become even worse," Mr Lazzarini said.The UN has previously warned of a "humanitarian catastrophe" unless aid can get into Gaza.Mr Lazzarini said that before Hamas's attack on 7 October, around 500 trucks a day would carry aid, fuel and other goods into the Strip.Now, he said, it is unclear how much aid they need to send or what they will even be allowed to take in - but estimated the agency would need "at least 100 trucks a day" for Gazans. On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that his country would "not thwart" supplies going from Egypt to the civilian population in southern Gaza.However, no aid has yet has crossed into the territory via the Rafah crossing from Egypt. World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Thursday: "Our trucks are loaded and ready to go." He said supplies would be delivered as soon as the Rafah crossing opened - "hopefully tomorrow", he added.Mr Lazzarini ended by saying that Palestinians are now feeling "a deep sense and feeling of abandonment from the international community" amid the ongoing violence. "They feel completely empty. They all have families member who have been killed on a daily basis. They hear about the relatives. And at the same time, they have to care of their own survival.""But the feeling of abandonment should not be underestimated."	
19/10/2023 21:16:00	Rishi Sunak calls for stability after backing Israel against Hamas - BBC News	Rishi Sunak has urged Saudi Arabia to help support stability in the Middle East, after backing Israel in its war with Hamas on a visit to the country.The UK prime minister agreed to work with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to avoid further escalation and deliver aid to Gaza.Mr Sunak flew to Riyadh as part of a two-day trip to capitals in the region.Earlier, Mr Sunak promised to stand with Israel in a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The diplomatic flurry comes as Israel prepares for a ground invasion into Gaza after the deadly Hamas attack on 7 October.Speaking at a joint press conference with Mr Netanyahu, Mr Sunak said he was "proud" to support Israel in its "long war" against Hamas, which he branded "pure evil"."We will stand with you in solidarity, we will stand with your people. And we also want you to win," Mr Sunak told reporters.In a statement following the meeting with the Saudi crown prince, Downing Street said the pair agreed the "loss of innocent lives in Israel and Gaza over the last two weeks has been horrific" and "underscored the need to avoid any further escalation in the region".Mr Sunak "encouraged the crown prince to use Saudi's leadership in the region to support stability, both now and in the long-term", No 10 said.Israeli warplanes and artillery have been bombarding Gaza since more than 1,400 people were killed in the attack by Hamas earlier this month.Gaza remains under siege, with Israel blocking cross-border supplies of water, electricity, and fuel.Downing Street said Mr Sunak had met his Israeli counterpart for two hours of talks, mostly without officials present. Appearing afterwards, Mr Netanyahu said Israel would need "continued support" from allies, warning there would be "ups and downs" and "difficulties" as it fought Hamas.Speaking alongside him, Mr Sunak told reporters the UK "absolutely" supported Israel's "right to defend itself, in line with international law"."I know that you are taking every precaution to avoid harming civilians, in direct contrast to the terrorists of Hamas," he added.Borrowing a phrase from Britain's leader during World War Two, Sir Winston Churchill, Mr Netanyahu said the Hamas attack represented "the world's darkest hour".Mr Sunak echoed the language, adding: "I'm proud to stand here with you in Israel's darkest hour as your friend".His visit comes directly after US President Biden's, as world leaders step up efforts to prevent the conflict spilling into the wider region.Mr Biden said Israel had been "badly victimised" - and had a right to strike back against Hamas.But he cautioned Israelis against being "consumed" by anger, urging them not to repeat the "mistakes" made by an "enraged" United States after the 9/11 attacks in 2001.Mr Sunak's meeting with Saudi Arabia's crown prince is significant.Saudi Arabia is a vital player when it comes to engaging with all international and regional parties to halt escalation and prevent further spread in the region.Until a couple of weeks ago, Riyadh was involved in three-way negotiations with Tel Aviv and the White House to normalise relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. The talks were moving at a swift pace but all that changed on 7 October after Hamas's attack.Since then, Saudi Arabia has not only come out in strong support of the Palestinians but has also condemned and blamed Israel for the war.The Palestinian issue has united the otherwise divided Muslim world. Given the volatile dynamics of the region, Prince Salman could play an important role.Mr Sunak also said he appreciated Israel's announcement on Wednesday it would not stop aid entering southern Gaza from Egypt.However, Israel only agreed to allow food, water and medical supplies - not other much-needed supplies like fuel.It also says it will not allow any aid to pass through its own territory until hostages taken by Hamas during its attack earlier this month are released. After an earlier meeting with Israel's president Isaac Herzog, No 10 said Mr Sunak hoped for "further progress" in delivering aid to Gaza.Mr Sunak has declined to back calls from the Scottish National Party and some Labour MPs for a ceasefire to protect civilians, insisting Israel has a right to "act against terrorism".Speaking to broadcasters, however, he said it was important to stop the conflict escalating regionally.Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told MPs on Wednesday that calls for ceasefires were "all well and good", but he had seen no evidence that one would be respected by Hamas.Mr Cleverly is on a diplomatic trip of his own, meeting his Egyptian counterpart earlier. He is also due to visit Turkey and Qatar.	
19/10/2023 18:42:00	Gaza hospital: What video, pictures and other evidence tell us about Al-Ahli hospital blast - BBC News	A deadly blast at the crowded Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City is feared to have killed hundreds of people.The Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities in Gaza immediately blamed Israel, claiming it was a deliberate air strike. Israel has denied involvement.Amid the claim and counterclaim, getting to the truth is harder than ever. BBC Verify is trying to unravel what is and isn't known - looking at video footage, still imagery and other evidence, including eyewitness accounts. In addition, a BBC journalist has been to the blast site, where there is limited access. New information is emerging all the time, so we will continue to investigate and report our findings as we learn more and talk to experts about the evidence.It is also important to note that as well as the physical fighting, this conflict is playing out as an information war. This is not the first time authorities in Israel and Gaza have given completely different accounts of an explosion. We are also looking at their various claims and statements. The explosion at the hospital happened at around 19:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on Tuesday. A 20-second video which circulated on social media purporting to show the blast was the first significant piece of visual evidence to emerge of the incident.In it, you can hear the whistling sound of an incoming projectile, followed by an explosion and a huge fire. Live footage from the Al-Jazeera media network aired at 18:59 local time showed a bright light rising in the skies above Gaza. It flashes twice before drastically changing direction, and it then explodes. An explosion is then seen on the ground far away, followed by a much larger explosion closer to the camera, which the BBC has geolocated.  Some commentators have suggested it is from a rocket which appears to explode or disintegrate.Other footage which surfaced on social media channels showed what appears to be the same blast from different angles and distances.We contacted 20 think tanks, universities and companies with weapons expertise. Nine of them are yet to respond, five would not comment, but we spoke to experts at the remaining six. We asked whether the available evidence - including the size of the explosion and the sounds heard beforehand - could be used to determine the cause of the hospital blast. So far, the findings are inconclusive. Three experts we spoke to say it is not consistent with what you would expect from a typical Israeli air strike with a large munition. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University, in the US, says the ground explosions appeared to be small, meaning that the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.Justin Bronk, senior research fellow at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute, agrees. While it is difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he says, the evidence looks like the explosion was caused by a failed rocket section hitting the car park and causing a fuel and propellant fire.Mr Gannon says it is not possible to determine whether the projectile struck its intended target from the footage he has seen. He adds that the flashes in the sky likely indicate the projectile was a rocket with an engine that overheated and stopped working.Valeria Scuto, lead Middle East analyst at Sibylline, a risk assessment company, notes that Israel has the capacity to carry out other forms of air strike by drone, where they might use Hellfire missiles. These missiles generate a significant amount of heat but would not necessarily leave a large crater. But she says uncorroborated footage shows a pattern of fires at the hospital site that was not consistent with this explanation.The BBC was able to match details of buildings and the layout of the Al-Ahli hospital site with publicly available satellite imagery, to establish the hospital was the scene of the blast.Based on available evidence, it appears the explosion happened in a courtyard which is part of the hospital site. Images of the ground after the blast do not show significant damage to surrounding hospital buildings. What the images do show are scorch marks and burnt-out cars.The hospital is owned and run by the Anglican Church. Canon Richard Sewell, the dean of St George's College in Jerusalem, told the BBC that about 1,000 displaced people were sheltering in the courtyard when it was hit, and about 600 patients and staff were inside the building. Images posted online suggest the hospital had previously been hit. A Facebook post from 14 October shows damage to a room which is believed to be Al-Ahli Hospital's Diagnostic Cancer Treatment Centre. We have asked the IDF if they had hit the hospital and are awaiting a response.BBC reporter Rushdi Abualouf has been to the the Al-Ahli Hospital. Witnesses there report scenes of devastation, and say bodies are still being collected.One man told him that women, children and elderly people were at the hospital when the explosion happened.We are still analysing images and footage of the victims to determine what they can tell us about the blast from the nature of their injuries.The BBC has viewed extremely graphic images of victims and survivors at the explosion site, which show catastrophic injuries.Pathologist Derrick Pounder, a founder member of Physicians for Human Rights in the UK and an expert in the field of conflict injuries, viewed some of the images. "The overall pattern of scattered injuries is what would be expected from shrapnel resulting from an explosion," he said. But he also said it was not possible to clearly make out all of the injuries in the limited number of verified images available.The Palestinian health ministry said on Wednesday 471 people were killed in the blast. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said this number has been deliberately inflated, but has not released its own assessment of how many died. Because of lack of access to the site for independent organisations, it is difficult to verify the number killed.One of the most critical pieces of evidence is the nature of the crater left behind by the explosion.The IDF say that the absence of a large crater, or blast damage to adjacent buildings, proves that the explosion was not caused by its weapons. In the image below, you can see one small crater. Some have suggested that the lack of a large crater could be explained by the use of an "air burst" munition - a weapon set to explode above the ground. But the experts we spoke to said the blast scene was not consistent with this. Another important part of missing evidence is missile fragments. Projectiles are often identifiable by the wreckage of their shell, and they can be used to determine the projectile's origin. But in this case, we have not seen that evidence.The IDF has released a recording of what it says is an intercepted conversation between two Hamas militants acknowledging the hospital was hit by a projectile fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). PIJ is the second-largest militant group in Gaza, and supported Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.It is not possible to independently verify this recording. In a statement, PIJ denied any involvement and blamed Israel for the blast.There appeared to be an inconsistency in the Israeli briefing regarding where the rocket they believed caused the blast was fired from. The spokesman said it had been fired from a nearby cemetery - and there is a cemetery next to the hospital. But a map displayed by the spokesman showed a launch site further away. We have not been able to locate a cemetery there.Additional reporting by: The Visual Journalism team, Tom Spencer, Shayan Sardarizadeh, Jake Horton, Emma Pengelly and Jamie RyanUpdate, 26 October: This article has been updated to include the following link to further analysis of the blastWhy Is There a War?In-depth analysis from Frank Gardner looking at what started the war between Israel and Hamas.

19/10/2023 17:12:00	Mahsa Amini awarded EU's Sakharov human rights prize - BBC News	The European Union has awarded its top human rights prize to Mahsa Amini and the Iranian "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement her death triggered. The 22-year-old died in custody after allegedly violating the strict Iranian hijab (headscarf) rule for women. Her death sparked protests that presented the most serious challenge to the Iranian authorities in decades. The annual Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought recognises human rights activists and dissidents.After announcing Ms Amini's win, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said the day of her death would live in infamy. "The brutal murder of 22-year-old Jina Mahsa Amini marked a turning point. It has triggered a women-led movement that is making history," Ms Metsola said.  Iranian-Kurdish Mahsa Amini was visiting Tehran last year when she was arrested by the morality police for allegedly breaching Iran's strict Islamic dress code for women.Her death generated a global movement known as "Woman, Life, Freedom," calling for an end to Iran's imposition of a headscarf on all women and other discriminatory laws.Ms Amini's family and supporters said that she was killed, but Iranian authorities claim she died of a previously undisclosed medical condition. The authorities brutally cracked down on the protests, which led to the EU imposing sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for human rights violations in Iran last year. The Sakharov Prize goes further, sending a strong message of solidarity. "The world has heard the chants of 'Women, Life, Liberty'. Three words that have become a rallying cry for all those standing up for equality, for dignity and for freedom in Iran," Roberta Metsola said,  "We stand with those who, even from prison, continue to keep Women, Life and Freedom alive."The award comes two weeks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to an imprisoned Iranian rights campaigner, Narges Mohammadi, who has been fighting against the mandatory headscarf and the oppression of women in Iran.Last year, the Sakharov Prize - given annually in memory of Soviet scientist and dissident Andrei Sakharov - was awarded to the Ukrainian people for "protecting democracy, freedom and rule of law", following Russia's full-scale invasion of their country. Ms Amini and the Iranian "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement join a distinguished list of previous winners, including Pakistani campaigner Malala Yousafzai and South Africa's Nelson Mandela. The award comes with a €50,000 (£43,500; $53,000) endowment, which will be presented in a European Parliament ceremony in December.  Last month, Iran's parliament passed a controversial bill that would increase prison terms and fines for women and girls who break its strict dress code.	
19/10/2023 16:44:00	Aid delivery waits to enter Gaza from Egypt at Rafah crossing - BBC News	About 20 trucks carrying much-needed aid may be allowed to enter Gaza in the coming days - bringing some relief to its 2.2 million residents.Israel cut electricity, most water and stopped food and medicine deliveries there following an attack by Hamas militants on 7 October.A deal allowing some supplies through Egypt's Rafah crossing has now been struck by the US and Egypt.But humanitarian organisations warn it will not be nearly enough."The UN has reported that a minimum of 100 trucks of humanitarian assistance are needed in order to support the millions of civilians living in Gaza", Shaina Low of the Norwegian Refugee Council told the BBC.The World Food Programme's Abeer Etefa said that the situation in the territory was becoming "very difficult". "Food and water supplies are running out. The bakeries - many of them have stopped functioning."Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA, told the BBC that about 500 trucks a day had been entering Gaza before the war started. Some 1.2 million people living in the territory already relied on food aid from UNRWA before 7 October. "Poverty is very, very high in the Gaza Strip. Already before the war the situation was desperate - now it is becoming tragic," said Juliette Touma, the UN body's spokeswoman in Amman.The agreement to deliver a limited amount of aid via the Rafah crossing was reached by US President Joe Biden and Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi on Wednesday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Wednesday that Israel would "not thwart" supplies going from Egypt to the civilian population in southern Gaza.However, his government only agreed to allow food, water and medical supplies - not other much-needed supplies like fuel.A UN report on Gaza said that fuel is a necessity, and a lack of it is contributing to the water crisis, as desalination plants and water pumps can no longer operate.Mr Lazzarini said that if fuel could not be delivered, many more trucks will be needed to carry in water. The aid agreement offers a glimmer of hope for millions inside Gaza. Prior to these negotiations, it had been unclear how any aid would reach civilians.However, Israel has said it will not allow any aid to pass through its own territory until hostages being held by Hamas are released and and aid has not yet crossed the Rafah crossing into Gaza.Speaking to the BBC's Newshour, Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said that was because the crossing had been subject to four aerial bombardments, and that there had been no authorisation for the safe passage of lorries and trucks into Gaza."I would hope there would be a determination as to why the crossing is being bombarded and by whom it's being bombarded", he said. The exact timeline on when aid will get to those who need it remains unclear. The road on the Rafah crossing requires repairs before any trucks are able to enter.On Wednesday, US President Joe Biden said the first trucks could start arriving in Gaza on Friday.But Mohsen Sarhan from the Egyptian Food Bank warned that time - as well as supplies - was running out. He said 120 lorries were ready to deliver aid and were waiting at the border for safe passage."We're very angry because we know people over there have run out of water. They have even run out of body bags. They have run out of everything."	
19/10/2023 12:03:00	Hundreds arrested at Israel-Gaza protest near US Capitol - BBC News	At least 300 people have been arrested near the US Capitol after a protest against the Israel-Hamas war.That number is likely to rise as more arrests are processed, police said, adding that three people were charged with assaulting a police officer. Most were arrested inside the Cannon House Office Building, where protests are not permitted. The demonstrators called on President Joe Biden and Congress to push for a ceasefire in Gaza.The rally in Washington DC was organised by two fringe left-wing Jewish campaign groups, Jewish Voice for Peace and If Not Now, which advocate against the State of Israel.Police closed streets around the Capitol complex on Wednesday, saying a large group of protesters were walking in the road.Some of the group then occupied part of the Cannon House Office Building, which is used by congressional staffers. Hundreds more gathered outside the building where they sang in both Hebrew and English.Those inside wore black T-shirts that read "Jews say ceasefire now" and "Not in our name". Others carried banners reading "Ceasefire" and sang songs while sitting on the floor in the rotunda."We warned the protesters to stop demonstrating and when they did not comply we began arresting them," the Capitol police force said on Wednesday afternoon.Some were seen being restrained with zip-ties and led away to police vans. Three of those arrested were later charged with assaulting a police officer.One protest organiser at the Capitol used a megaphone to call for "equality, justice and freedom". "The only way towards true safety… is to de-escalate, and address the root causes of this horrific violence," the woman said.The protest came on the same day that President Biden landed in Israel to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet.Mr Biden said during the visit that Israel had a right to hit back for the Hamas attack on 7 October that left 1,400 people dead.At least 3,000 people have been killed in retaliatory Israeli strikes on Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials.	
19/10/2023 03:29:00	Israel Gaza: Biden clinches deal with Egypt to allow aid - BBC News	US President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Egypt to deliver limited aid to Gaza to ease a humanitarian crisis amid the Israel-Hamas war.Visiting Tel Aviv, Mr Biden said Israel had a right to hit back for the Hamas attack that triggered the fighting.The US president said Israel had been "badly victimised", though he cautioned against being "consumed" by rage.He also backed Israel's account that a blast at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday was not caused by an Israeli air strike. Palestinian officials say the explosion at Gaza's Al-Ahli Arab Hospital killed 471 people, blaming it on Israel. The incident has further inflamed tensions across the region.But during a trip to Tel Aviv lasting fewer than eight hours on Wednesday, Mr Biden supported the Israeli claim that the deadly blast appeared to have been caused by a misfiring Palestinian rocket.The American president said he was "deeply saddened and outraged" by the explosion.Israel has pointed the finger at Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza. Islamic Jihad denied any role in the blast. The Palestinian-reported death toll has also been disputed by Israel. A foreign ministry spokesman, Lior Haiat, said on social media platform X that "several dozen people" had been "apparently killed".While flying home, Mr Biden discussed aid for Gaza with Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi by phone.Mr Biden told journalists that Mr Sisi had agreed to open the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza to allow about 20 lorries carrying humanitarian aid into the territory.Egypt confirmed its president and Mr Biden had agreed to provide aid to Gaza "in a sustainable manner". Mr Biden did not give a timeline for the border crossing opening, but White House spokesman John Kirby said it would occur in the coming days after road repairs.Mr Biden also said $100m (£82m) in US funding would be be allocated to support Palestinian civilians. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters news agency the US president was considering asking Congress for $10bn in aid for Israel as soon as Friday.People are desperately short of food, water, fuel, medicine and other essentials after Israel launched a blockade of the enclave 10 days ago.Israel struck back after the Palestinian militant group Hamas killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented incursion from Gaza on 7 October.At least 3,000 people have been killed in retaliatory Israeli strikes on Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials. More than a million Palestinians have fled their homes within Gaza - about half of the population.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed Israel would not prevent supplies going from Egypt to the civilian population in southern Gaza.However, Israel said it would not allow any aid to pass through its own territory until hostages being held by Hamas were released. Nearly 200 people have been abducted, Israel says.Mr Biden will give a televised address to the nation from the White House on Thursday at 20:00 EDT (midnight GMT). In his address, Mr Biden will "discuss our response to Hamas's terrorist attacks against Israel and Russia's ongoing brutal war against Ukraine", White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said.Also on Thursday, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is due to visit Israel.On the US president's high-stakes visit to Tel Aviv, he was warmly greeted by Mr Netanyahu, before the pair hosted a joint news conference. Mr Biden likened the Hamas raid on Israel to the 9/11 attacks in the US. "The scale may be different, but I'm sure those horrors have tapped into some kind of primal feeling in Israel, just like it did and felt in the United States," Mr Biden said. "But I caution this: while you feel that rage, don't be consumed by it."After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. And while we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes." Addressing the explosion at the hospital, Mr Biden told Mr Netanyahu: "Based on what I've seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you." Mr Biden was later asked by reporters what led him to conclude that Israel was not responsible, and said: "The data I was shown by my defence department."A senior American official has told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that Washington has its own intelligence - in addition to Israel's - that includes communications intercepts and satellite photos, which give it "high confidence" Israel was not behind the strike.The official said there were "indications" that it was an errant rocket fired by a group in Gaza.Mr Biden had planned to travel from Israel to Jordan to meet King Abdullah, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egypt's President Sisi, but that leg of the trip was called off after the hospital blast.Jordan cancelled the meeting and condemned what it called "a great calamity and a heinous war crime". The White House said the decision to call off that part of the visit had been "made in a mutual way". 	
18/10/2023 22:14:00	Jeremy Bowen: Joe Biden's search for a Middle East solution just got harder - BBC News	Even before the deadly blast at Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza, Joe Biden's full-throated support for Israel had convinced Palestinians and millions of other Arabs that the United States was more than simply Israel's most important supporter. They believed the Americans were also complicit in everything Israel was doing in Gaza, including killing children. The bitter dispute over who was responsible for the attack will not change many minds. Twelve days of war have ramped up hatred and division.   Israel produced a detailed rebuttal of accusations that it had attacked Al-Ahli. It displayed evidence that it said proved a missile fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad had malfunctioned and dropped well short of its target in Israel.  For Palestinians - not just supporters of Hamas - the piles of bloodstained body bags were all the proof they needed. For them, the difference at Al-Ahli was not of principle but of degree. Israel has been killing scores of Palestinians every day since it responded to the Hamas surprise attack, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reminded Mr Biden had killed at least 1,400 people, mostly Israeli civilians. Al-Ahli was, for Palestinians, more proof of Israel's disregard for their lives. The first reports of the destruction of the hospital emerged as the engines of Air Force One were warming up to bring Joe Biden to the Middle East. Before it could take off his schedule was in tatters. President Biden has a deep commitment to Israel. It must have seemed natural to him to fly into Tel Aviv to show his support and offer a public embrace to Mr Netanyahu. Mr Biden had been hoping somehow to balance that out at a hastily-arranged summit in Amman, the Jordanian capital, where he planned to meet the king of Jordan, the president of Egypt and the Palestinian president. But Jordan cancelled because of Al-Ahli. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, hurried back to his HQ in Ramallah on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Jordan itself released statements condemning Israel. The trip became much harder for President Biden. Heads of state usually only travel on diplomatic missions once the hard work of negotiation has been done and a deal is ready to be signed. Coming to Tel Aviv was a gamble for President Biden. He wanted to ease Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, while supporting Israel's war effort - perhaps an impossible circle to square with Mr Netanyahu. But a deal emerged from their meeting. Israel was promised more military aid. In return it agreed to let convoys carrying food, water and medicine enter southern Gaza from Egypt. Hospitals are desperate for fuel for their generators, but when the deal was announced it was not mentioned. Apart from supporting the Israelis and reminding them to observe the laws of war, Mr Biden also wants to reinforce the message that the war must not spread. He had already deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups to the eastern Mediterranean, to show Iran and its ally in Lebanon, the Hezbollah militia and political movement, that they would have the US to reckon with if they intervened.One reason why leaders inside and outside the Middle East are struggling with the renewed war between Hamas and Israel is because they are in unknown territory. The old certainties had become comforting assumptions. But now they are mostly shattered and gone. The Middle East looked to be familiar ground before the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October. A status quo existed. No leader in the region, and among its allies, liked it much but at the very least it seemed to promise stability.Most Palestinians were as surprised as anyone else when Hamas attacked. Some had criticised Hamas for supposedly forgetting that its name is an Arabic acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement.Mr Netanyahu has been condemned by his many political enemies in Israel for being asleep on the job when Hamas invaded, and for presiding over a catastrophic military and intelligence failure. Israelis thought their government could keep them safe.  Another illusion related directly to Mr Netanyahu was his assumption that the Palestinians could be managed without allowing them independence. Part of that involved making deals with Hamas over issues like the numbers of workers allowed back into Israel. At the same time, using a classic tactic of divide and rule, Mr Netanyahu worked to undermine the Palestinian Authority, the main rivals of Hamas for leadership of the Palestinians. The PA took part in years of ultimately fruitless peace talks, and recognised Israel a generation ago. But to get it talking again, Israel would have to discuss transferring land to the Palestinians for a future state with a capital in Jerusalem.  That idea is out of the question for Mr Netanyahu in his current incarnation as the leader of a government sustained by extreme religious nationalists. His record suggests he has never wanted to make those concessions. It was easier for him to find a way to insist Israel had no partner for peace. Mr Netanyahu, or a successor, will have to change their thinking if they want to find a way to save the next generation from more war. For leaders of the US's Arab allies, there has also been a sharp reminder that the Palestinians cannot be ignored. Jordan and Egypt have long-established peace treaties with Israel. The UAE normalised relations in the Abraham Accords. All were hoping to benefit from Joe Biden's plan to create a new Middle East, and a foreign policy achievement to boast about, by brokering a deal in which Israel and Saudi Arabia would recognise each other in return for security guarantees from the US. Mr Biden's officials thought they were making progress. Now a Saudi-Israeli rapprochement is way off the agenda.  And for Arab kings, princes and presidents, the war in Gaza and the attack on the hospital is also about the return of nightmares. At the end of 2010 a frustrated and furious market trader in Tunisia set himself on fire to protest against corrupt and bullying officials. It set off the Arab uprisings of 2011, which terrified leaders who thought they might lose everything - not just power and wealth but perhaps even their lives. If the death of an angry young man in Tunisia could be the spark for revolutions, what could be the price of a war that kills thousands of Palestinian civilians?  Certainties have been shown, in less than two weeks of bloodshed, to be built on sand. The new status quo will emerge from war. Perhaps the shock it creates will force new thinking. If it simply reinforces the old ways, the outlook is grim. Correction 19th October: This article originally said that Al-Ahli hospital has been destroyed and has been amended to clarify that the building was the site of a deadly explosion.Are you in the region?

18/10/2023 19:34:00	Inside an Israeli 'war room' on the volatile Lebanon border - BBC News	They call it "Hamal" - short for "war room" in Hebrew. It sits high in the mountains on the Israel-Lebanon border, at the heart of a complex protected by blast walls. Everything here is about security. There are no windows, and before you can pass through the solid door you have to leave behind mobile phones and smart watches - anything that could give away this secret location. Inside are banks of monitors. Right around the clock, a team of soldiers are gazing at them intently.  Each shows grainy black-and-white images from cameras that are constantly trained on more than 100km (62 miles) of Lebanese border. Shifts are normally four hours long, watching the pictures cycle over and over and looking for anything usual.Since Palestinian Hamas militants attacked southern Israel from Gaza 11 days ago, killing 1,400 people and taking 199 others hostage, there has been a steady increase in tensions on this border. Almost every day Hezbollah militants from Lebanon have launched anti-tank missiles into Israel, and Israeli forces have responded with artillery, fighter jets and attack helicopters.Both sides have seen civilian deaths this week. Each engagement raises fears that the violence on this border could quickly spiral out of control. Captain "S" commands the all-female company watching the cameras. This surveillance job is exclusively done by women. "We are the eyes of the soldiers, the eyes of the forces in the field - of the entire border." she tells me, "and we are playing a very important role." Along one side of the room, childhood photos of each soldier are strung along the wall like bunting. Their dates of birth are written in thick black pen underneath. Each is young, most are still completing their period of compulsory military service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)."We are strong women, female soldiers that know their job and mission and know that we play a very important role in this war."Our goal is first of all to defend, and all the girls know it. Each soldier comes to her shift vigilant and knows her part."On several occasions over the past week, militants have tried to get across the wall. Hezbollah, a powerful Lebanese military and political group backed by Iran, has gradually increased its efforts to infiltrate Israel. Like its staunch ally Hamas, it has been designated a terrorist organisation by the US, UK and others. There are real concerns internationally that any miscalculations here could lead to a new northern front opening up in this war. A major event - like the hospital explosion in Gaza, or the start of a ground offensive there by Israel - could also trigger Hezbollah to take more significant action towards Israel.At some moments, it feels very close. Sergeant "I" was on duty, watching her monitor, when the images on it suddenly changed. As shadowy figures approached the border wall, she knew what to do. Quickly, she called in an air strike. "I recognised a group of terrorists on the screens and understood that something was wrong. This is my job, to protect the northern border so that no one will penetrate and no civilians will get hurt, especially those who live here by the border." "It's scary, and it's stressful, but I have to keep it cool. I won't lie, it's very scary to stand here by the border. With everything that's happening nowadays in our country, it's very difficult to process all that's happened."For Sergeant "I", it's especially difficult. Young female soldiers doing exactly the same job in the south were targeted by Hamas.  "I think of all the forces and the camera observers who were caught up in the attack there. My heart goes out to them. I personally know a lot of people who were abducted or murdered."	
18/10/2023 19:02:00	Panic and confusion at scene of Gaza hospital blast - BBC News	Palestinian health officials now say that at least 471 people were killed by an explosion at a hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday night. They blame an Israeli air strike, but Israel's military says the blast was caused by a failed rocket launch by the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf visited the scene and found that body parts are still being collected.Blood-soaked mattresses are strewn across the courtyard of the Al-Ahli Arab hospital, along with clothing and personal possessions left behind in the chaos that followed the blast and the huge fire it caused.In a nearby car park lie the smouldering wrecks of more than a dozen cars.The surrounding buildings are also damaged, apparently pockmarked by shrapnel. But no large impact crater is visible. There is an atmosphere of panic, with people struggling to understand what happened at a place that was supposed to be protected under international humanitarian law."We left our home to come here," a woman who survived the explosion told the BBC. "We thought it would be safe, but then it got bombed."Doctors said that most of the victims were among the several thousand civilians who had been sheltering at the hospital since Friday. They fled there after the Israeli military told civilians to evacuate the north of the Gaza Strip, as it stepped up its air strikes on militant group Hamas.Many staying inside the courtyard were elderly or infirm, unable to leave for the south because they did not have access to transport.One witness told me that they had been sitting on the ground when it was rocked by a huge blast.People from all around the Gaza Strip soon arrived at the scene to try to help, he said. They collected bodies and began evacuating injured people. Those in a serious condition were taken away on motorbikes, while those less hurt had to make their way on foot to Shifa hospital, 3km (two miles) away.A second man said he heard something just before the blast but did not know what it was. He explained that he returned to the hospital afterwards because there was no other option."Where else can we go? Are we leaving like in 1948?" he asked, referring to the first Arab-Israeli war, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced or fled from their homes.Despite their protected status, 20 hospitals in the north, including Al-Ahli Arab, have received orders to evacuate their patients and staff, according to the World Health Organization.The UN agency has said the orders are impossible to carry out, given the current insecurity, critical condition of many patients, lack of ambulances, and shortage of beds elsewhere, and warned that it will "further worsen the current humanitarian and public health catastrophe".	
18/10/2023 17:24:00	Alex Danzig: Fears grow for much-loved historian kidnapped by Hamas - BBC News	The killing of at least 1,400 people in Israel by Palestinian Hamas militants from Gaza and the taking of more than 100 hostages have reverberated around the world, notably in central and eastern Europe, with its strong Jewish connections and memories of the Holocaust.There, the taking of one man has caused particular distress and sorrow.Alex Danzig, a 75-year-old scholar and historian of the Holocaust, has spent the last 30 years working for Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust remembrance centre, educating Jews and Poles about what happened in the later years of World War Two.But he lives in Nir Oz, a kibbutz in southern Israel that is close to Gaza, and hasn't been seen or heard from by his family since 7 October, the day the attackers came.There's a bitter irony here. Though Alex was born in Poland after the war - in 1948, the same year as the creation of the State of Israel - his older sister Edith is a Holocaust survivor.Born in 1941 under German occupation in what is now western Ukraine, she was found a place of refuge by her parents with a Polish mother and daughter, Maria and Halina Assanowicz, who saved her from the Nazis.This humanitarian act also allowed Edith's parents to have more freedom of movement, despite the occupation and the persecution of Jews, and they later testified that they themselves owed their lives to the Assanowiczes. The pair were recognised by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations in 1982, the highest honour Israel can bestow on non-Jewish saviours of Jews in the Holocaust.So it would be no exaggeration to say that Alex Danzig also owed his existence to these people.Alex's early life was unremarkable. He spent his first nine years in Poland, and after his parents emigrated to Israel in 1957 he spent time in the military, fighting in several wars, joined a left-wing youth organisation, obtained a degree in history and started a family on the kibbutz.It was his return to Poland on a trip in 1986, and a visit to the site of Auschwitz - a death camp when the country was occupied by the Nazis - which fuelled his interest in the Holocaust, and in particular the complexity of Polish-Jewish relations. He spent the next few decades leading tours to the death camps, and educating Israeli and Polish students.Speaking to the BBC, his close friend and former colleague Orit Margilot - who worked with him on the Polish desk at Yad Vashem - describes him as "the most knowledgeable person I know".She paints a picture of a great communicator who knows how to speak to young people and can break down barriers - for instance with references to people's favourite football teams.She says his impact has been enormous."He knows how to open hearts to this topic [Polish-Jewish relations]. It's really not easy. It worked so well [in Poland] that they all became his friends.""He has thousands of students who adore and love him," his son Mati told the BBC. "He is an exceptional teacher - every time I've been in a lecture of him I was fascinated."But aside from his intellectual work, he also loves working on the land and alternates between lecturing and his home in the kibbutz. It was there that he disappeared when the Hamas attackers came.Mati, who also lives at Nir Oz but survived the attack with his family, is currently in the relative safety of the Red Sea resort of Eilat with other survivors. He described the terrible events of that day.He said they received an alert at 06:30 (03:30 GMT) which they thought was a rocket attack, not uncommon in that part of Israel.It was his father who first told him to check messages on a kibbutz chat, where people were messaging about what was really going on - that gunmen had entered the area.At first Mati thought the attackers were just ransacking people's homes but soon messages started appearing that people had been shot, and it became clear that they were killing or kidnapping whoever they could.Mati and his family spent eight hours fearing that they would be next."I look at my three daughters and I say that this is the last time that I will see them and it's a pity that these animals will take the lives of innocent children," he said. But the attackers never came for them."We were one of very few houses, maybe three or four houses, that they didn't get in, some kind of luck from God."Mati's mother, estranged from Alex but living in Nir Oz, also survived, he says, by bravely holding her door against the attackers. Two of Mati's siblings and their children also somehow escaped the carnage.Alex Danzig was not so lucky."My brother Yuval spoke to him about 08:30, and this was the last time we made connection with him," Mati says."We know for sure he was kidnapped, there was no doubt about it - along with 80 others from the Kibbutz - there was no evidence of them anywhere."He says everyone fears for Alex's safety. He has not been seen in any of the photos or videos released by Hamas since the kidnappings.The historian had a severe heart attack and surgery several years ago and needs medication, which he does not have with him."Every minute that goes by is dangerous for him," Mati says.His disappearance has triggered a campaign for his release, both in Israel and in Poland.The #StandwithAlex campaign is trying to put pressure on the Polish government to secure his release."Help us help him. We want him back," says a statement on the campaign's Facebook page."We want him returned safety, and all those innocents cruelly taken by Hamas to come home, safely."Ms Margilot spoke of her "real, truthful friendship" with Alex, a man who is a year older than her mother."There was never any ego, in a way we completed each other," she said, adding that he was always considerate towards her as an observant Jew, for instance making sure she had kosher food on trips abroad.Ms Margilot is currently making efforts to obtain his birth certificate from archives in Warsaw, in order to get written confirmation of his Polish citizenship.This was revoked in 1957 because of a technicality when he emigrated, though recently he has received awards from the Polish government only given to Polish citizens.Ms Margilot believes a citizenship document might be the key to his release."Sometimes if you have foreign citizenship it helps with Hamas," she says.Mati says he and his father have always been "very close", even though for many years they were physically far apart.Born on the kibbutz, Mati moved back with his family when his oldest daughter was three years old.Since then they have seen Alex at least three times a week.His son said that the day before the attack they had visited him for a family dinner, and he was very happy to see them."It was very lovely, the atmosphere was very nice," he said."And then the sky fell."	
18/10/2023 17:03:00	Manchester scientist trapped in Gaza fears being killed in air strikes - BBC News	A scientist trapped in Gaza has said he fears being killed by an Israeli air strike "every time he goes outside" to get food for his family. Mohammed Ghalayini, 44, who lives in Manchester, was visiting 15 Palestinian relatives when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,300 people.Israeli warplanes and artillery have since been bombarding Gaza in response.Mr Ghalayini and his family have had to move several times and they are now sheltering in Khan Yunis. More than 3,000 people have been reported killed in air strikes on Gaza.Israel has blocked fuel, water, food and medical supplies and is demanding the release of scores of hostages who were taken into Gaza by the Hamas militants.On Tuesday, hundreds of people were killed in an explosion at a crowded hospital in Gaza City. Palestinian officials said the blast was caused by an Israeli air strike.However, the Israeli military denied this and said it was the result of a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad - an accusation the militant group rejected.Mr Ghalayini, who is sheltering 15 miles from the hospital, described the incident as a "massacre".The air quality scientist said: "We were appalled by the attack, the massacre at the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital. "My father used to work there delivering babies and we have absolutely no doubt that this massacre was due to an Israeli strike."Where is international humanitarian law?"Mr Ghalayini had returned to his hometown of Gaza City in September, intending to stay for three months. He was on a career break, he said, and had wanted to reconnect with his father and half-brothers. But now he and his family are trapped in a flat and are finding it difficult to remain hopeful. "We're really, really struggling in this situation," he said."I'm struggling to sleep, we're not eating enough and we're kind of running around the streets trying to get stuff and wondering where the next bomb will fall."Mr Ghalayini told BBC North West Tonight how, just a few hours earlier, he narrowly escaped the bombing of a market 200 yards from where he is sheltering. "According to people running away, one of the bombs hit a place that had already been hit so it probably hit people offering assistance," he said. He called for a ceasefire, adding: "We need this Israeli attack on Palestinians to stop. "The attack needs to stop and then the international community needs to facilitate a long, just and lasting peace."Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was asked earlier if he would join the calls for an immediate ceasefire to protect civilians in Israel and Gaza.In response, the prime minister said Israel had "a right to defend itself"."We believe that Israel does have a right to defend itself, to protect its people, and to act against terrorism and ensure that the awful attack that we've seen from Hamas cannot happen again," he told MPs."Unlike Hamas, the Israelis, including the president, have made it clear that their armed forces will operate in accordance with international law."And we will continue to urge the Israelis to take every precaution to avoid harming civilians."Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

18/10/2023 15:57:00	Pause for thought - Israel’s calculations before going into Gaza - BBC News	For days now, Israel has signalled that its massed forces are poised to go into Gaza with the aim of eliminating Hamas as a military force once and for all, following its raid into southern Israel on 7 October.Over 300,000 reservists have been called up for the IDF (Israel Defence Forces). The farms, fields and kibbutzim on the Israeli side of the Gaza border are crowded with Merkava tanks, self-propelled artillery systems and thousands of heavily armed infantry in full battle dress.The Israeli Air Force and Navy have been pounding every suspected Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad hideout and weapons store in Gaza, killing and wounding large numbers of civilians in the process, as well as a small number of Hamas commanders.The massive number of casualties caused by Tuesday's explosion at a central Gaza hospital, blamed and denied by both sides, will only have inflamed tensions in the region even further.  So why hasn't Israel begun its promised incursion into Gaza?There are several factors involved here.The hurriedly-planned visit of President Joe Biden to Israel this week is an indication of how worried the White House is about the deteriorating situation. Washington has two big concerns: the escalating humanitarian crisis and the risk of this conflict spreading across the Middle East.The US president has already made clear his opposition to any Israeli return to an occupation of Gaza, which it withdrew from in 2005. This, he said, would be "a big mistake". Officially he has been visiting Israel to show strategic support for America's closest Middle East ally and to hear of Israel's plans for Gaza.Unofficially, he is likely to be urging some restraint on the hardline government of Benjamin Netanyahu. The US would like to know how, if Israel goes into Gaza, it plans to get out, and when.Any prospect of Israel launching a full-scale military invasion of Gaza while Airforce One is sitting parked on the tarmac in Tel Aviv would not be a good look, for either the US or Israel.In a visit overshadowed by the deadly blast at Gaza's Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, President Biden publicly backed Israel's version of events, that a mis-fired Palestinian rocket caused the explosion. Palestinian officials say an Israeli air strike hit the hospital. The BBC is working to independently verify the death toll, which is feared to be in the hundreds, as well as the cause of the explosion.In the last few days, Iran has issued stern warnings that Israel's assault on Gaza cannot go unanswered. So what does that mean in practice?Iran funds, trains, arms and to some extent controls a number of Shi'a militias in the Middle East. By far the most potent of these is Hezbollah in Lebanon, sitting just across from Israel's northern border. The two countries fought a damaging and inconclusive war in 2006 which saw Israel's modern battle tanks knocked out by hidden mines and well-planned ambushes. Since then, Hezbollah has rearmed with Iranian help and is now thought to have close to 150,000 rockets and missiles, many of which are long-range and precision-guided.There is an implicit threat here that if Israel invades Gaza then Hezbollah may open up a new front on Israel's northern border, forcing it to fight a war on two fronts. It is by no means certain, however, that Hezbollah wants this war at this time, especially with two US Navy carrier strike groups sailing just offshore in the eastern Mediterranean and ready to come to Israel's aid.This will give Israel some reassurance that any attack by Hezbollah could potentially invoke a devastating retaliation from US naval air power. It is worth remembering though that at the start of Israel's last war with Hezbollah in 2006 the militants were able to hit an Israeli warship offshore with one of their sophisticated anti-ship missiles.The Israeli government's concept of a humanitarian crisis tends to lag behind the rest of the world's when it comes to rooting out Hamas from Gaza. As the death toll amongst Palestinian civilians mounts as a result of relentless Israeli airstrikes, much of the global sympathy for Israel after the barbaric and bloodthirsty actions of Hamas on 7 October has been replaced by a rising clamour to stop the air strikes and protect ordinary Gazans.If and when Israeli ground forces go into Gaza in strength, then the death toll will only rise further. Israeli soldiers will die too, from ambushes, snipers and booby traps - much of the fighting may even take place below ground, in miles of tunnels. But it is likely that, once again, it will be the civilian population that will bear the brunt of the casualties.Israeli intelligence has had a bad month. Shin Bet, the domestic intelligence agency, has taken the rap for the failure to spot Hamas's initial deadly attack coming. It is supposed to have a network of informants and spies inside Gaza, keeping tabs on commanders from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Yet what happened on that horrific Saturday morning in southern Israel amounted to the worst intelligence failure in the nation's history since the Yom Kippur war in 1973.Israeli intelligence will have been frantically trying to make amends over the last 10 days, helping the IDF identify names and locations of hostages as well as where Hamas commanders are hiding. It is possible that they have asked for more time to gather more information so that if and when ground forces do go in, then they can head directly to a specific location, rather than wandering around the ruins and rubble of northern Gaza facing constant attack, amid rising condemnation from much of the world.Those elements of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad that are still operational after the sustained Israeli bombing campaign will have planned ambushes and traps for any advancing Israeli troops. These will be particularly hazardous in the underground tunnels. Israeli intelligence will be keen to discover their locations and warn the IDF accordingly.

"This is a massacre."He said he had been working every day until 1am in dire conditions, with children comprising 40% of the patients he has seen.He added that resources were running out fast with water pressure now insufficient to supply some of the equipment.Dr Abu-Sittah previously told the BBC how the Met Police turned up at his home in London to question his wife.He said that to have his family "harassed in this way is just bizarre".The Met Police said Dr Abu-Sittah's home was visited by officers because the force received a report that "a man was planning to travel to a warzone".Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

18/10/2023 02:05:00	Israel Gaza: Biden's visit is a high-stakes gamble - BBC News	For an American president, turning up in a warzone is an extraordinary move.Joe Biden's trip to the Middle East on Wednesday was always going to be a high-stakes gamble. But he is now flying into an even more volatile situation, after the bombing of a hospital in Gaza that is thought to have killed hundreds of Palestinians.  Hamas has blamed an Israeli air strike, but Israel said the blast at Al Ahli hospital was caused by rockets fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Mr Biden had planned to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv and Arab leaders in Jordan.But just before Air Force One took off from Joint Base Andrews, the summit in Amman was suddenly cancelled. President Biden will have wanted to look like an honest broker dealing with both sides in the Middle East.  He now faces the embarrassment of being told by the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority that they have no confidence in his ability to end the violence, which they say is in breach of international law.  There is no doubt whose side President Biden is on when it comes to the conflict between Israel and Hamas.  The president described the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October - which left more than 1,400 Israelis dead - as "sheer evil", and said the country had a right and a duty to defend itself.  His hastily organised visit is designed to further demonstrate America's firm solidarity with the Jewish state.  But he is having to balance his support for Israel's aim of destroying Hamas with his deep concerns about the civilian and humanitarian cost.  And while he has publicly warned of the need to operate by the "rules of war", the message he delivers behind closed doors could be more stern. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the US and Israel stood for the rule of law, "unlike Hamas". "This is a foundational element of the discussions we've had with the Israelis forever, and we will continue doing that," he said.The US wants Israel to allow aid into Gaza, and for it to allow safe passage for trapped Americans in Gaza. After nearly eight hours of talks with Mr Netanyahu on Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had made good progress towards these goals, yet still nothing has been agreed.   President Biden is also crucially aware that global public sentiment could quickly change, and support for Israel might evaporate when overwhelmed by images of Palestinian casualties and suffering. There is also a very real fear that the more brutal the assault on Gaza, the greater the chance that it could trigger a wider conflict in the region with other countries getting involved.  Then there are inevitable security concerns. The apparatus that accompanies the president abroad is formidable at the best of times, and a short-notice trip to a conflict zone will be a considerable challenge. Mr Blinken and his entourage were forced to seek shelter in a bunker as air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv on Monday - that would be a difficult look for a president.  This could be one situation in which Mr Biden's age becomes an advantage not a problem. He has been visiting Israel for 50 years, and he has known Mr Netanyahu for 40 years, describing theirs as a "frank relationship". That will allow for a more robust exchange of views than those that can be shared between leaders who don't have that kind of personal history. President Biden has clear ideas about what he believes should and should not happen next. He thinks it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza. He has said there needs to be a Palestinian Authority and a path to a Palestinian state, even though there has been no progress towards Palestinian statehood for many years.  He will surely want to put the maximum pressure he can on Israel to operate more carefully in Gaza, and to end the conflict as quickly as possible. The US has consistently been Israel's most loyal and committed ally. Regardless of who is in the White House, there has always been broad support for the Jewish state and its right to exist in safety and security.  President Biden has for decades been one of the politicians most outspoken in his backing for Israel, saying in 1986 that "were there not an Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel to protect our interests in the region".Now it is time for the US president to use all the influence and leverage he has at his disposal to try to limit the bloodshed and loss of life, and prevent an all-out war across the Middle East. All while events on the ground are making it harder than ever.

18/10/2023 01:37:00	Hospital blast in Gaza City kills hundreds - health officials - BBC News	Hundreds of people have been killed by an explosion at a crowded hospital in Gaza City, health officials say.One doctor condemned what he called "a massacre" at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, while another spoke of a scene of total devastation. Palestinian officials say the blast was caused by an Israeli air strike. But the Israeli military say it was the result of a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad - an accusation the militant group rejected.Israeli warplanes and artillery have been bombarding Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October by the main Palestinian militant group, Hamas, which killed 1,400 people.More than 3,000 people have been reported killed by strikes on Gaza.The hospital blast is threatening efforts to resolve the humanitarian crisis there, with Jordan cancelling a planned summit on Wednesday between US President Joe Biden, King Abdullah and the Palestinian and Egyptian leaders.Mr Biden is still travelling to Tel Aviv to show his country's "solidarity with Israel" and "ironclad commitment to its security".Pictures that emerged from Al-Ahli Arab hospital on Tuesday night show scenes of chaos, with bloodied and maimed casualties being rushed out on stretchers in the darkness. Bodies and wrecked vehicles can be seen lying in the rubble-strewn street outside. One video appears to show a projectile hitting the area followed by a blast. "We were operating in the hospital, there was a strong explosion, and the ceiling fell on the operating room. This is a massacre," said Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a Médecins Sans Frontières plastic surgeon who had been helping to treat people wounded in the war.Another doctor told the BBC that 80% of the hospital had been taken out of service and estimated that 1,000 people had been killed or injured.The Ahli al-Arab hospital is fully funded by the Anglican Church, which says the facility is independent of any political factions in Gaza. Canon Richard Sewell, the dean of St George's College in Jerusalem and one of the Church's top figures in the holy city, said it was difficult to get reliable information about what happened but that he could confirm the hospital had been hit and that a "horrific number of people" had died.He told the BBC that about 6,000 displaced people had been sheltering in the hospital courtyard at the end of last week. The hospital was first hit by an Israeli air strike that caused damage and injured four people on Saturday, he said. After that, 5,000 people left the courtyard - leaving around 1,000 remaining there, many of them invalids or elderly who needed transportation.Revd Sewell said about 600 patients and staff treating them had been inside the hospital at the time of Monday's explosion, but that he believed most of those killed had been outside."There is no justification for this type of attack, accidental or deliberate," he added. "It is an absolute horror show which is unfolding."Zaher Kuhail, a British-Palestinian civil engineering consultant and university professor who was nearby at the time, told the BBC that what he had witnessed was "beyond imagination"."I [saw] two rockets coming from an F-16 or an F-35 [fighter jet], shelling these people and killing them ruthlessly, without any mercy," he said. He added that many people had been killed by fires sparked by the explosion and that first responders had lacked the equipment they needed to rescue survivors.The health ministry in Gaza said 500 people had been killed and hundreds more were feared trapped under the rubble.Hamas blamed an Israeli strike for what it called a "horrific massacre".A spokesperson for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who is based in the occupied West Bank, accused Israel of a "heinous crime". Anger also spilled onto the streets in the West Bank. Hundreds of protesters clashed with PA security forces who responded by firing tear gas. The Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) first response was to stress that it did not target hospitals, and it urged caution about "unverified claims".Later, chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a video statement: "Following an additional review and cross-examination of the operational and intelligence systems, it is clear that the IDF did not strike the hospital in Gaza.""The hospital was hit as a result of a failed rocket launched by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organisation," he said.He said 450 of the thousands of rockets fired indiscriminately towards Israel since the beginning of the war had fallen within Gaza, endangering civilians.Palestinian Islamic Jihad denied that any of its rockets had been involved, saying it had not carried out any activity around Gaza City at the time.The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was shocked and horrified by the reports."Hospitals should be sanctuaries to preserve human life, not scenes of death and destruction. No patient should be killed in a hospital bed. No doctors should lose their lives while trying to save others," a statement said."Hospitals must be protected under international humanitarian law." The World Health Organization also called for the immediate protection of civilians and healthcare and urged the Israeli military to reverse the evacuation orders it has issued to 20 hospitals in northern of Gaza ahead of what is expected to be a major ground offensive."The order for evacuation has been impossible to carry out given the current insecurity, critical condition of many patients, and lack of ambulances, staff, health system bed capacity, and alternative shelter for those displaced."Are you in the region?

17/10/2023 22:41:00	Family tell of heartbreak after Israel kidnap live-stream - BBC News	Videos have emerged from the 7 October attacks by Hamas on civilians in southern Israel, showing some of those targeted being held in their homes and live-streamed by the attackers themselves.More than a week on from the attacks, relatives of the victims desperate for information are using these videos to try to piece together what happened to them, and some have expressed frustration with the Israeli authorities' lack of progress in finding their loved ones. One of those is Nir Darwish, a UK-based relative of a family of five who disappeared from the Nahal Oz kibbutz. The family - Noam Elyakim, his partner Dikla Arava, her 17-year-old son Tomer, and Noam's two daughters Daphna, 15, and Ella, 8 - are seen apparently being held in their home by the attackers. The girls, who live with their mother, were thought to be visiting their father to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the kibbutz.But on Monday this week, the extended family got news from the authorities that Dikla and Tomer had been killed and that their bodies had been found outside the kibbutz.Mr Darwish says that several photos posted by Hamas show Ella and Daphna in captivity. The BBC has been unable to independently verify this.On Tuesday, Mr Darwish told the BBC that it had been confirmed that Noam - who is seen in the live-streamed video with a leg wound - was dead. The last photo of him appears to show him being led down a dusty road by the attackers.Nir, a cousin of the Elyakims, believes the girls are in Gaza, and that Hamas is keeping them in a tunnel somewhere."They are sitting [in the photos] on a mattress and there is no natural light, so that's 100% in Gaza," he tells the BBC.He adds that some time passed between the live stream and the photos being posted, which would have given the attackers time to get back to Gaza.Mr Darwish said he and other family members found the video of the girls heart-breaking. He was very pessimistic about what would happen to them."Nobody wants to go through this and especially when it's two little girls and especially when you know what's going to happen to them, because they're not going to give them water and food and treat them nice," he says.He said the planned Israeli ground operation was a "big mistake" and believes the military will never find the hostages.The Israeli military says it is using "all intelligence and operational measures" for the return of the captives, whose presence at unknown locations in Gaza will greatly complicate any operation.The girls' mother Maayan, however, is trying to stay upbeat. She spoke to the BBC from her home in Israel."Stay strong, look out for one another. Look out for daddy - daddy will look after you, and take care of you," she says in a message to her daughters. "We are doing everything to bring you back. We are very strong here. We will bring you back."She described the girls, saying one loved to sing, the other to dance, and that they were inseparable.The BBC has been unable to access the full half-hour of the live stream of militants inside Noam and Dikla's house, but has seen extracts of it.Filmed on Dikla's phone, it appears to show the family sitting on a bench in their home. As it is streamed, shocked messages from friends and family can be seen on her screen.Noam is injured, and losing a lot of blood from what looks like a serious leg wound. At one point, he limps away, escorted by one of the militants after they ask him for his ID card. His partner and daughters are clearly frightened.Nir Darwish talks through with the BBC another part of the video, in which the attackers take Tomer out of the house to knock on doors of neighbours, to persuade them that the danger has passed and that they can come out.He believes that this is to "make life easier for the terrorists... to capture them, kill them or whatever it is".No-one does come out of the house shown, but Nir says that later the attackers threw flaming tyres into the house to burn it down.It is not clear if anyone died in this incident, but it is possible that these types of tactics were used elsewhere and did contribute to the loss of life.	
17/10/2023 20:37:00	Layla Moran: My relatives have nowhere to go in Gaza after bombing - BBC News	An MP has said members of her extended family have "nowhere to go" after their house was bombed in Gaza City.Liberal Democrat Layla Moran told the BBC her relatives had sought shelter in a church after Israeli warnings of a ground offensive.She said they do not have food, water and power after fleeing south to avoid to the Israeli assault.Israel has blocked supplies of food, water, fuel, and electricity since the deadly Hamas attacks.Ms Moran, who became the UK's first MP of Palestinian descent when she was elected in 2017, issued an emotional plea to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and urged Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to speak up for civilians."I would like to see Rishi Sunak take a more strident stance when it comes to humanitarian aid, in particular when it comes to letting it in," said Ms Moran."I want to see them stress the importance of international humanitarian law, which very clearly puts innocent civilians first."The UK government "believe it is vital that water supplies are restored" in Gaza and continued to urge Israel to act within international law, a Downing Street spokesperson said.Ms Moran said that while she was not in direct contact with her relatives in Gaza, she was receiving information from members of her immediate family in the West Bank.The MP said: "They are still there, because what they've said is, first of all, it's three generations. One is very old, and they also said they have nowhere to go."She also said she was worried for her family in the West Bank, because "there is a concern of course that this violence starts to escalate, starts to spread".At least 1,400 Israelis were killed in the Hamas attack on 7 October, when gunmen infiltrated communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 2,700 Palestinians have been killed in numerous air strikes against Gaza by the Israeli military that were launched following the attack.Hundreds of thousands of people from northern Gaza have moved to southern areas after the Israeli military warned civilians to move there for their own safety.Israel says northern Gaza is a Hamas stronghold and has warned it will be the target of its assault.In an interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain earlier, TV presenter Richard Madeley asked Ms Moran if "there was any word on the street" before Hamas launched its attack on Israel.Following outrage on social media, a GMB spokesman said Madeley was "sorry that he upset viewers with his question" and "his intention was to understand the mood and atmosphere amongst the civilian population of Gaza immediately before the attacks". The statement added: "He did not mean to imply that she or her family might have had any prior knowledge of the attacks."Ms Moran told the BBC she did not think the presenter's question "came from a place of malice"."And what I'm sad about is that it's distracted from these more important messages about putting our collective humanity first, about peace, about what we do next and about finding a solution for the future."Ms Moran, the foreign affairs spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said it was important to stress the "clear distinction" between Hamas and civilians in Gaza."These are innocent civilians paying a price for something they had nothing to do with," she said."I want the government to not just say they want Israel to adhere to international humanitarian law, but also to keep pressing that point and ask them to do the right thing regardless."Ms Moran mentioned her extended family's situation when Mr Sunak gave a statement to the House of Commons on the Israel-Hamas conflict on Monday.The MP said the bombing of her relatives' home in Gaza meant she shared "profound emotions of loss and grief" with the Jewish community.Mr Sunak expressed his sympathies, and paid tribute to "the fact that she looks forward to a more positive future - it's an ambition that I share".The prime minister said "we must find a way to move forward, to secure a more stable, peaceful settlement".	
17/10/2023 18:32:00	Gaza: BBC reporter and family left homeless again after Israel air strike warning - BBC News	It was just before 3pm in Gaza on Tuesday. I was preparing to go live on BBC TV News when I received a call from my wife - almost in tears, the kids crying in the background. They'd been told to leave the apartment we'd been staying in because of a warning the Israeli air force was going to bomb next door.I told her to grab the children and leave immediately. My colleague Mahmoud was nearby and I rang him to ask him to help.For the second time in five days, my family was fleeing - running from the bombing.On Friday, we had packed up our house in Gaza City, after the Israelis told everybody in northern Gaza to move south for their own safety. We moved with my father-in-law and my wife's sister and their families. Like thousands of other families, we drove to the city of Khan Younis. We spent hours and hours looking for anywhere we could stay.  It wasn't easy. An already crowded city of 400,000 people was swelling to take in more than a million.  Finally, we found a house where the owners agreed to let us share with another family.  We thought the neighbourhood Al Amal looked busy, had a bakery and a pharmacy and that we would be safe because it had so many people in it.  Together with the other families in the building, we helped each other find water and food.But then the owner of the building said he had received a phone call. The caller identified themselves as an Israeli soldier, checked the owner's name and said the building should be evacuated because the building next door (only a metre away) was going to be destroyed.  We all left straight away and got to a safe distance leaving many of our possessions. It was impossible to know when Israel would bomb, in five minutes or the next day.  I told the family to go to the Red Cross (ICRC) hospital, about 700 metres away, just to be sure.So now we are homeless again. I've knocked on the door of a house near the hospital and have asked the family inside to look after my wife and children for a few hours, so I can work out what to do next.Honestly, I don't know what to do - it is hard to be a reporter and try to look after my family like this. I struggle to find food and water for them. We now don't have a home.I've covered the previous wars in Gaza but this is the first time my family has been so affected.  I can cope when I'm in danger but when your family is too, you feel guilty.	
17/10/2023 18:21:00	Met Police question London family of doctor in Gaza - BBC News	A surgeon from London working in Gaza City has described how police turned up at his UK home to question his wife.Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, who is based at the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, told BBC's Newsnight that to have his family "harassed in this way is just bizarre".The Met Police said Dr Abu-Sittah's home was visited by officers because the force received a report that "a man was planning to travel to a warzone".He said he had taken up the matter with his lawyers.Dr Abu-Sittah explained: "I need to find out why someone thought it would be a good idea to show up at my house and ask my wife which hospital I worked at, why did I go [to Gaza], who paid for my ticket and which charity do I work for."My family are seeing this bombing unfold knowing full well that I am in the midst of it... It's a kind of brutish attempt at harassment and silencing."He said it was his duty "to bear witness to the carnage" seen in Gaza, adding: "As if my wife did not have enough to worry about that she had to endure this today (Monday)."Dr Abu-Sittah spoke of the dire conditions he was working in, with children comprising 40% of the patients he has seen.He added that resources were running out fast with water pressure now insufficient to supply some of the equipment."The surgical capacity of the hospital is unable to deal with the sheer number of wounded, 9,000 in 10 days," Dr Abu-Sittah said."Fifty families here have been wiped off the civil register [in the hospital area], from grandparents to newborns." A Met Police spokesperson said: "On 16 October, police officers responding to a report that a man was planning to travel to a warzone attended an address in north London where they spoke with one of the occupants."Having identified that the man had left the UK for humanitarian purposes, the officers signposted the occupant to current FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office) advice."Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

17/10/2023 16:56:00	Dozens killed as Israeli strikes hit southern Gaza refuge areas - BBC News	More than 100 Palestinians have been killed in air strikes in southern Gaza, officials say, as the Israeli military continues to target the area despite ordering civilians to shelter there.Most of the dead reportedly fled their homes in the north ahead of what is expected to be a major ground offensive against the militant group Hamas.The military said it struck a series of Hamas targets in the south.There is also mounting concern about humanitarian conditions in Gaza.The US said it had agreed to develop a plan with Israel that would enable aid to reach civilians in the Hamas-governed territory, as UN aid agencies warned that hospitals' fuel supplies were unlikely to last more than 24 hours, water was extremely limited and shops only had a few days of food left.There have been hopes of opening Egypt's Rafah crossing to let lorryloads of urgently needed aid in and Palestinians with foreign passports out. But an Israeli strike reportedly damaged a building at the crossing on Monday.Israel cut electricity and most water and stopped deliveries of food and medicine through its crossings in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas militants on 7 October in which at least 1,300 people were killed and 199 others taken hostage.Around 3,000 people have been killed in Israel's bombardment of Gaza since then, according to health officials.The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf in Khan Younis says that what happened overnight in southern Gaza is very worrying for the hundreds of thousands of people who have complied with last Friday's order from the Israeli military to evacuate northern Gaza for their "own safety".Local officials in Khan Younis said three Israeli air strikes left more than 100 people dead, most of whom were displaced.Amin Hneideq said his daughter was wounded by a bomb that destroyed a nearby home and killed a family who had fled southwards. "They brought them from the north just to strike them in the south," he told Reuters news agency.The Israeli military said on Tuesday morning that it had struck operational command centres, military infrastructure with operatives inside, and hideouts belonging to Hamas in Khan Younis and Rafah, to the south, as well as two northern areas.Later, it announced that a strike had killed a top Hamas military commander, Ayman Nofal, who it described as "one of the most dominant figures in the terrorist organisation". Hamas said he died in a strike in Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.Many displaced people in Khan Younis told the BBC that they were planning to pack up their belongings and return to their homes. One man said he had been sleeping in the street for the last couple of days, and that he would prefer to die in dignity than to die from thirst.Khan Younis, Rafah and other southern communities have been overwhelmed by the need to accommodate and feed more than 600,000 displaced people. Another 400,000 people have sought shelter elsewhere in the Strip. "Every day it's a daily mission for everyone to go to find things to feed their children," filmmaker Yousef Hammash told BBC Radio 5 Live, adding that everyone was suffering extreme stress and were existing in "survival mode".Some water was brought to Khan Younis from a store in Gaza City on Tuesday, which was risky because there was no guarantee the lorries would not be targeted by Israeli forces.The UN's agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said Israel opened one line of water to southern Gaza for three hours on Monday, but that only 14% of the Strip's 2.2 million population were able to benefit. Gaza's last functioning seawater desalination plant was also forced to shut down due to a lack of fuel, increasing concerns over dehydration and waterborne diseases.The hospital in Khan Younis, which has been struggling to treat some of the 12,500 people so far wounded in air strikes, said it would run out of fuel for its back-up generators at midnight, placing the lives of patients at serious risk.People have been trying to secure additional fuel at local petrol stations and companies, which would allow the hospital to keep functioning.The World Food Programme also said that food shops in Gaza had just four or five days of supplies left. It added that there might be a few days' more in warehouses, but the Israeli strikes were making access very difficult. Despite such warnings, an Israeli military spokesman insisted that "there is no humanitarian crisis right now in Gaza"."We do not have the commitment to supply Hamas electricity," Lt Col Richard Hecht told BBC Newsnight. "People who attacked us, they've been in control for multiple years already in the Gaza Strip. They have electricity... I also see water in the south of Gaza."The UN human rights office meanwhile said Israel's order for 1.1 million civilians to evacuate, combined with the imposition of its "complete siege" on Gaza, could constitute the "forcible transfer of civilians in violation of international law".A spokeswoman also said reports of attacks on civilians attempting to flee had to be investigated independently and warned that "we cannot have collective punishment of an entire population because of an attack by militants."She appealed again for Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups to immediately and unconditionally release all of the hostages being held in Gaza and to stop firing indiscriminate rockets at Israeli cities and towns.Overnight, Hamas released a video of a 21-year-old Israeli-French woman, Mia Shem, who said she was captured at a music festival where at least 260 other partygoers were massacred. On Tuesday, her mother Keren told a news conference: "I'm begging the world to bring my baby back home. She only went to a party to have some fun. And now she's in Gaza and she's not the only one."There are babies and children and old people, Holocaust survivors, who were kidnapped... This is a crime against humanity."In a separate development, the Israeli military said it had carried out new strikes on targets belonging to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in response to cross-border anti-tank missile fire. Troops also killed four militants who attempted to infiltrate Israeli territory and plant an explosive device, it added.The Israeli military and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire almost daily since Hamas's attack, raising fears of a regional war.	
17/10/2023 16:47:00	Hamas: Who are the group's most prominent leaders? - BBC News	Since Hamas blindsided Israel with its most ambitious attack ever launched from Gaza, questions have been raised over who masterminded the deadly invasion.Many of the highest-ranking men belonging to the militant Palestinian group controlling Gaza keep a low public profile, while others have spent much of their lives evading assassination attempts by Israel.These are Hamas's most prominent leaders.Ismail Haniyeh is widely considered Hamas's overall leader.A prominent member of the movement in the late 1980s, Israel imprisoned Haniyeh for three years in 1989 as it cracked down on the first Palestinian uprising.He was then exiled in 1992 to a no-man's-land between Israel and Lebanon, along with a number of Hamas leaders.After a year in exile, he returned to Gaza. In 1997 he was appointed head of the office of Hamas's spiritual leader, strengthening his position.Haniyeh was appointed Palestinian prime minister in 2006 by President Mahmoud Abbas after Hamas won the most seats in national elections, but was dismissed a year later after the group ousted Mr Abbas' Fatah party from the Gaza Strip in a week of deadly violence. Haniyeh rejected his sacking as "unconstitutional", stressing that his government "would not abandon its national responsibilities towards the Palestinian people", and continued to rule in Gaza.He was elected head of Hamas's political bureau in 2017.In 2018, the US Department of State designated Haniyeh a terrorist. He has lived in Qatar for the past several years.The leader of the Hamas movement within the Gaza Strip, Yahya Sinwar, was born in 1962. He is the founder of the Hamas security service known as Majd, which manages internal security matters, investigates suspected Israeli agents and tracks down Israeli intelligence and security services officers.Sinwar has been arrested three times. After his third arrest in 1988 he was sentenced to four life terms in prison.However, he was among 1,027 Palestinian and Israeli Arab prisoners released by Israel in exchange for an Israeli soldier held captive for over five years by Hamas.Sinwar returned to his position as a prominent leader in Hamas and was appointed head of the group's political bureau in the Gaza Strip in 2017.In 2015, the US included Sinwar on its blacklist of "international terrorists".Mohammed Deif leads the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of the Hamas movement. He is a shadowy figure known to Palestinians as The Mastermind, and to Israelis as The Cat with Nine Lives.Israeli authorities imprisoned him in 1989, after which he formed the al-Qassam Brigades with the aim of capturing Israeli soldiers.After his release, he helped engineer the construction of tunnels that have allowed Hamas fighters to get inside Israel from Gaza,Deif is one of Israel's most-wanted men, accused of planning and supervising bus bombings which killed tens of Israelis in 1996, and of involvement in the capture and killing of three Israeli soldiers in the mid-1990s. Israel imprisoned him in 2000, but he escaped at the beginning of the second Palestinian uprising, or intifada. Since then, he has left behind little trace. There are three known pictures of him: one is dated, he is masked in the second, and the third is of his shadow.The most serious assassination attempts on his life were in 2002: Deif survived but lost one of his eyes. Israel says he also lost a foot and a hand, and that he has difficulty speaking.Israeli security forces again failed to assassinate Deif during a 2014 assault on the Gaza Strip, but killed his wife and two of his children.Marwan Issa, or the Shadow Man and Mohammed Deif's right-hand man, is the deputy commander-in-chief of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades.Israeli forces detained him during the first intifada for five years due to his activity with Hamas.The Palestinian Authority arrested Issa in 1997, but he was freed after the second intifada in 2000.He was on Israel's most-wanted list, and was injured when Israel attempted to assassinate him in 2006.Israeli warplanes also destroyed his house twice during invasions of Gaza in 2014 and 2021, killing his brother.It was not known what Issa looked like until 2011, when he appeared in a group photo taken during a reception for exchanged prisoners.He is thought to have played a significant role in planning incursions into Israel, including the most recent.Khaled Meshaal, who was born in the West Bank in 1956, is considered one of the founders of Hamas. Under direct instructions from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's Mossad spy agency attempted to assassinate Meshaal in 1997 while he was living in Jordan,  Mossad agents entered Jordan with forged Canadian passports and Meshaal was injected with a toxic substance while walking along a street.Jordanian authorities discovered the assassination attempt and arrested two Mossad members. The late King Hussein of Jordan asked Israel's PM for the antidote for the substance Meshaal was injected with. Facing pressure from then US President Bill Clinton, Mr Netanyahu provided the antidote after initially rejecting the request.Meshaal, who lives in Qatar, visited the Gaza Strip for the first time in 2012. He was received by Palestinian officials and crowds of Palestinians came out to welcome him.Hamas elected Ismail Haniyeh to succeed Meshaal as head of its political bureau in 2017, and Meshaal became head of the group's political bureau abroad.Mahmoud Zahar was born in Gaza in 1945 to a Palestinian father and an Egyptian mother. He is considered one of Hamas' most prominent leaders, and a member of the movement's political leadership.He went to school in Gaza and university in Cairo, then worked as a doctor in Gaza and Khan Younis until Israeli authorities dismissed him over his political position. Mahmoud Zahar was held in Israeli prisons in 1988, months after the founding of Hamas. He was among those deported by Israel to no-man's land in 1992, where he spent a year.With the Hamas movement winning Palestinian general elections in 2006, Zahar joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh's newly formed government before its eventual dismissal.Israel attempted to assassinate Zahar in 2003, when a plane dropped a bomb on his house in Gaza City. The attack left him with minor injuries, but killed his eldest son, Khaled.His second son, Hossam, who was a member of the al-Qassam Brigades, was killed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza in 2008.	
17/10/2023 16:46:00	Why Egypt remains reluctant to open Rafah crossing to Gaza - BBC News	Egypt has long played a role as a mediator in the conflict not just between Israel and the Palestinians, but also between the main Palestinian factions themselves. It was the first Arab state to make peace with Israel back in 1978 - after fighting several wars with the Jewish state.  Now, the focus is on Egypt's control of one of the two land routes out of the Gaza Strip - the Rafah crossing.Thousands of Palestinians are waiting on the Gaza side of the border, while hundreds of lorries carrying desperately needed aid are parked up on the Egyptian side. Many more aid convoys are also heading towards the border.But there has still been no deal on opening the crossing, which has also reportedly been hit by several Israeli strikes in the past few days.Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told the BBC's Newshour programme that from Egypt's perspective, "the Rafah crossing on our side is officially open", but he blamed "aerial bombardments" for making the crossing "inaccessible" and unsafe for aid lorries to cross into Gaza.But Cairo has kept tight restrictions on movement through the Rafah crossing for many years - to such an extent that many Palestinians have essentially accused Egypt of bolstering Israel's blockade of Gaza, which has been in place since Hamas took full power there in 2007.  The restrictions have mostly been about security concerns in North Sinai where the Egyptian authorities have long been involved in a deadly conflict with jihadists linked to Al Qaeda. But Egypt's apparent reluctance to open the crossing without clear conditions and guarantees may be more about trying to avoid a mass exodus of Palestinians from Gaza.The UN's humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, says the Egyptian authorities fear a great influx of Gazans - for whom they would then be responsible, for an indefinite period.In addition, Egypt does not want to play any role in what could amount to a permanent resettlement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza. It seems prepared to allow foreigners and Palestinians with dual nationality to leave, but it wants this to be dependent on allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza.A further stumbling block is that Israel seems to want pretty much the opposite - to allow more Palestinians to leave than Egypt is prepared to accept, while limiting the amount of aid that could go in.Reflecting Egypt's position, Mr Shoukry told the BBC: "It's not a matter of transferring the responsibility to Egypt - it is a matter of maintaining the safety and well-being of Gazans on their own territory."He has also said the Israeli government has not yet adopted a position that would allow the crossing to be opened.Diplomatic efforts are intensifying to try to resolve the impasse, as aid agencies warn that the situation in Gaza is edging closer to a humanitarian catastrophe.	
17/10/2023 14:24:00	Ex-wife of IS 'Beatle' speaks out for first time - BBC News	A Canadian woman has spoken for the first time about her marriage to one of the IS "Beatles" and her time living with him in Syria.Despite global news coverage of savagery by the Islamic State (IS) group, Dure Ahmed claims she was "oblivious to what was going on" while her then-British husband El Shafee Elsheikh was committing atrocities. He was part of a murderous IS cell linked to the abduction, torture and beheading of Western hostages.The mother of two claims she wasn't radicalised, but was just "a dumb girl in love".She agreed to answer questions from the BBC and Canadian broadcaster, CBC. "I'm not looking for sympathy or pity," she explained.Ahmed expects a backlash for speaking publicly, she says, but wants to highlight the plight of the women and children of suspected IS fighters still stuck in Syrian camps. She was held in such a camp for more than three years.She says she now needs to accept that her time with Elsheikh was part of her life "whether I like it or not".Ahmed claims Elsheikh had not told her he had joined IS before she left to be with him. She insists she was unaware of the group's jihadist ideology when she travelled from Canada to Syria in 2014. She claims she barely recognised the controlling and violent figure her now ex-husband had become.Elsheikh and the others in his IS cell were nicknamed the "Beatles" by their captives because of their British accents. The men were responsible for the deaths of several hostages - most of whom were beheaded - with the deaths filmed and posted on social media.At his 2022 trial in the US, prosecutors said Elsheikh's actions resulted in the deaths of four Americans - journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig. They said he also conspired in the deaths of two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning - as well as Japanese journalists Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto.The bodies have never been found. Elsheikh - from west London - is now serving eight life sentences in a US supermax prison. The UK stripped him of his citizenship before his conviction.But, while he is in jail, questions remain about how much others - such as his wife Ahmed - knew about what IS were doing.  Ahmed joined Elsheikh in Syria two months after the murders carried out by his IS cell had caused outrage around the world. It was also just after IS had committed numerous atrocities while seizing the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, and  started a genocide against Iraq's Yazidi religious minority.  During Ahmed's time out there, she gave birth to two sons. She and her boys were among a group of women and children repatriated to Canada in April. The 33-year-old was arrested upon arrival on a "terrorism peace bond," and later granted bail with conditions. On Monday, those conditions were reviewed in a court in Brampton, Ontario. The Crown lawyer argued that Ahmed had been "steeped" in IS ideology and it would have been "likely" that she knew of her husband's role with the group before leaving Canada in 2014.The Crown and Ahmed's legal team put forward a joint proposal with conditions that would include her being monitored by GPS - and being subjected to a curfew between the hours of 22:00 and 06:00. The judge said he would deliver his ruling on 19 October.We interviewed Dure Ahmed twice - most recently in Toronto last week, where she spoke more freely. But our first meeting was in the detention camp in Syria last November. There, she had offered to speak to us about a missing British child we were searching for, as part of an upcoming BBC-CBC podcast series - Bloodlines. At first, we had no idea of her husband's identity - but, after investigating further we learned about the connection. We then wanted to know about Elsheikh's radicalisation, his victims and his fellow IS "Beatles". Ahmed and Elsheikh met in Toronto in 2007. She was 17, he was 19. We asked how they had first connected as teenagers in Canada. "Smoking weed," she laughed. "He didn't care about God, it was nothing to do with IS." The pair kept in touch when Elsheikh - the son of Sudanese refugees - returned to London. In 2010, they were married in an Islamic ceremony - but the relationship remained largely long distance, as Ahmed stayed in Toronto where she was studying for an English degree. In London, Elsheikh became drawn to extremism and met the men who would become his fellow IS militants."He wasn't a social person. He's such an introvert. So he had all the qualities that can lead somebody into that dark path of radicalisation," she explains.In 2012, Elsheikh travelled to Syria to fight in the country's civil war - he then joined IS. He was constantly encouraging his wife to join him."'Come check it out. You could go back.' As if it was so simple," she told us. Elsheikh refused to give her details of what he was doing in Syria - she claims - and says she didn't even know which city he was living in. "For the most part, I thought that not knowing was better than knowing." But, as she pondered making the trip, she claims members of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service - CSIS - questioned her about her husband."They [CSIS] did explain in Syria that there are things happening where it's not as black and white as I thought it was. [But] they didn't show me video."Ahmed claims she had nothing to tell CSIS and that she told Elsheikh that agents had contacted her. CSIS told the BBC it was not able to comment on the specifics of any case.BloodlinesAs Islamic State group fell, what became of the children of its fighters?Listen now on BBC Sounds Ahmed was 24 and a jobless graduate when she did finally travel. She claims she had not seen the horrors of the IS beheadings which were being reported widely at the time. "It might be really hard to think, but it's honestly the truth."We put to her that she was a smart woman who had been on a Middle Eastern studies course - surely she would have been aware of what was happening to Muslims across the world at that time?"I distanced myself from what was happening in Syria," she replied. Her study topics included the hieroglyphics of ancient Egypt, she told us, not current affairs. According to Ahmed, Elsheikh arranged everything - all she had to do was "hop on a plane" to Turkey. "I just carried a carry-on. Three pairs of pants and two T-shirts." In our years of reporting on IS, we've both found that most women don't want to talk about why or how they got involved with the group. Everyone's got their own story.Some were victims of domestic abuse, some were duped or trafficked. Some came willingly as adventure seekers. Some followed their husbands and children. Some were children themselves.And then, of course, there were all those women, who were committed, hard-core adherents to the IS ideology.Ahmed denies having supported IS. In her answers to us, she preferred to paint herself as a naive romantic. When we spoke to her in the Syrian detention camp, she condemned IS - even though it was risky to do so in such a place.Elsheikh and Ahmed lived in Raqqa - Islamic State group's de facto capital in Syria - where summary killings at a city centre roundabout became commonplace, with severed heads put on display afterwards.During our interview in the Syrian camp, Ahmed told us daily life had involved doing normal things with female friends, including going to restaurants or taking children on ferris wheels. When we talked again - in the safety of Toronto - about life under IS rule, she denied Elsheikh's prominent role allowed them to have a lavish lifestyle. In fact, she claimed, her house in Raqqa had felt like a prison - they rarely went out. No phone or internet - just her, her children and Elsheikh's other wife. Polygamy was common. We asked if they'd had Yazidi slaves in the home - she said they hadn't.Her husband was "so private", she claimed. "We couldn't even pull up the blinds." She told us she believes her children are lucky to be alive, given the violence Elsheikh inflicted on her while she was pregnant. Ahmed claims she tried to run away many times but her only option was to return - there was no family or support system under IS. She eventually left after he divorced her, seeking refuge with her boys in a guest house for women.We pointed out that she had disclosed additional information during our second interview - and asked if it was just convenient for her to say these things now because she was back in Canada and at risk of going to jail."If I'm going to be charged, I'm going to get charged regardless. So it doesn't really make a difference," she replied.Being physically away from Syria "looking at it from the outside… I think it just gives me more clarity".Elsheikh was captured in early 2018 by Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-backed Kurdish-led militia alliance, but it would be another year before Ahmed surrendered with her boys in the village of Baghuz - not long before IS made its last stand there. Canada is one of the nations which has repatriated some of the families of IS fighters. The US, Spain, Sweden, Germany and France are doing the same.The UK, meanwhile, has stripped citizenship from people who travelled to live under IS. These individuals include Shamima Begum, one of the schoolgirls who went to Syria in 2015. She went on to marry an IS fighter and now lives in the same camp in Syria that Ahmed was in. Leaving women and children in the Syrian camps, claims Ahmed, won't help conquer the "radical path a lot of people go down".  She claims she isn't simply seeking to smooth her public image - but rather, she is speaking publicly because she is grateful she and her children have been given a second chance.Elsheikh was convicted, but he had pleaded not guilty in court. Ahmed says he needs to admit what he did for the sake of his children and the families of his victims. "This is something he has to talk to my kids about. It can't just stop at his sentence."She claims that when court restrictions allow, she will speak to her ex-husband in jail - having offered to ask him questions on behalf of the victims' families including the locations of their loved ones' bodies.	
17/10/2023 14:02:00	Mia Shem: Mother's plea for daughter release after Hamas hostage video - BBC News	The mother of Mia Shem, seized by Hamas gunmen and held hostage in Gaza, has appealed for her immediate release along with at least 198 other hostages."I'm begging the world to bring my baby back home," Keren Shem told reporters in Tel Aviv, holding up a picture of her French-Israeli daughter.The Islamist militant group released a video on Monday night, in which Mia Shem appeared with a wounded arm."She only went... to a festival party to have some fun," her mother said."And now she's in Gaza and she's not the only one."The Hamas hostage video is the first of its kind to be aired since they abducted Israelis, dual nationals and foreign citizens on Israeli soil on 7 October. Hamas's armed wing said in a separate video that the non-Israeli hostages were "our guests", who would be freed when circumstances allowed.Mia Shem, 21, is shown being treated for her injury and asking in Hebrew to be returned as quickly as possible to her family.The French foreign ministry condemned the video as vile and President Emmanuel Macron demanded Mia Shem's immediate release: "It is an ignominy to take innocent people hostage and put them on show in this odious way."France has said it is working to secure the release of all 13 hostages with French nationality. Another 19 French citizens were among the 1,400 people killed when Hamas gunmen attacked more than 20 Israeli communities as well as the Tribe of Nova music festival.Israel's military denounced the Hamas video as "psychological terror against Israeli citizens", adding that it was in constant touch with the young woman's family. Hamas had murdered and abducted babies, women, children and the elderly and was now "trying to portray itself as a humane organisation", it added.Keren Shem told a press conference on Tuesday that "babies, children and old people, Holocaust survivors" had been kidnapped. "This is a crime against humanity and we should all gather and stop this terror, and bring everybody back home."Israel's military says at least 199 hostages are now thought to have been seized by Hamas, which claims to have hidden them in "safe places and tunnels". Israeli medical officials who are in touch with their families have said many have medical conditions requiring immediate access to life-saving medicines. Citizens from a number of countries are being held, including up to 10 from the UK, and Foreign Office Minister Andrew Mitchell has said the government is doing all it can to get them back as soon as possible.However, one senior Hamas figure has insisted that "foreign prisoners" cannot be freed because of the Israeli military's continuing air strikes on the Gaza Strip.Hamas's military wing said on Monday that 22 hostages have been killed in the bombardment, but there has been no independent confirmation of that.	
17/10/2023 12:58:00	In Gaza, wounded children with no surviving family - BBC News	"There is no lonelier place in this universe than around the bed of a wounded child who has no more family to look after them," British doctor Ghassan Abu Sittah, who is working in Gaza City, posted online.Normally a plastic and reconstructive surgeon in the UK, in Gaza he has been working at the Al Shifa hospital in Gaza City, treating people wounded in Israel's retaliatory air strikes after Hamas launched a deadly attack against Israel, killing at least 1,400 people.About 40% of the wounded people being brought to hospital were children, he told BBC Radio 4."It's all blast injuries, there are these horrendous injuries with shrapnel and burns and fallen masonry, people being dug out from underneath the rubble of their homes," he told the BBC.He describes the scenes he's seeing in Gaza as "the phenomenon of wounded child, no surviving family"."Every day we have these cases where we are told this is the only surviving family member," he said.On Sunday he said he treated a five-year-old girl with burns and another four-year-old girl also with facial burns and a head injury."They were the only ones who were dug up from the family home as survivors," he said.Days earlier he found himself operating on the child of a doctor at Gaza City's al-Shifa hospital. The doctor had been killed with her other child and the wounded girl was the only survivor.Authorities in Gaza say at least 2,750 people have so far been killed, a quarter of them children, and nearly 10,000 people wounded. Another 1,000 people were missing and believed to be under rubble.Carolyn Housman runs CFAB, an international social service network that will work to help those left orphaned by war.Her organisation cannot predict the scale of those left without family members yet, but it will be "huge", she says."Very often children can be used for tactical advantage, for example by taking them hostage," she says.Hamas has taken nearly 200 hostages into Gaza, including young and disabled children. Negotiations over their release and that of women also taken hostage are reportedly taking place."We are working to reconnect children from either side of the war to their families, regardless of their circumstances," she says. Some of this is done through an inter-country social work team who undertake assessments of family members overseas to see if it would be in the child's best interests to live with them.In the UK, cases are then processed by family courts to determine the outcome for the child."Any child who loses parents as a result of war will be traumatised by this experienced and it will be a long road of recovery for them," she said. "There will be hundreds, if not thousands affected by this."In Gaza, groups working with refugees said there had already been a huge demand for psychosocial support and counselling for young people before the latest war."Now with the trauma, PTSD and depression children are going through, it can only be getting worse," said Tamara Alrifai from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).Dr Abu Sittah meanwhile says that his family in the UK has been visited by British counter terrorism police.In an interview with the BBC's Newsnight programme he said that his family were questioned and it is now being taken up with his lawyers.He said: "I need to find out why someone thought it was a good idea to ask my wife which part of the hospital I'm in, who paid for my ticket, and which charity I work for.""It's a kind of brutish attempt at harassment… as if my wife did not have enough to worry about," he added.In a statement the Metropolitan Police told the BBC: "On 16 October, police officers responding to a report that a man was planning to travel to a war zone attended an address in north London where they spoke with one of the occupants. "Having identified that the man had left the UK for humanitarian purposes, the officers signposted the occupant to current FCDO advice."Dr Abu Sittah says many people in northern Gaza have not followed the Israeli military's warning to move to the south of Gaza to avoid being targeted.They have stayed in their homes, he says, because the areas said to be safe are being targeted "with the same ferocity" as those that aren't.Meanwhile it is "not possible" to evacuate Al Shifa hospital, he says, where most of the patients are "critically wounded".Many of those staying in their homes in northern Gaza also fear they may be forced out of the territory entirely."Becoming refugees is such a formative part of Palestinian identity and people just do not want to go through this again, and so people are staying put," he said.	
17/10/2023 11:47:00	Palestinian medical aid fundraiser scrapped by Borth venue - BBC News	An event raising money for medical aid for Palestinians in Gaza has been called off by the venue set to host it.The fundraiser, for UK charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, was due to be held at Borth Community Hall, Ceredigion, on 28 October.Organiser Alex Harwood said she was "hurt and dismayed" by the hall's decision to cancel the event. Ray Quant, hall committee chairman, said members did not want to be perceived as supporting only one side.Ms Harwood said the aim of the event was to raise funds for those in need of "medical or life-saving treatment as they are caught up in the most extreme violence and war through no fault of their own"."We were aware of the serious situation where medical aid for victims of conflict was scarce, particularly for children and we were moved to raise funds," she said. Ms Harwood claimed the event was cancelled by the community hall committee as she was told it "could be perceived that the venue would be seen as sympathetic to a terrorist attack"."All we hope is that somewhere along the line compassion and logic will prevail and allow us to raise these much-needed funds," she added.In an email to Ms Harwood on 12 October, seen by the BBC, Mr Quant said: "Our view is that with the present conflict we don't want it to be 'perceived' that the hall committee is promoting one of the protagonists."Even though many on both sides are innocent, because the present situation needs the United Nations or others to broker a humanitarian aid corridor to address the unfolding human crisis."Mr Quant said: "My committee members feel it should be a fundraising event which supports both medical sides of the conflict.  "Borth Community Council has convened a meeting for Thursday evening and following that I will hold a further meeting with the hall committee."Isabelle Railton, Borth Community Council clerk, said: "We're holding a meeting of the community council and any members of the public that would like to attend on Thursday at 19:00 BST."We are not the hall committee, but it has been brought to our attention by members of the public that are unhappy with the decision." The meeting will be held online and members of the public wishing to attend have been asked to contact the community council. On 7 October, Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an attack on Israel, which saw its fighters enter communities near the Gaza Strip, killing more than 1,400 people, and taking many as hostages.Nearly 2,700 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes and a ground offensive is also expected.The largest UN agency in the Gaza Strip is on the verge of collapse, its chief commissioner said.Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, said in a speech from the agency's headquarters in East Jerusalem on Sunday: "Gaza is being strangled and it seems that the world right now has lost its humanity." "If we look at the issue of water - we all know water is life - Gaza is running out of water, and Gaza is running out of life. Soon, I believe, with this there will be no food or medicine either," Mr Lazzarini said, calling the siege in Gaza as "nothing else than collective punishment".	
17/10/2023 11:29:00	Biden to visit Israel as concerns grow over conflict escalating - BBC News	President Joe Biden will visit Israel on Wednesday in a show of support as the US works to prevent the war with Hamas from spreading across the region.The trip was announced by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said Mr Biden would visit at "a critical moment for Israel, for the region and the world".Mr Blinken, who spoke in Tel Aviv on Monday, said the president would stress "ironclad" commitment to Israel.Mr Biden is also expected to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The decision to go ahead with the landmark visit followed more than seven hours of negotiations between the president, Mr Blinken and Mr Netanyahu's war cabinet.When announcing the plans, Mr Blinken said the president would make clear that "Israel has the right and the duty to defend its people from Hamas and other terrorists and prevent future attacks".He also said Mr Biden would receive a briefing on Israel's war aims and strategy, and hear "how it will conduct its operations in a way that minimises civilian casualties and enables humanitarian assistance to flow [to] civilians in Gaza".The trip comes as concern over the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip grows. More than a million people have been displaced inside Gaza, which is one of the world's most densely populated territories, and food, water and fuel are in short supply.Washington estimates that 500 to 600 Americans remain trapped there."It is critical that aid begin flowing into Gaza as soon as possible," Mr Blinken said, adding that the US and Israel had agreed to "develop a plan" to get aid to civilians there.He also said Mr Biden would work to try to secure the release of hostages taken by Hamas, which the US and other Western governments have designated a terrorist organisation.Israel has said at least 199 people are believed to have been taken hostage after the group launched its unprecedented attack from Gaza on 7 October.At least 1,400 people were killed when gunmen breached the border and infiltrated Israeli communities.More than 2,700 people have been killed in retaliatory air strikes against Gaza by the Israeli military. Israel has also massed troops along the border ahead of an expected ground offensive.That offensive, however, is likely to be delayed until after Mr Biden's departure from Israel although officials in the country have not commented on this.Iran earlier warned that Israel would not be allowed to act in Gaza without consequences. Its foreign minister said it could take "pre-emptive action" against Israel in the coming hours.It is thought that would involve the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon, which has been exchanging fire with Israel in recent days.The comment highlighted concern over the risk of a broader regional conflict breaking out, and the US and other Western countries have warned Iran against any escalation.After visiting Israel, Mr Biden will travel to Amman in Jordan where he will meet King Abdullah, Egypt's President Al-Sisi and the President of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas.Those talks will largely focus on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, White House officials said.Mr Blinken, meanwhile, has visited a number of countries in the Middle East since the Hamas attack including Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. 	
17/10/2023 04:03:00	Israel Gaza: US in diplomatic dash to contain conflict - BBC News	President Joe Biden's decision to visit Israel caps a week of intense US diplomacy aimed at shoring up its closest Middle East ally and trying to prevent Israel's war with Hamas from spreading to the region.   The Americans are worried that the audacity of the Hamas attack and the ferocity of the Israeli counter-offensive could spark violence in the West Bank and beyond.    The president will be joining his Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who's been on a frantic swing through the Middle East. Mr Blinken has stressed full US support for a forceful response to the deadly Hamas raid, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis.  But he is also trying to mitigate the civilian casualties in Gaza, the enclave that is governed by the Palestinian militant group. Israel has already killed nearly 3,000 Palestinians in relentless airstrikes, and blocked food, water and electricity to Gaza, plunging it into a humanitarian crisis. "Blinken is trying to thread the needle," says David Schenker, the state department's former top diplomat for the Middle East. "So far, he seems to have managed it relatively well. But it becomes more and more challenging." Mr Blinken's emphasis on protecting civilians grew during his whirlwind tour of America's Arab allies at the end of last week, visiting six countries in three days.  He wanted them to clearly condemn Hamas for the unprecedented scale and brutality of the attack, and hoped to limit criticism of Israel's military campaign.  Only two Arab governments - Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates - denounced Hamas. Others may have done so privately, because most are hostile to Hamas in varying degrees.  In public, though, they focused on the humanitarian tragedy already unfolding in Gaza.  A lengthy Israeli ground operation could inflame their populations, who support the Palestinian cause, threatening stability in their countries and narrowing the diplomatic room that Arab heavyweights such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia have to calm the situation.  Egypt was the most outspoken. Its President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi told Mr Blinken that Israel's military operations had already exceeded "the right of self-defence" and turned into collective punishment.In this environment, some analysts questioned whether Mr Biden's trip to show solidarity with Israel could be seen as provocative. Others suggested it might help to underline a private message of restraint, should the president choose to deliver one.   "He's a very visceral politician," says Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. "It may be that he feels that if you're going to push the Israelis, you can't push them until you've already made clear that you care." Mr Biden will also be meeting the Egyptian leader along with Jordan's King Abdullah and the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Amman to discuss humanitarian issues.This follows the administration's announcement that the US and Israel have agreed to try to find ways to get humanitarian aid into Gaza and set up "safe zones" for civilians.The initiative came after the secretary of state reported back to Washington the concerns of Arab leaders, says a senior state department official. The president instructed him to draw up a plan with the Israelis.Where Mr Biden will not push the Israelis is on their assessment of Hamas.  US officials have adopted Israeli language that compares the Palestinian movement to the Islamic State group, saying it was an attack of "sheer evil" unrelated to legitimate frustrations about decades of Israeli occupation and the grinding misery of its 16-year blockade of Gaza.Khaled Elgindy, the director of Israeli-Palestinian Affairs at the Middle East Institute, says this ignores a chorus of warnings in the year leading up to the unprecedented incursion about an impending "explosion" in the Palestinian territories.  He describes US policy as "strategic neglect".  "They've been committed to keeping the issue low down on the list of priorities," he says. "I think that's one of the reasons we are where we are, is this neglect and allowing these wounds to fester. "The status quo was comfortable for Israel and for the United States. But it was certainly not comfortable for Palestinians."The Biden administration has focused its Middle East policy on integrating Israel into the region through a normalisation agreement with Saudi Arabia, which it argues is crucial for stability, while trying to pivot its attention more to China and Russia's war with Ukraine.  Now, though, it fears a regional conflict that could force it to plunge back into the Middle East.  The US is particularly concerned that Iran will capitalise on the situation through armed groups it supports, like Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement. Low-level clashes on Israel's border with Lebanon intensified at the weekend, as Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian conducted his own tour of allies in the region.  That included a meeting with the Hamas representative in Qatar, where they discussed how to prevent Israel's expected further assault on Gaza, according to Iran's state news agency.  Still, so far Iran has shown relative restraint. "They're playing the long game," says Mr Alterman, "and I'm not sure that this is the moment when they want to go all in."  That could change depending on how Israel's ground operation in Gaza unfolds. The Pentagon has now sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean as a clear warning.   Deterrence is a big part of the administration's "rock solid" show of support for Israel, says Mr Schenker, noting that the extraordinary damage Hamas inflicted on Israel made America's key partner in the Middle East look weak.  "If we don't stand by Israel, we are further raising questions about our commitment to our regional allies," he says. "Already for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, this US commitment to their security was in question." There's no question the US will stand by Israel. The question is at what cost, and how that will affect its ability to shape the new strategic realities to come.  	
16/10/2023 21:24:00	Week 2: BBC correspondents answer your questions on the conflict between Israel and Hamas - BBC News	The world is still reeling from the unprecedent assault by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, and the subsequent retaliatory strikes by Israel and expected land invasion into the Gaza Strip. We have received hundreds of your questions about the conflict, its impact and where it may end, with many people asking if other countries will get involved in the war.Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have answered some of the most frequently asked questions below. Craig Johnson in Skelmersdale, UK asks: If Iran gets directly involved in the conflict, would that prompt the US and its allies to directly join the war? And could this lead to a third world war?Jeremy Bowen, our international editor, reporting from southern Israel, says:When asked about the possibility of intervention by Iran or its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, Joe Biden said: "Don't."The Americans just deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups to the eastern Mediterranean to send a very firm message to Iran to stay out.They're saying that if anyone intervenes, they will have American military might to reckon with, not just Israel's.One of the major fault lines in the Middle East runs between the US and its allies, and the Iranians and theirs.Both sides are aware of the risks. If it went from a cold to a hot war it would ignite a Middle East conflagration of global significance.Luciano Sisi in the Scottish Borders asks: What is Israel's overall objective with the anticipated ground war?Lyse Doucet, our chief international correspondent, in southern Israel says:In past wars, Israel vowed to "hit Hamas hard", to destroy its capacity to fire rockets into Israel - including its vast web of subterranean tunnels.This time is different. Israel is vowing "to destroy Hamas" - an organisation it says should be obliterated, like the Islamic State group.Israel has the military might to smash Hamas's infrastructure, crush its tunnels, and cripple its command and control networks.But it's not clear how much Israel knows about what awaits in Gaza. Hamas's military prowess, including an astonishingly granular understanding of Israeli security that enabled it to outsmart its formidable defences, has shocked Israelis.Hamas is likely to possess the same sophistication when it confronts what it knows will be a ferocious Israeli response.And unlike the Islamic State group, Hamas is also a political and social organisation embedded in Palestinian society.A military onslaught can destroy its metal and concrete but not the mettle of the people whose resolve to die for their cause will only harden.Andrew Parker in the UK asks: What was the goal of the initial Hamas attack?Frank Gardner, our security correspondent, tells us:The reason given at the time by Hamas's spokesman Mohammed Al-Deif was that "enough is enough".The attack, he said, was in response to what Hamas called constant provocations and humiliations suffered by Palestinians at the hands of Israelis in both Gaza and the West Bank.Analysts believe there may have been other, undeclared reasons.Before the attack, Israel and Saudi Arabia were well on the way to normalising ties.This was opposed by both Hamas and its backer, Iran. The Saudis have now suspended those talks.But there will have been more to it than that.Hamas's leadership will have noticed the sharp divisions in Israeli society caused by judicial reforms introduced by the right-wing government of Benjamin Netanyahu.They aimed to deal Israel a painful blow - and in that they succeeded.Diana in the UK, who asks: Muslims speak of the family and brotherhood of Islam. How can Muslims in Egypt justify keeping their border with Gaza closed?Jeremy Bowen, our international editor, reporting from southern Israel says: Islam is a faith but it doesn't necessarily transcend the politics of national security.I'm certain millions of Egyptian Muslims want to alleviate the suffering of civilians in Gaza.But the Egyptian government, even at quiet times, does not allow routine access from Gaza through the Rafah crossing. Egypt has been the junior partner in earlier versions of Israel's siege of Gaza ever since Hamas took over there in 2007.Hamas has its roots in the Muslim Brotherhood, an organisation founded in Egypt a century ago. The Brotherhood wants to reshape states and society in line with Islamic teaching and belief.The Egyptian military opposes that desire. It overthrew an elected Muslim president in 2013.Egypt's current regime has relations with Hamas, and has in the past been the link between Hamas and Israel. But it does not want an influx of Palestinian refugees. The camps in Gaza still exist 75 years after they were established to house refugees - forced out by newly independent Israel - who have never been allowed home.Simon in the UK asks: The world issued an international arrest warrant against Putin. Why has there not been the same response against Hamas leadership? Was this not a war crime on a massive scale?Paul Adams, our world affairs correspondent answers:Israel did not consider itself at war with Hamas before 7 October, despite previous rounds of conflict stretching back many years.For Israel, this was an act of terrorism, not war.Benjamin Netanyahu's government is pursuing justice in its own way and has already killed at least two Hamas commanders it regards as responsible for the massacres.It will doubtless attempt to kill many more.Questions may arise about the organisation's political leadership - which lives in Qatar and Lebanon - who, some say, were unaware of the military wing's plans to attack inside Israel.Sadul Hoque from London asks: If everyone has agreed that Israel has been killing civilians and will kill a lot more in these new strikes, why are the UN and other countries not intervening?James Landale, our diplomatic correspondent gives this answer:The main reason why many countries are not urging Israel to stop its airstrikes is because they accept the country has been attacked by Hamas and has a right to defend itself.Where they are urging restraint is about how Israel defends itself.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said this morning: "I've raised with the Israeli prime minister the need to minimise the impact on civilians as best we can."The United Nations too has urged Israel to avoid civilian casualties.The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said a few days ago: "International humanitarian law and human rights law must be respected and upheld; civilians must be protected and also never used as shields."Israel insists its warplanes and artillery are striking Hamas targets in Gaza. But many civilians are indeed being killed and injured in those strikes.Palestinians say that is because the Israeli strikes are excessive and indiscriminate. Israel says it is because Hamas uses civilians as human shields.An anonymous reader asks: How is it possible that the Israeli military have enough intelligence and surveillance to know exactly where Hamas is stationed in Gaza, but it didn't know Hamas were going to attack Israel or see any warning signs of the attack?Yolande Knell, our Middle East correspondent, in Jerusalem, says:In the past, Israel's military has opened up its control centre for surveillance of Gaza to journalists, and it's clear that it has excellent real-time information about movements on the ground from drones and other cameras.It also has a vast network of informants.We saw in May's fighting with Islamic Jihad just how accurate Israel's information on the whereabouts of leading militants could be.In briefings, Israeli military officials accept there have been major intelligence and security failings when it comes to the unprecedented, deadly attack by Hamas.However, we can rely on the fact that it has an accurate, long list of Hamas targets that it will go after as soon as it gets boots on the ground.Further north from the Gaza Strip, tensions are rising between Lebanon and Israel. One reader wants to know: If Lebanon gets involved, how big a force is Hezbollah compared to Hamas?Hugo Bachega, reporting from southern Lebanon, says:Hezbollah - a Lebanese military, political, and social movement - has long been seen by Israel as a more formidable force than Hamas.The heavily armed Iranian-backed group has an estimated 130,000 rockets and missiles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Most of this arsenal is made up of small, man-portable and unguided surface-to-surface artillery rockets.But it also includes anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as guided missiles capable of striking deep inside Israel.This is much more sophisticated than what Hamas has at its disposal.Hezbollah's leader has claimed to have 100,000 fighters, although independent estimates vary between 20,000 and 50,000. Many are well trained and battle hardened, and have fought in the Syrian civil war.Hamas, by comparison, has an estimated 30,000 fighters, according to Israel.	
16/10/2023 21:17:00	'We are not leaving' - The families who won't evacuate Gaza City - BBC News	Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have left northern Gaza as Israel readies for an expected ground offensive against Hamas. But despite the dangers, many are unwilling or unable to evacuate."I am not leaving my homeland, I will never leave," says 42-year-old Mohamed Ibrahim as he sits in a packed living room.In video footage gathered for BBC Arabic, he is seen surrounded by relatives who have crowded into the home from other areas. Some talk, while others check their phones."I can't flee to another place, even if they are going to destroy our homes above our heads," he adds. "I will remain here".Just over a week ago, Hamas gunmen infiltrated Israel from Gaza, killing more than 1,400 people.Israel has retaliated with air strikes night and day. Thousands of its troops are massed on Gaza's borders, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledging to "demolish Hamas".Mohamed Ibrahim says he and his family have repeatedly moved around the Gaza City area in recent days, responding to warnings of air strikes on this urban centre and Hamas stronghold at the heart of the northern Strip."Last Sunday at 2am, there were attacks and rockets," he says. "I fled with my wife and four kids."The family left their home in Jabalia for an eastern district, but when they heard that area too was going to be targeted they ended up in a suburb of Gaza City.His children are missing their garden, crammed in a flat with their extended family, he says. His son Ahmad cannot contact his best friend, and keeps asking whether he is alive.Israel accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields - which it denies - and of deliberately seeking to hide within the civilian population and infrastructure.The Israeli military has been warning civilians to evacuate north Gaza and head to the south, and many have heeded that call, despite Hamas calls for them to remain.Some 500,000 of the 1.1 million people are said by Israel to have left in the last 48 hours. But Mohamed Ibrahim says he is staying put, because he sees no alternative."We were asked to flee to the south, where should I and my family go?" he asked.Fayez Eltanany another resident of the north who is staying, says: "Anyone who is heading to the south is mistaken." He says he fears that if his family flees, they might never be allowed to return.In the street nearby, Abo Jameel, a 38-year-old builder, crouches on the ground at a pipe connected to the water system, trying to tease out the last drops of liquid.Israel has blocked fuel, water, food and medical supplies from entering the territory and is demanding the release of scores of hostages taken into Gaza by Hamas during its attacks."For eight days there has been no food or water," Abo Jameel says. "No water, no electricity, no life, misery."He has two boys and three girls, the youngest is four. But this family is not evacuating either.Nearly 2,700 people in Gaza have been killed in Israel's retaliatory bombardment. Thousands more have been injured."We have nowhere to go, we are not leaving even if they want to strike our homes," Abo Jameel says. "Where can we go as a family of five or six people?"Despite the dangers, children have still been playing out in the streets in Gaza City.They take advantage of short moments of calm to go out into the alleys and roads to run around. It is an outlet in a life which is now surrounded by war. Almost half of Gaza's population is below the age of 18. The Palestinian Authority says more than 700 children have been killed there in this latest round of conflict already.If Israel does launch a ground assault on north Gaza - and Hamas fighters wage a guerrilla war against them from the buildings and tunnels they have occupied in the area - there could be months of fighting which could lead to destruction of the whole area. Tens of thousands of civilians will be caught in the middle. 	
16/10/2023 19:46:00	Rafah crossing: Thousands of people arrive at Gaza-Egypt border - BBC News	Thousands of people in Gaza have gathered at the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, as diplomatic efforts continue to open it before Israel starts its expected ground operation.But the United Nations said there had been no progress in negotiations on reopening of the crossing.Cairo blames Israel for "not co-operating".All routes out of Gaza are closed, as Israel continues its air strikes in response to Hamas' attack of 7 October.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel on Monday for the second time in less than a week.After his tour of six Arab states in the region, he returned to the country in an attempt to push for the reopening of the crossing to let in humanitarian aid and evacuate foreign passport holders. Both Mr Blinken and UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said they were working with Israel, Egypt and "other leading political voices in the region" to re-open the crossing.The Israeli military ordered a blockade of Gaza and cut off the supply of water, food and fuel last week before launching a wave of air strikes in retaliation to Hamas' deadly attack on Israel during which militants raided communities, kidnapped civilians and soldiers and killed more than 1,400 people.On Monday morning, thousands of civilians rushed to the Rafah crossing following reports that it would be temporarily re-opened during a brief ceasefire on Monday.Both Israel and Hamas swiftly denied that any such agreement had been made. Later, a BBC correspondent in southern Gaza confirmed an air strike had hit the area around the crossing, damaging a building on the Palestinian side of the crossing as well as the road.Video analysed by BBC Verify appeared to show a strike on the crossing on Monday. Israel has hit the area around the Rafah crossing point at least three times since it began its air campaign on Gaza.The crossing represents the only potential exit point from Gaza while the Israeli siege of other entry points to the Hamas-controlled territory continues.Dozens of lorries carrying fuel and aid supplies remain on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing, waiting for permission to enter, as the humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorates.Israel says the siege will not end until Hamas releases the hostages it seized from Israel on 7 October. The Israelis believe 199 people are being held in Gaza, up from an earlier estimate of 155.Around 2,750 people have died in Gaza since the Hamas assault and more than one million people have been displaced."There is an urgent need to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza," Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said on Monday morning, adding that talks with Israel had been fruitless.Cairo has been focusing on getting humanitarian aid for civilians into Gaza. Mr Shoukry said Egypt could allow medical evacuations and let in some Gazans with permission to travel.A number of countries, including the US and the UK, have recommended that its citizens head towards the Rafah crossing, ready for its possible reopening.Although Egypt appears to be prepared to re-open the Rafah crossing to allow foreign passport holders out and humanitarian aid in, it fears a massive influx of Palestinian refugees fleeing the war.Egypt and other Arab states say a this would be unacceptable because it would amount to the expulsion of Palestinians from their land.Are you in the area?

16/10/2023 18:35:00	We are broken, says brother of British Hamas victim - BBC News	The brother of a British man killed while serving in the Israeli military said his brother "wanted to keep his people safe". Nathanel Young was killed near the Gaza border when Hamas launched its deadly attack on 7 October. In his first television interview, Eliot Young told the BBC that the family and friends were "just broken". Six British citizens were killed in the Hamas attacks, and a further 10 are missing, PM Rishi Sunak said on Monday. Nathanel, who was 20 when he was killed, went to Israel two years ago to join the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and "defend his country".  "That was what he always wanted to do," Eliot said. "That's what he was here for. But he ultimately came to live here and raise a family and have a life." Eliot, who grew up in London but now lives in Israel, said of Nathanel: "He just loved life. He had a lot of respect for my parents." He said that he was known among his friends as a DJ because of his love of music.Nathanel's funeral on Monday was interrupted by air raid sirens, with mourners sheltering on the floor. "It was terrifying," Eliot said. "The thing that went through my head is the fact that, even while I'm trying to say goodbye to my brother, they're trying to kill me."He added that his parents had travelled from London to Israel to bury their son "and they had to undergo that". "I don't know exactly how they managed that moment, because I'm sure it was very traumatic for them," he said. Nathanel's parents were very proud of him, Eliot said, before recounting a story about the last time he saw his brother "exactly a week before he was killed". "I think if I look back at that day, I remember his infectious smile... this amazing smile," Eliot said. "Whenever I saw him, I always gave him a huge hug. And I will miss that smile. That hug and those laughs that we had together." When asked how his family will cope with the loss, Eliot said he did not know how to answer. "It's still really raw."But he said the family had received a lot of support since Nathanel's death, and that "hundreds of people" have visited in the last week - on one day three different places delivered them pizza, "which we then had to find a good home for because we had too much". On Monday, Mr Sunak said six British people had been killed in the Hamas attack, and 10 others were still missing. He also called for the immediate release of the 199 people taken hostage by Hamas."We stand with you, we stand with Israel," the prime minister said to the families of some of the missing watching from the public gallery.	
16/10/2023 18:22:00	Israeli fighter follows in father's footsteps - BBC News	Ido Frommer reaches up high to pull a photo album from a book shelf in his home in southern Israel. The spine reads 2005. "Ah, this is it," he says as he begins to leaf through. Some of the pictures show a smiling blond 10-year-old - Ido's son, Avichai. He is photographed on holiday with the rest of the family skiing, or climbing an orange tree, or playing football. In one picture, he is goofing around in a white tutu. "He'll be embarrassed by that photo now," Ido says laughing. I can see in his eyes he's very proud of his son, who is now 28. He is on the verge of being deployed to Gaza with the Israeli Defence Forces to fight Hamas, which is proscribed as a terror organisation by the UK, US and other governments. There's also regret in Ido's eyes. He was himself in the military in Gaza in 2005, and backed then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's decision to pull Israeli troops out of the occupied territory allowing the Palestinians to govern themselves. "It was a mistake what we did. What can I say to those 1,500 people that were murdered last week. It wouldn't have happened if we hadn't withdrawn." I ask him if he feels guilty and his voice cracks as he becomes emotional. "That's a tough word to use," he says. "But maybe it's the right word."Back in 2005, Ido firmly believed things would be different in Gaza. But the following year the Islamists of Hamas won elections in the territory, sparking a brief civil war with their secular Palestinian rivals, Fatah. Hamas eventually took control. The Islamists had never accepted Israel's right to exist, and continued to attack the Jewish state, firing rockets and kidnapping soldiers and civilians.All this as Israel continued to build on occupied land in the West Bank. Israel later put Gaza under a blockade, and launched a number of ground offensives into the territory. After the recent atrocities by Hamas, troops are poised to go into Gaza once again. When Ido and his son Avichai meet later in the day, there are hugs and slaps on the back. Avichai is all grown up now. His girlfriend is beside him, and he has a closely trimmed blond beard to match the full head of hair I saw in the photographs when he was a boy. His work as an engineer is now on hold, as he prepares to go into Gaza. A handgun sits in a holster on his right thigh. "I remember my father being away from home with the air force, but I never felt he had abandoned us. I knew what he was doing was important. "Now what I have to do is important. There is no higher call, no higher meaning in life, than fighting pure evil. In the 20th Century it was the Nazis. Right now it's Muslim extremists. And we have to fight this ideology, for good to win and liberalism to win and for us to continue living the free life that we want to live."The Jewish people were supposed to be safe in Israel. They believed there would be no more mass murder if they lived in their own land, after the unbearable trauma of the Holocaust. That's what helped spur the movement for a Jewish homeland at the end of the World War Two. But the Arab world did not accept the new state, with at least 750,000 Palestinians being forced to flee from their homes. Many ended up as refugees in Gaza, to make way for the new country. The legacy of that struggle for land, is what haunts the present day.In Ido's bookcase is another family album, and as he turns the pages he points to the pictures of faces in black and white, staring out, every single one, murdered by the Nazis. "My father is a Holocaust survivor," he says.  "His whole family was murdered by the Nazis, and we came to Israel and tried to live our life. I've always said what happened back in the 1940s would never happen again. But what we saw last Saturday is very similar. Killing babies, kidnapping people. It's horrible. I'm angry and sad, I'm grieving."As Avichai prepares to go to war, I ask him what his thoughts are for the innocent Palestinians, who had nothing to do with last week's horrific Hamas attacks, but who will inevitably die as Israel attacks Gaza. "When the British people fought the Nazis in World War Two," he says, "they bombed Dresden and Berlin. It's a hard price, but I will not be extorted into losing 1,500 of my people because the other side is more immoral. "If Hamas wants to prevent civilian Palestinian casualties, it must evacuate Gaza."A father and son, joined by blood and now war. Two generations fighting the same on-going conflict. A battle seemingly with no end.	
16/10/2023 18:13:00	Strike on civilian convoy fleeing Gaza: What we know from verified video - BBC News	Warning: This article contains details that some may find distressingReports first emerged on Friday evening of a strike on a convoy of vehicles heading towards southern Gaza. These vehicles were carrying civilians, who were fleeing northern Gaza after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued an evacuation order.Videos showing the carnage at the scene emerged shortly afterwards.BBC Verify has confirmed the strike occurred on Salah-al-Din street, which is one of two evacuation routes from northern Gaza to the south.The Palestinian Health Ministry says 70 people were killed at the scene, and Hamas blamed Israel for the attack. The IDF has told the BBC it had no involvement in the incident. The longest video we have verified is too graphic for us to show. It's a scene of total carnage. Men are seen running, yelling prayers and laments into the smoke-filled air. Sirens and car alarms howl throughout.As the camera moves along the scene, the extent of the devastation becomes clear. Bodies, twisted and mangled, are scattered everywhere.Later, the broken body of a small child - a boy, dressed in shorts and a T-shirt - is seen lying on a truck, his head twisted awkwardly towards the camera.We counted at least 12 dead bodies at the scene. Some of them women and young children.Other footage shows the bodies of victims lying in the street, and vehicles on fire.A number of videos have now emerged on social media showing the immediate aftermath of the strike. Local media reports said the attack took place on Salah al-Din road, a major highway that runs north to south across the strip, and one of just two evacuation routes for civilians living in the north.The road was full of traffic all day on Friday following Israeli warnings to leave the area.Building on work from open source analysts, such as Chris Osieck, we began by verifying the first video that shows the aftermath of the attack. We focused our attention on this 45km-stretch (28 miles) of road, beginning with the north, as that was where the convoy was likely to have set off from.The video had a number of key details - buildings, road markings, signs - that offered clues to the location.Using satellite imagery we looked along this road, searching for areas that matched the details we had seen in the video. We placed the location a few kilometres from the southern outskirts of Gaza City. We performed a reverse-image search on certain keyframes in the footage to ensure that the material was new, and had not been reposted from an older incident.Finally, we used online tools that identify the angle of sunlight and length of shadows to work out that the footage was filmed around 17:30 local time (14:30 GMT) on 13 October.Having established the key details, we were then able to identify common features in other footage claiming to show the incident, including a video shot from about 100 meters away which shows burning vehicles.We spoke to several weapons experts but they said it is hard to tell what caused the explosion based on the videos of the aftermath.Another video was circulating on X (formerly known as Twitter) early on Saturday morning, showing a convoy in Gaza with about 30 people on board.Online software which analyses the angle of shadows tells us the video was likely filmed between 15:30 and 17:20 local time on Friday, before the convoy blast incident.It was filmed close to the location where the aftermath of the strike was recorded, and there were suggestions that it showed the same truck pictured at the scenes with bodies lying across it.However, putting images of the two trucks side by side suggests they are not the same vehicle. The undercarriages are different - with one truck having two rectangular boxes, and the other having one. There are also other visual differences.The IDF says its enemies are trying to prevent civilians leaving the north.BBC Verify will continue to monitor the situation and report any updates.This piece was first published on 15 October and has since been updated.Additional reporting by Rollo Collins and Benedict Garman	
16/10/2023 16:07:00	Israel and Gaza on campus: Tumult at US colleges as two sides dig in - BBC News	A debate over the war between Israel and Hamas is raging on US college campuses. In a social media age that demands people pick a side on divisive issues, is there still space for young Americans to talk to each other?Hundreds of students gathered on the main quad at Columbia University in New York City last week to engage in duelling protests in support of Israel and the Palestinian people - and to condemn the loss of life.Pro-Israel protesters, most of whom were Jewish, draped themselves in white and blue Israeli flags. For much of the event, they remained silent, letting signs with photos of the victims of Hamas' deadly attack speak for them.Across the square, students who supported the Palestinians waved signs declaring "Free Palestine" and "End the Occupation". A female student from Gaza spoke of her mother, trapped by an Israeli blockade.Though the two sides stood just yards apart, the ideological distance between them seemed insurmountably wide, and only grew more pronounced as the evening progressed.One of the leaders of the pro-Palestinian demonstration read aloud an open letter published by two student groups at Columbia just a day after Hamas militants rampaged through a music festival and several Israeli towns, killing at least 1,400 people and taking about 150 hostages.The attack was a "historic moment for the Palestinians of Gaza, who tore through the wall that has been suffocating them in one of the most densely populated areas on Earth"."Despite the odds against them," the speaker continued to read, "Palestinians launched a counter-offensive against their settler-colonial oppressor."To these students, the attack on Israel was an important development in the decades-long fight for Palestinian autonomy. And Israel's response in the days since was another example of its indifference to the suffering of the Palestinian people.More than 2,700 Palestinians in Gaza have died during retaliatory Israeli air strikes, while just over two million people there are trapped by a blockade and cut off from power and clean water.Israeli officials have used extreme language, with Defence Minister Yoan Gallant referring to Hamas militants as "human animals". And the death toll will rise if Israel launches an expected ground offensive.Most of the activists at Thursday's rally would not speak to reporters. But Darializa Avila Chevilier, who graduated from Columbia in 2016 and had come to support the pro-Palestinian protesters, told the BBC: "No-one wants violence. What we are saying is the violence will end when there's justice, and people are living with dignity."The speakers at the rally condemned the loss of all civilian life and held a moment of silence. But they did not make specific mention of the Israeli victims of violence, or the atrocities carried out by Hamas fighters against civilians, including many women and children.The protest's organisers, Students for Justice in Palestine, told the BBC in a statement that they oppose any form of violence against innocent civilians and stand "only for the preservation of life and justice".They went on to question "why an entire nationality—Palestinians—are being made to answer for the actions of [Hamas]".Yet many of their Jewish classmates across the lawn heard something else in those speeches: a dismissal of murders perpetrated against their own religious and ethnic minority, which has also faced persecution."If you are justifying the murder of innocent civilians, you do not understand human rights," one of their posters declared.Columbia University is not alone in reeling from this political divide. Student groups at Harvard University issued a statement which blamed Israel's policies for the massacre of its civilians, which prompted a backlash from powerful alumni.On other campuses across the country, students and schools have received an avalanche of criticism, accused by both sides of either justifying extremism or staying silent in the face of it.These arguments have played out over decades, but the unprecedented scale of the Hamas attack and Israel's military response means tensions and emotions are spiking. The current war is the culmination of a shift over the past two decades which has seen hardliners in power in Israel and Gaza, and the prospect for peace via a two-state solution diminish. "There is a growing gulf, but I think that gulf represents what's going on in Israel and Palestine," said Zachary Lockman, a professor at New York University who teaches a course on the history and politics of the conflict and has witnessed many campus debates over the years.Among students, he said, this translates into "deepening polarisation, and very little common ground". And at colleges and on social media, the debate is often framed as 'They're either with us or against us', he explained.Prof Lockman points out a few trends from the past decade or so that help explain the growing chasm on campus. First, the Palestinian cause has become more of a priority for left-wing groups in the US. Many activists see a link between the renewed focus in America on social justice and structural racism with Israel's blockade of Gaza and presence in the West Bank. In the US, critics of the Israeli government are more likely to see the state of Israel - and especially the expansion of Israeli settlements which most of the international community deems illegal - through the lens of colonialism.Simultaneously, Americans' attitudes towards Israel have shifted along generational lines. Younger people are far more likely to have an unfavourable view of Israel than a favourable one, a July 2022 Pew Research Center poll found. And a partisan divide has opened up as well. For the first time, Democrats are now more likely likely to feel more sympathy for the Palestinian people, according to Gallup polling, while Republicans are more likely to sympathise with Israel. Students who back the Palestinian cause argue that while support for their stance may have grown, they believe that pro-Israel sentiment remains strong among America's political, media and academic establishment.At Thursday's protest, Students for Justice in Palestine condemned Columbia University leadership for not taking a firmer stand in support of the Palestinian people. "I lied to [my mother]," a young woman from Gaza told the crowd, "telling her I was safe at university."Back across the quad, the young Jews who attended the rally in support of Israel said they often found themselves frustrated and alienated by the tone of campus debates."Even in this liberal university, people cannot respect one another," said Lihi Tal, 24, who is studying at Columbia after completing her military service in Israel. "We're feeling lonely here in the university. There are some people who supports us, but I'm afraid to say that I'm a Jew."Other students held strongly partisan stances on the conflict. One Israeli student, Daniel Katz, wandered over to listen to the opposing protest, but found himself unpersuaded. He solely blamed Palestinians for the situation in Gaza before this latest conflict erupted, which human rights groups have called inhumane due to Israel's 16-year blockade."They chose [Hamas] to lead, and they betray their own people," he said, referring to the 2006 election that brought the militant group to power and is the last election held there.The signs held by pro-Israel students on Thursday featured many victims of Hamas' attack, but did not display the casualties in Gaza that have mounted as Israel retaliates. Like their classmates across the lawn, these students also condemned suffering of civilians on both sides, but remained focused on the Israeli and international victims of the terror attack. A few felt that more nuanced views of the war were being drowned out, and worried that the rhetorical battle lines being drawn would not help students gain a better understanding of the conflict - or each other."I think it's very unfortunate, it really saddens me that we're on opposite sides," said Stephanie, a 20-year-old Jewish student from Brooklyn who asked the BBC not to reveal her last name."There's not there's not enough dialogue between these two [groups]. Everything's separate."Stephanie had joined the pro-Israel side, but worried that pro-Palestinian classmates were ignoring or misunderstanding the range of Jewish opinion on Israel and its current right government."People don't recognise that this group…support Jews and support Israel as a safe haven for them," Stephanie said. "But also, there's diversity of opinion, and that people also support Palestinian life and Palestinian safety."Before Thursday's protests, a classmate had approached Stephanie to discuss organising an event where students from opposing sides could talk through the conflict."I do believe there is a chance for that to happen, for people to come together in that way," Stephanie said. "I think right now, it's difficult."	
16/10/2023 15:57:00	Russia returns four Ukrainian children in Qatari deal - BBC News	Russia has agreed to return four Ukrainian children to their families, as part of a deal brokered by Qatar.The youngest is two years old and the oldest is 17.The repatriation is part of a pilot scheme to return more of the thousands of children taken by Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.Ukraine says it has identified 20,000 children who it alleges were abducted by Russia.However the number of those deported is thought to be much higher.The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russia's President Vladimir Putin in March, accusing him and his commissioner for children's rights Maria Lvova-Belova of the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children.Russia insisted that its motives were purely humanitarian, claiming it evacuated hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian children to protect them from danger, with top officials scorning the indictment at the time. The return of the four children will test a scheme worked on by Qatar after it headed talks with Moscow and Kyiv, a diplomat who asked to remain anonymous due to the scheme's sensitivity told news agencies. It is hoped that further repatriations would follow if the first was successful, they added.However, getting the children out of Russia has not been straightforward. In at least one case a child had to travel home via Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. One of the four children to be returned, a seven-year-old, was reunited with his grandmother on Friday and arrived in Ukraine on Monday.The other three children, also reunited with their families, are expected to arrive in Ukraine later on Monday or Tuesday.They are among thousands of Ukrainian children who Kyiv says were forcibly separated from their families, taken across the border into Russia and faced an active effort to strip them of their Ukrainian identity. The BBC has previously found that Ukrainian children in Russia were frequently told there was nothing in their country to return to and were subjected, to varying degrees, to a "patriotic" Russian education.In some cases Ukrainian families have been forced to make gruelling journeys into Russia to get their children back.It is thought that so far only around 400 Ukrainian children have returned before Qatar mediated the four's return."They want to separate children from their biological families, Russify these children, hide these children and transfer them to another ethnic group," Daria Gerasymchuk, an adviser to the Ukrainian president for children's rights and rehabilitation previously told the BBC. However, work to reunite children with their families would continue, Ms Lvova-Belova said in a post on her Telegram channel, quoting President Putin as saying: "We have never been against children being reunited with their families."Russia would also help pay transportation and accommodation costs, and where necessary carry out DNA analysis, she added.Qatari minister Lolwah Al Khater confirmed the mediation in a statement, calling the repatriations "only a first step"."We are encouraged by the commitment and openness shown by both sides throughout the process, which we sincerely hope will lead to more initiatives aimed at de-escalating tensions and building trust between the two parties," she added.	
16/10/2023 14:58:00	Israel evacuates communities near Lebanon border amid fears of escalation - BBC News	Israel's military is evacuating 28 communities near the northern border with Lebanon because of escalating hostilities with Hezbollah militants.An Israeli civilian and a soldier were killed on Sunday, when anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon hit one of the villages and a military post.The military said it struck Hezbollah military sites in response.It also accused the group's backer, Iran, of ordering attacks in an effort to distract Israel from the Gaza war.Iran meanwhile warned Israel of the risk of a regional conflict if it continued attacking the Palestinian territory in retaliation for the deadly assault by the militant group Hamas earlier this month.Hezbollah is Lebanon's most powerful military force and has long-range rockets at its disposal that could strike deep into Israeli territory. It fought a month-long war with Israel in 2006.During a visit to a community co-ordination centre in the northern town of Shlomi on Monday, Israeli government minister Benny Gantz was asked by the BBC whether he thought there would be another war with Hezbollah."I hope for them not, but we do all the preparations," he replied. The IDF announced on Monday morning that it was implementing an emergency plan to evacuate all civilians living up to 2km (1.2 miles) from the Lebanese border and put them up in state-funded guest houses. A spokesman said the evacuation was a precaution to "reduce harm to civilians and enable the IDF freedom of action if it is required".However, several border villages are already three-quarters empty or more.   Residents told the BBC that families had not waited for the official order, packed up their things and taken their children south to safety.In many cases, the only people left in the villages now are soldiers and members of local security teams who stayed behind to help them. The communities are so close to the border that you can see the fortified fence built by Israel along it. In some of them, you can also see the Hezbollah observation posts on the other side.At one point on Sunday, there was intense fighting in several different locations along the frontier, as the IDF and Hezbollah exchanged fire. Israel reported its first civilian death from a Hezbollah strike in the current violence. A man in his 40s was killed in an anti-tank missile attack on the border village of Shtula.Later, an Israeli soldier, Lt Amitai Granot, was killed in another missile attack on a military post, Israeli media reported. In a separate exchange, a rocket hit the headquarters of the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Unifil, in the city of Naqoura. No-one was injured.The IDF said it carried out strikes on Sunday and overnight that targeted Hezbollah military infrastructure.It also reported that nine rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory, five of which were intercepted, and that it struck the launch sites in response.Last Monday, three Israeli soldiers were killed in a confrontation with militants from Palestinian Islamic Jihad who had crossed over the border from Lebanon. Later that day, at least three Hezbollah militants were killed as the IDF attacked sites in Lebanon in response to mortar fire.And on Friday, a Reuters news agency cameraman, Issam Abdallah, was killed by shellfire while reporting near the Lebanese village of Alma al-Shaab. The IDF said it was investigating Lebanon's claim that Israeli troops fired the shell.The IDF has deployed tens of thousands of additional soldiers along the border in the past week, but Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told reporters on Sunday that it had "no interest in a war in the north"."If Hezbollah chooses the path of war, it will pay a very heavy price. Very heavy. But if it restrains itself, we will respect that and keep the situation as it is," he added.Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian meanwhile said his country had conveyed a message to Israel through its allies that "if they do not cease their atrocities in Gaza, Iran cannot simply remain an observer".He also warned that if the "scope of the war" expanded the United States would suffer "significant damages".The US said it was sending a second aircraft carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean Sea on Sunday as part of "deter hostile actions against Israel or any efforts toward widening this war following Hamas's attack".	
16/10/2023 14:57:00	Dariush Mehrjui: Iranian director and wife found dead - BBC News	One of Iran's most prominent film directors, Dariush Mehrjui, has been found dead alongside his wife.The 83-year-old and Vahideh Mohammadifar were found with stab injuries in their home near the capital, Tehran, on Saturday evening, Iranian authorities say.Mehrjui was considered one of the founders of Iranian new wave cinema. Iran's judiciary said seven people have been arrested so far in connection with the killing.Police spokesperson Saeed Montazer-Mehdi said detectives had "reached convincing evidence related to the case".According to chief justice Hossein Fazeli, Mehrjui had invited his daughter to come over to his home in the city of Karaj for dinner on Saturday night.When she arrived, she is said to have found the bodies of her parents.Mohammadifar, a screenwriter and costume designer, had reportedly complained recently that she had been threatened and that the house had been burgled. Iranian actor and director Houman Seyedi was among those who took to social media to react to the killings - describing them as "terrible and brutal".Mehrjui, who studied in the US as a young man and later lived in France for five years, first rose to national and international prominence with his 1969 film The Cow, which tells the story about a villager's obsession with the titular animal. His other most notable films include Hamoun, The Pear Tree and Leila - the latter about an infertile woman who encourages her husband to marry for a second time. The new wave movement focused mainly on realism but Mehrjui was known to draw inspiration from literature. He received many awards over the years but while his films were celebrated at international film festivals, some barely saw the light of day in Iran due to censorship.

15/10/2023 22:41:00	Pro-Palestinian protest attracts thousands in Belfast city centre - BBC News	Thousands of pro-Palestinian protestors have attended a rally in Belfast.Demonstrators gathered at Writers Square on Sunday before marching along Royal Avenue to Belfast City Hall. There were a series of speeches at the event, which lasted about two hours.Similar protests have taken place across the UK over the weekend, including in London, Glasgow, and Manchester.About 100 people also attended a vigil in Belfast in support of Israel.The protests come a week after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel.Fighters from the the Palestinian militant group entered communities near the Gaza Strip, killing at least 1,300 people.About 2,300 people have been killed in Gaza by Israel's retaliatory air strikes and a ground offensive on the region is also expected.About 1.1 million people in the north of Gaza have been told by Israel's military to move to the south, with Israel saying it will allow a safe route for a limited time.But the World Health Organisation (WHO) has criticised the order to move hospital patients from the north, saying it is tantamount to a death sentence.Assembly members Pat Sheehan, of Sinn Féin, and Gerry Caroll, from People Before Profit, were among those to address the crowd. Also present at the event were representatives from the Northern Ireland Council for Racial Equality, ICTU, Unison and the Jews for Palestine group. Some minor scuffles broke out when the march arrived at Belfast City Hall as protestors were met with a small number of pro-Israel supporters. Saeb Shaath's family are in Gaza and have been denied access to water, electricity and fuel, he said."We lost a lot of people, I lost four from my own family," he said. "We thank the people in Belfast here to show their support, but at the same time we feel dismayed by western leaders."This is a war crime what's happening in Gaza, a war crime supported by some British politicians and American politicians."Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin has said that he is "deeply concerned" at the situation in Israel and Gaza. "The decision by the Israeli military to tell the entire civilian population in the north of the Gaza strip to move southward for their own safety is deeply dangerous and impossible to implement," Mr Martin said. "There is no doubt about the brutal criminality of Hamas and their utter disregard for human life, including the lives of their fellow Palestinians, but we absolutely must distinguish between Hamas and Palestinian civilians in Gaza."Mr Martin said that Israel "has a right to defend itself from attack" but it must do so "within the parameters of international humanitarian law".During a meeting in Paris on Sunday evening, the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed cooperation on evacuating citizens from Gaza as it faces the threat of a ground invasion by Israeli forces.Mr Varadkar said that there are about 40 Irish citizens in Gaza who are UN aid workers or dual citizens and arrangements are being made to evacuate them if they want to leave. Irish-Israeli woman, Kim Damti, was killed in last weekend's Hamas attack at a music festival. The 22-year-old was last seen at the Supernova music festival in Re'im in southern Israel last Saturday.  Meanwhile, Tom Hand, who is originally from Dublin, said that his eight-year-old daughter, Emily, had been killed in Hamas' attack on the Kibbutz Be'eri last Saturday. He told broadcaster, CNN, that his daughter had gone to stay at her friend's house in the kibbutz near Gaza last Friday night, and it was two days before he found out that she was dead.At Sunday's vigil for Israel, which was also held at the gates of Belfast City Hall, organiser and director of March of Life UK Mike McNally said that the event was an opportunity to "pray for Israel, and for all the innocent lives that have been lost". He said that it was important to "stand with our Jewish community here", many of whom he said were fearful of anti-Semitic attacks following recent events.Mr McNally said that the conflict is "very sad" and his hope is that "less life is lost" over the coming weeks.	
15/10/2023 19:34:00	One week in Gaza: 'There are no safe places here' - BBC News	Bisan Owda is a 25-year-old filmmaker in Gaza. She's worked with the UN on women's rights issues and with the European Union on climate change. But Bisan's passion is trying to document life in the territory. All week, she's been posting video updates on Instagram about her life under fire. Last Monday - two days after Hamas's unprecedented cross border attack that killed 1,400 in Israel - Bisan like thousands of others received a text message from the Israeli military. It told everyone in the central Rimal district of Gaza City to leave their homes. Bisan quickly grabbed all the possessions she could carry and rushed out of her apartment, filming as she went."We've been told to go to safe areas," she says on camera, then jumping into a taxi. "But there are no safe places in Gaza." Bisan headed to the main Shifa hospital in Gaza City, which is already overwhelmed with casualties but where thousands of Gazans have gone this past week to seek some sort of shelter. Later that night Israel bombed Rimal, hitting what it said were 200 Hamas targets and reducing practically the whole area to rubble. The same day Israel's defence minister, Yoav Gallant, ordered a complete blockade of Gaza with no food, water or fuel to be allowed in. On Wednesday, Bisan posted a video of her opening a bottle of water. "It's the first clean water I have drank for three days," she says with relief.Like many Gazans, she has endured a week of sleepless nights. In one post she tells us about her bedtime routine.She puts her shoes by the door, ready to run. She prepares a small rucksack with a few essentials: clothes, toothbrush and toothpaste, her laptop and of course, her phone. And with mains electricity now cut off, there's also the issue of power. Bisan's family is lucky to have a small generator, she says, which they turn on for just two hours a day. She charges her mobile and her laptop, which she needs to keep working.  But like everyone else in Gaza, they're running out of fuel for the generator. On Friday, Bisan was told she had to move again when the Israeli military ordered more than a million Palestinians living in the north of Gaza to head south.She posted from the ground of Shifa hospital as thousands of tiny white leaflets carrying the warning from Israel fluttered down from sky.  The UN says hundreds of thousands of Gazans have now travelled south, fearing Israel is close to launching a massive ground offensive around Gaza City. But Bisan, along with ten members of her family, is staying put at Shifa hospital. "If we head south, we'll never be able to get back," she told me. Journalists have not been allowed into Gaza since Hamas killed more than 1,300 Israelis last weekend.Communication with people inside is extremely difficult and I've managed only a few snatched conversations with Bisan. But from her video blogs you can build up a picture of her life which has been upturned in just over a week. At the end of one of her Instagram posts Bisan smiles at the camera to her more than 180,000 followers.  "This is my daily routine what's yours?" She then signs off: "Goodnight. Pray for us."	
15/10/2023 18:48:00	Vigil for victims of Hamas attack held in London - BBC News	Hundreds of people have attended a vigil outside the Houses of Parliament to share their "deep sadness" at lives lost following Hamas' attack on Israel.The Palestinian militant group launched an unprecedented attack on 7 October killing at least 1,300 people and taking scores of hostages. More than 2,300 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes.Rabbi Jeremy Gordon said the mood at the London vigil was "very sombre". Noam Sagi, whose mother Ada Sagi was taken hostage by Hamas, was among those to address the vigil.Rabbi Gordon, of the New London Synagogue, said: "[There is] deep anger and deep sadness at the loss of life and also the taking of hostages. "Some 150 people have been taken hostage."He called for their immediate release, particularly the women and children who have been taken.Speaking about Ms Sagi, the Rabbi said: "She is a woman aged 74, a retired headteacher - a teacher of Arabic and Hebrew. "She spent her professional career as someone trying to build peace between Jewish and Arab populations in Israel."Large pro-Palestinian rallies were held in cities across the UK on Saturday. Some at the vigil were draped in Israeli flags with others holding signs with a message to "bring them home"."There has been no hatred," Rabbi Gordon said. "No hatred towards Palestinians, no hatred towards Muslims, no hatred towards Arabs. Just deep sadness at the loss of life."

15/10/2023 14:03:00	Eritrean asylum seekers in Israel: 'Our second country is bleeding' - BBC News	Eritreans who fled their native country for Israel have experienced further displacement following Hamas's surprise attack.Around 18,000 asylum seekers from Eritrea, East Africa, live in Israel.They fled persecution and compulsory military conscription in one of the world's most repressive countries.Following air strike on southern Israel, Eritrean asylum seekers told the BBC about relocating yet again.Teklit said his home was "totally damaged" by a Hamas rocket on Sunday night."God forbid I was able to escape, but I was there, the situation was dire," he said."There had been shelling the whole day. Usually, in such circumstances, we get signals and may evacuate our homes. Unfortunately, there was no signal when that rocket came."Teklit, who has been living in the southern city of Ashkelon for 13 years, said everything of his had been "destroyed".Another Eritrean told the BBC he felt like a "new refugee" after fleeing Ashkelon for the safer city of Netanya."My house is destroyed and I'm displaced, but at least I'm safe and away from the terrible noise for the time being," he told the BBC.He was among several Eritreans who had been displaced by the violence, Berhane Negassi, an Eritrean refugee rights activist living in Jerusalem, told the BBC.Mr Negassi said no Eritrean fatalities had been reported, but he indicated that some asylum seekers were missing."We are working with Israeli security forces, police, army and other government institutions to confirm their whereabouts," said Mr Negassi, who leads the Eritrean New Hope Organisation."Israel is our country and we will not tolerate that our second country is bleeding" - this was the general sentiment from Eritrean asylum seekers, he said.Israel is still reeling from last weekend's surprise attack, which killed more that 1,300. Daily life has been disrupted - schools have been shut and many employees have been ordered not to attend work.Life was a struggle, Mr Negassi said, especially for refugees, who might be "troubled single mothers" or had "health or economic problems".Eritreans and Sudanese began arriving in Israel in 2006, having journeyed through Egypt's Sinai Peninsula in large numbers.Once entering Israel, many spend time in a desert holding centre, waiting for their asylum requests to be considered. In 2020, Israel had granted asylum to less than 0.1% of applications.The war between Israel and Hamas continues - more than more than 2,300 people have been killed in Israel's retaliatory bombing campaign of the Gaza Strip.Israel has also warned 1.1 million Palestinians living in north Gaza to evacuate south, and thousands have been fleeing by vehicle or on foot.	
15/10/2023 12:43:00	BBC journalists held at gunpoint by Israeli police - BBC News	BBC journalists covering the attack on Israel were assaulted and held at gunpoint after they were stopped by police in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.Muhannad Tutunji, Haitham Abudiab and their BBC Arabic team were driving to a hotel on Thursday when their car was intercepted.They were dragged from the vehicle - marked "TV" in red tape - searched and pushed against a wall.A BBC spokesperson said journalists "must be able to report on the conflict in Israel-Gaza freely". Mr Tutunji and Mr Abudiab said they identified themselves as BBC journalists and showed police their press ID cards.While attempting to film the incident, Mr Tutunji said his phone was thrown on the ground and he was struck on the neck."One of our BBC News Arabic teams deployed in Tel Aviv, in a vehicle clearly marked as media, was stopped and assaulted last night by Israeli police. Journalists must be able to report on the conflict in Israel-Gaza freely," a BBC spokesperson said. The Israeli police later said in a statement that "in light of alerts as part of an operational activity" officers noticed "a suspicious vehicle and stopped it for inspection". "During the inspection, the occupants of the vehicle, residents of East Jerusalem, were searched for fear of possession of weapons. "At the end of the inspection and once the suspicion was removed, all the detainees were released at the site. If there is a claim for deviation from protocol one should contact the relevant authorities."The statement added that Israel is at war with "a cruel enemy that is within the territories of the State of Israel" and operates with "cunning methods".Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October, killing at least 1,300 people. More than 2,300 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes.Israel has told those in the north of the Gaza Strip - about 1.1 million people - to relocate to the south of the territory ahead of an expected ground offensive against Hamas.	
15/10/2023 08:46:00	Who's behind Israel-Gaza disinformation and hate online? - BBC News	Social media has been awash with false claims, conspiracy theories and hateful content surrounding what's happening in Israel and Gaza - and questions over whether inauthentic accounts are being used to manipulate the conversation. As violence unfolds on the ground, I've been looking into who is behind this.When I opened up my TikTok For You Page earlier this week, I was met with a video showing a young Israeli woman being taken hostage by Hamas fighters on 7 October. The footage was shocking. When I scrolled through the comments, the reaction was not what I expected. While some were distressed by the post, other users falsely suggested this footage was not what it seemed. They said the woman in it is "not a civilian" but a soldier, or that the clips had been staged to frame Hamas.Some claimed there's no evidence the group have acted violently towards hostages. The clip, which has been verified by the BBC, shows a young woman covered in blood being pushed into a car by armed men. It was filmed on the outskirts of Gaza City in Sheijia. I scrolled through several more videos and posts about hostages on other social media sites and spotted similar comments.Israeli people are subject to compulsory national service - but evidence suggests many of those taken hostage by Hamas are civilians, like the people featured in these videos. The hostages include festival-goers and children.Disinformation is not limited to accounts seeking to undermine violence against hostages, either. Profiles supporting the actions of the Israeli government have also shared misleading and hateful content. One account I came across this weekend shared a video falsely suggesting Palestinian people were faking their injuries in Gaza. The footage was actually from a 2017 report about a makeup artist working on Palestinian films and with charities. All of these claims were not just shocking to me - they affect the wider understanding of what's happening. Successful attempts to distort and confuse the online conversation make it a lot harder to get to the truth of what's unfolding on the ground if you're relying on social media for updates. That can have serious implications for the international community when it comes to investigating allegations of war crimes, providing aid and figuring out what's happening where.Sometimes, the source of these misleading posts is easier to identify. Take, for example, celebrities, like popstar Justin Bieber, who inadvertently shared a post on Instagram asking people to "pray for Israel' - but used images showing the destruction of Gaza by Israeli forces. Several accounts on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a track record of pushing conspiracy theories about crises have amplified misleading posts in what seems to be a bid to either downplay or exaggerate what's happening on the ground. That includes sharing old videos from different wars and footage from video games, which the accounts claim is from the current situation in Israel and Gaza.  Some very active accounts on X sharing pro-Israel content and anti-Muslim posts appear to be based in India and express support for the country's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I want to try to get to the bottom of the profiles whose identities and locations are less obvious.Several of the accounts suggesting that hostages were soldiers rather than civilians seem to belong to real, younger people. They have otherwise shared funny memes or football clips to their profiles. Some have posted pictures with slogans like "Free Palestine". When I message them they tell me they are based in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. For some profiles, whether they're real people is less obvious. A handful have posted about an eclectic mix of political topics; in support of Russian President Putin and the war in Ukraine, as well as about former US President Donald Trump. Several of these accounts are newly set up or have recently become active. In the past, both the Israeli government and Hamas militants have faced accusations of trying to distort online narratives with "bot" networks - inauthentic accounts used to repeatedly push divisive or misleading ideas. According to Cyabra, a company based in Israel that analyses social media, one in five accounts taking part in conversations about the attacks committed by Hamas since 7 October are fake."Fake" in this context can mean they are automatically operated - but others could also be run by real people posing under false identities.The company says they've found approximately 40,000 fake accounts, including on X and TikTok. It says some of these profiles have been spreading misleading claims in support of Hamas and suggesting - for example - that militants were compassionate to hostages in situations where evidence suggests otherwise. That does not rule out the existence of inauthentic pro-Israel accounts, too. There are clues we can use to identify an account as inauthentic. For example, if a profile is newly set up and is suddenly sharing a large amount of divisive, misleading and at times conflicting content. Ultimately, though, determining whether a profile is actually fake and who exactly is behind it is a very difficult task. It requires information from the social media companies that journalists don't often have access to. Social media sites have been widely criticised over the spread of disinformation this week. The EU is investigating X over the possible spread of terrorist and violent content, and hate speech.Former Twitter (X) employees have previously told me how the company is no longer able to protect against state-co-ordinated disinformation following layoffs under new owner Elon Musk.Ray Serrato, who tackled state-sanctioned campaigns at the social media company, told me how his former team was "decimated" after the takeover. According to him, that means a number of key experts who "covered special regions" - including in the Middle East - and whose job it was to deal with specific co-ordinated disinformation operations, are no longer at the company. X has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. The social media site this week said it had removed hundreds of Hamas-affiliated accounts from the platform. In TikTok's Community Guidelines, the company says it has "increased dedicated resources to help prevent violent, hateful, or misleading content on TikTok" in relation to the current situation.The way that disinformation spreads on X, TikTok and other platforms can shape the general public's view of the situation in both Gaza and Israel. That in turn could also put pressure on the politicians making big decisions about what's unfolding.

15/10/2023 07:12:00	London charities help victims in Israel and Gaza - BBC News	In the midst of recent events unfolding in the Middle East, London-based charities are stepping up to deliver aid and support to those facing the crisis.Give It Forward Today (Gift), headquartered in Hendon, north London, is supporting Israelis, and Medical Aid for Palestinians (Map) in Islington is providing aid to Palestinians. Gift said it leapt into action upon hearing of Hamas' attacks on Israel, collecting essentials for those who have had to flee their homes.Shira Joseph, a member of the organisation, told BBC London they were tirelessly working day and night, gathering donated items such as toothbrushes, sleeping bags, food parcels, thermal clothes, and other sleeping materials."We've been blown away by the response. It's been amazing," she said. Rabbi Naftali Schiff, the founder of the charity, said the spontaneous outpouring of support within the local Jewish community, many of whom have friends and family in Israel, allowed them to amass a substantial amount of supplies to be distributed through partner organisations within Israel."The supplies are going to civilians - families who've had to flee their homes, near the Gaza border. Tens of thousands have had to flee, many families have been decimated, with members of the families killed or missing," Mr Schiff said.Meanwhile, Map is providing healthcare assistance to Palestinians living in the occupied Palestinian territories and refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan. The charity's chief executive Melanie Ward told BBC London there had been widespread horror in response to recent events.Map's work involves supporting medical facilities, providing essential supplies, and ensuring the health and wellbeing of those affected by the latest events in Gaza."We are heartened by the response we've had from people across London, from all walks of life, from all faiths," said Ms Ward."When the terrifying situation began to develop, our colleagues on the ground immediately went to the warehouse and released medicines to the hospitals in Gaza. "They released more than £1.3m worth of medical supplies along with mattresses, blankets, and hygiene kits for some of the many, many, many displaced people who are now in Gaza."There are bombs falling around them, some of them have run out of electricity."She said the charity was working to buy all the remaining medical supplies that exist in Gaza and get them to the hospitals "while they still can".Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

14/10/2023 20:17:00	Zaka: The volunteers giving dignity to Israel's dead - BBC News	Warning: This article contains details that some readers may find distressing Behind the tall, barbed-wire gates of a military base in central Israel last week, away from the public eye, soldiers, police officers, and forensics experts were working diligently on a task that was almost impossible to imagine from the outside - the mass identification of the victims of Hamas's murderous attack.Working alongside them late into the night, under the harsh glare of floodlights, was another group, identifiable by their bright yellow vests. They were Zaka, a religious organisation which, since the attack, has been responsible for some of the toughest work taking place in Israel.Zaka's job is to collect every part of the remains of the dead, including their blood, so that they can be buried in accordance with Jewish religious law. The organisation is called on to deal with the most traumatic events, including natural disasters, suicides from buildings, and terrorism.Its members are almost all ultra-orthodox Jews, and they are all volunteers. When Hamas began its rampage through southern Israel last Saturday, Zaka volunteer Baroch Frankel, 28, was observing the Sabbath as usual at his apartment in Bnei Brak, an orthodox city near Tel Aviv where many of the volunteers live. About mid-morning, he heard over his Zaka walkie-talkie that there was some kind of emergency under way. The walkie-talkie was allowed to be on because the Sabbath can be broken for matters of life and death, but it wasn't until sundown that Frankel could look at his phone and he fully understood the scale of the attack. He grabbed his kit, containing body bags, surgical gloves, shoe covers and rags for soaking up blood, and jumped in his car. "I just drove," he said.Zaka was formally established in 1995 but has roots dating back to 1989, when its founder was one of a group of religious volunteers who gathered to recover remains after a suicide attacker seized the wheel of a public bus in Israel and drove it into a ravine. There is no equivalent organisation in the UK, where professional police teams recover human remains. But in Jewish custom, bodies should be collected to the fullest extent possible and all the available remains buried together. The volunteers from Zaka ensure that this is done properly and, as their motto states, with "true grace".At the site of the music festival on Saturday, the volunteers would face a sprawling scene daunting even to them. It was still dark when Frankel arrived, and Israeli soldiers were still exchanging gunfire with Hamas, so he lay on the sand waiting until it was safe. Then he went to work.Zaka volunteers have been working since at all the sites of the attack. They retrieve the bodies in two-hour shifts because the work is so tough. Dealing with the remains of the children was the worst, Frankel said. As he moved from the festival site to a nearby kibbutz on Saturday, the police warned even the Zaka teams - who are widely known to be experienced in this work - that what was inside was difficult to see. Inside, Frankel found burned children, people blown up with grenades and families gunned down in their homes. "You don't understand how many babies, how many burned people I counted," he said. "When I talk to you now I see these images again in front of my eyes."For this work, particularly in this moment, the Zaka volunteers are sometimes praised by people who see them in the street in their yellow vests. Walking through his neighbourhood in Bnei Brak this week, Frankel shrugged off the praise."Zaka is a sacred service because you ask no thanks," he said. "The dead cannot pay you back."On Wednesday evening, the Zaka volunteers had just finished the last of their work collecting remains in southern Israel and Frankel was driving an hour north to the military base where the bodies were being processed.Inside the base, there were about 20 massive cold storage units, like shipping containers, lined up to hold the bodies. The rabbis and Zaka volunteers were doing everything in their power to preserve the dignity of the dead, despite the scale of the operation and the condition of some of the remains. They took care to pause and say prayers over each person, where possible, and the orthodox among the workers gathered every 15 minutes to say their own prayers while the work continued around them.Yacoub Zechariah, 39, the deputy mayor of Frankel's home city of Bnei Brak, was on his fifth straight overnight shift for Zaka at the base. "Physically, it's hours upon hours without sleep and carrying corpses is hard work," he said. "But we overcome it."Zechariah, a father of five, had seen bodies of children brought in with terrible injuries and burns, he said. Some had been decapitated, although it was not clear how. Some of the dead children had their hands and feet tied with phone cables. Zechariah pulled a body bag from a truck with a family name written on it in marker. The next bag had the same name, and the next. Eventually he had pulled five members of the same family from the truck. They were two parents and three young children who had been murdered by Hamas in their home in the kibbutz in Kfar Azza."Seeing an entire family killed is something that breaks a human being," Zechariah said. "I have five children of my own. We are people of faith and we know that everything comes from God, but this is difficult for us to understand."When Zechariah had checked the faces of the family and they had been moved into storage, he walked to the edge of the area where the bodies were being processed and wept. A few hours later, at 5am, he finished his shift and sat quietly in his car to drink a coffee and smoke a cigarette. Then he drove half an hour home to his family in Bnei Brak, slept for two hours and drove to City Hall to begin his day as deputy mayor.Outside the gates at the base, away from the horrors inside, family members of the dead were camped on lawn chairs on the roadside, supported by food trucks and donations from local residents. Ortal Asulin had been sleeping on the roadside since she first learned on Saturday that her brother, a famous ex-footballer called Lior Asulin, had been caught up in the attack. "No one will give us answers, it is a big mess inside," she said, looking totally shattered. "We go to ask every five minutes, everyone here knows us, our names, our phone number, my brother's name, and his picture. He was a famous footballer, only one person needs to see him inside there to know it is him."At that moment, Frankel overheard her and recognised her brother's name. "I saw him," Frankel said. "I saw his face, I'm sure." Ortal crumpled onto the pavement in tears. The rest of the family rushed around Frankel as he tried in vain to reach a colleague inside to confirm that Lior had been seen. The police said they had no information and they would not let the family inside. "It is not possible to locate the body at the moment," said a tired but kind police sergeant. "In the end they will remove it, they are doing everything they can but they must be given some time."Many similar conversations had been had outside the base, said the police sergeant, who was not permitted to give her name. "There are a lot of dead people inside and we need to make sure 100% sure that we have the correct person before we tell the family," she said. "We are five days now after the event and this has an effect on the bodies, you understand? We cannot have any mistakes."For Jewish people, a delay in burying a body can add enormous pain to the loss. They believe that a person should be buried as soon as possible so that their soul can rise up to heaven. And until the dead are buried, the family cannot begin formally to grieve. Like the soul of the person who has died, they are in limbo.Lior Asulin, the football player, was finally identified and buried on Thursday. Zaka is also involved in these final stages of the process. Many of the bodies go from the military base to a Zaka-run centre in Tel Aviv, where on Thursday volunteer Israel Hasid was painstakingly preparing to receive them. He expected that the work would continue around the clock and through the weekend, so he had sought special permission from a rabbi to work on the Sabbath.There will be some police presence at the centre for technical exams involving DNA and dental records, but otherwise Hasid and the other Zaka Tel Aviv volunteers will take responsibility for all of the purification necessary before burial. They will wash the bodies in water taken from a river that runs alongside the building and gently clean them with cotton. They will cut their hair and nails if needed. "In these circumstances, because of the nature of this attack, in many cases the job cannot be perfect," Hasid said. "But we will do everything we can."At the end of the process, the Zaka volunteers would wrap each person's remains carefully in a white linen sheet and pass them on to undertakers to be buried, he said, so that the souls of the dead could escape and their families could begin to grieve.Idan Ben Ari contributed to this report.

14/10/2023 19:34:00	'I don't eat or sleep' says husband of new mother missing after Hamas attacks - BBC News	Last Sunday morning, Celine Ben David Nagar should have been getting ready for her first day back at work after six happy months on maternity leave.Instead, she was thought to be somewhere inside Gaza, in the hands of Hamas, and her family was 24 hours into a nightmare that is now a week long.Celine, 32, had set out early on Saturday morning with two friends to attend the Nova music festival in southern Israel, but they turned back when they heard rockets ahead.The group found their way to a public bomb shelter near Sderot and hid. It was from there, at 07:11, that Celine sent her final message to Ido, her husband and the father of their baby daughter, Ellie. "Soldiers are coming," Celine wrote. "God, it was a mistake to come here."Ido sped south towards the site on Saturday but the military wouldn't let him pass. On Sunday morning, he found Celine's car, pockmarked with bullet holes but otherwise as she had left it.Later that day, Ido found a survivor who told him that the Hamas militants had thrown grenades into the shelter, killing Celine's friends. But Celine had survived, the stranger said.In the six days since, it has been all Ido has to hang on to. The only other thing he knows is that her body has not been found."You don't sleep and you don't eat and you are in a kind of crazed uncertainty," he said, in a phone interview from his home near Tel Aviv. "You are totally helpless."Ido broke down in tears as he tried to describe his wife, an administrative assistant at the law firm where he works, who grew up in France and is a French-Israeli citizen."She is an amazing woman, a person who is surrounded by friends and love," he said. "And she is an amazing mother. We have a six-month old baby. This was supposed to be her one last party to enjoy before she returned to work. We agreed that I would pick her up at midnight, but she never came home."The community has rallied around him, with friends and relatives bringing food and milk to feed Ellie, who Celine was breastfeeding, and to help take care of her.Much of Ido's time is taken up with the effort to highlight the plight of the hostages. He is in a WhatsApp group with other relatives, where they share information. Little is known about the location or condition of the roughly 150 hostages believed to have been taken into Gaza. They were seized from towns along the Israel-Gaza border as well as from military bases in the area, and they include children and babies, elderly people and people with disabilities.Hamas said it had hidden the hostages in "safe places and tunnels", but has threatened to kill them if civilian homes are bombed by Israel without warning.For Ido and the hundreds of other close relatives, it is a nightmare from which they cannot wake up. "I try to fight it in every way I can think of, I try to be optimistic and I try to think positive thoughts," he said, through the tears."I want to believe that she is alive there, in Gaza, and maybe she is taking care of the children who were kidnapped with her. "I just hope that she knows that we are fighting for her, and that she is telling herself she will come home." Idan Ben Ari contributed to this report.

13/10/2023 19:43:00	Israel-Gaza conflict proves treacherous ground for US politicians - BBC News	In the days immediately after the Hamas attack on Israel, the Republicans seeking the US presidency had focused their criticism on President Joe Biden and what they saw as American weakness and missteps that had paved the way for violence.That changed on Wednesday night, however, when Donald Trump addressed the topic in a speech near his home in West Palm Beach, Florida.Now some of Mr Trump's rivals are condemning the former president in some of the most direct language of this campaign. During remarks to a crowd of supporters, Mr Trump said Israel had to "straighten it out because they're fighting, potentially a very big force".He called Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant a "jerk" and repeatedly called Hezbollah, the militant Islamist group in Lebanon, "very smart".Mr Trump also said that Israel had initially agreed to work with the US on a 2020 drone strike that killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani, but that they backed out at the last minute."I'll never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down," he said. "That was a very terrible thing."In a television interview that aired Thursday, he went further in his criticism of the Israeli prime minister, saying Mr Netanyahu was "not very prepared" for the possibility of a Hamas attack.Mr Trump's remarks prompted a series of quick and pointed responses from Ron DeSantis, the candidate who once was in a dead heat with the former president but now trails him in most polls by a wide margin."Terrorists have murdered at least 1,200 Israelis and 22 Americans and are holding more hostage," the Florida governor wrote in a social media post, "so it is absurd that anyone, much less someone running for president, would choose now to attack our friend and ally, Israel, much less praise Hezbollah terrorists."A DeSantis campaign spokesperson would later call Mr Trump's remarks "disturbing and disqualifying".Mr Trump's former vice-president, Mike Pence, noted a pattern in his old boss's foreign policy statements."Hezbollah aren't smart, they're evil," he said in a radio interview on Thursday."But the former president also said when Russia invaded Ukraine in a similar, unprovoked, unconscionable invasion a year-and-a-half ago, he said Vladimir Putin was a genius."The former president's campaign team on Thursday attempted to explain Mr Trump's comments in a social media post on Thursday, writing, "smart does not equal good" - an effort the DeSantis campaign called "rhetorical gymnastics".Mr Trump's comments also prompted a response from Israeli communications minister Shlomo Karhi, who called it "shameful"."A former US president abets propaganda and disseminates things that wound the spirit of Israel's fighters and its citizens," he said on Israeli television."We don't have to bother with him and the nonsense he spouts."During his presidency, Mr Trump was a vocal and aggressive supporter of Israel and its right-wing Likud government.In 2018, he relocated the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in a move that past US leaders had been reluctant to make because of diplomatic blowback.It won him an outpouring of support from many Israelis.But he has harboured a grudge against Mr Netanyahu since the 2020 US presidential election, when the Israeli prime minister called to congratulate Mr Biden on his victory while Mr Trump was still contesting the voting results. It's yet another indication that for Mr Trump, his foreign policy views and statements can be determined as much by personal issues as political ones.Democrats are facing their own divisions on the topic, as sympathies towards the Palestinian situation that have grown more pronounced in recent years clash with an outpouring of support and anger over the Hamas attacks. Within the left-wing progressive movement, cracks have been forming.Two liberal House Democrats in Michigan, Rashida Tlaib and Shri Thanedar, clashed over the latter's criticism of members of Congress who call Hamas "resistance" or "militants".Ms Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, said Mr Thanedar was more interested in generating social media attention than helping his constituents.Earlier this week, some House Democrats exchanged heated words behind closed doors over the Israel attacks, reportedly after Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey said that anyone in Congress who hasn't condemned the attack should feel guilty.Mr Trump isn't the only Republican presidential hopeful who has discovered that the Hamas attack on Israel can be somewhat treacherous political ground, either.Mr DeSantis himself was put on the defensive while campaigning in New Hampshire on Thursday, as a voter wondered why the Florida governor was not also expressing sympathy for Palestinian civilians who have been killed by Israeli bombing campaigns."They are not decapitating babies' heads," Mr DeSantis said, in reference to unconfirmed reports of specific Hamas atrocities on Saturday. "They are not intentionally doing that."The man, who said he had voted for Mr Trump in the past, told Mr DeSantis he had lost his support.Meanwhile, Vivek Ramaswamy - the tech entrepreneur and political novice who is currently close to Mr DeSantis in recent Republican polls - instigated his own round of criticism when he said that the many Republicans expressing support for Israel after the Hamas attack were engaging in "selective moral outrage" based on campaign contributions and deep-pocketed donors. "It is shameful," he said. "And I think that there are, frankly, financial and corrupting influences that lead them exactly to speak the way they do, that's just the hard truth."That prompted a back-and-forth on social media with Republican congressman Dan Crenshaw of Texas, who called Mr Ramaswamy a "Hamas apologist" and a "clown".The Republican race has been remarkably stable over recent months, as Mr Trump has built and maintained a sizable lead over his opponents through a variety of legal and political drama.The conflict in Israel, however, has created a new turbulence in US and global politics that could continue to cause headaches for Democrats - and, possibly, give Mr Trump's rivals an opening to exploit.	
13/10/2023 18:04:00	'I wake up and check if my family in Gaza is still alive,' says Palestinian American - BBC News	Dorgham Abusalim has not heard from his parents in Gaza for days. The wait is "absolutely horrifying", he says.Since he last spoke to them on Tuesday, Dorgham has been glued to the television, watching the Israeli bombing of Gaza, and watching the death toll climb.On Whatsapp, he learned of one family in Deir al-Balah that lost 20 relatives in a single night. "That's my family's neighbourhood," he tells the BBC from his home in Washington DC.He is one of many Palestinian-Americans whose days are now marked by sporadic, anxious messages and calls with family and friends thousands of miles away.More than 1,500 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the strikes began, in retaliation for the killing of 1,300 people and kidnapping of about 150 people in Israel by Hamas militants.About 2.2 million people live in the territory, which is controlled by Hamas. On Thursday night, Israel told everyone in the north - about 1.1 million people - to relocate to the south within 24 hours. "Any place from which Hamas operates will turn into rubble," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said. For Dorgham, 34, witnessing the war unfold from afar is terrifying and paralysing. He says he is keenly aware that any goodbye may well be the last."I can't go to bed without wanting to hear their voice," Dorgham says of his parents. "I'm going to continue calling and calling until I get through."Israel turned off the water, energy and gas to Gaza on Saturday, and the United Nations has warned of a humanitarian disaster as hospitals run short on fuel and people struggle to store food. As the electricity supplies dwindle, so do Dorgham's chances of hearing his mother's voice."Their electricity has gone down from four hours to two hours to one hour a day," Dorgham says, adding that his family are scrambling every day to find fuel."Some of my family are fleeing south," he says, "but many are staying for fear they will never be able to return to their homes."Tariq Luthun, a 32-year-old Palestinian-American living in Detroit, Michigan, says his extended family in Gaza does not have power, so is trying to use their phones sparingly."They are safe as of this interview, or as of this moment," Tariq tells the BBC, but he says he worries about them constantly."Every day I wake up, I check to see if family members are alive," he says. "Then I go to work. After I log off work, I check again to see if my family members are still alive." The stress of this routine is taking an emotional toll. "I'm really devastated. It weighs on me."Palestinian-Americans who spoke to the BBC say they feel the plight of civilians in Gaza is being forgotten as the majority of US politicians declare their support for Israel.In a speech on Tuesday, President Joe Biden said Israel had a right and duty to respond to the attacks. He was careful to say that Hamas "does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination", but his speech was seen by many analysts as giving a green light to Israel to proceed with a full-scale ground operation, which would likely result in more civilian deaths."In the past you'd see the both-sides-ism," Tariq says. "You don't see that here."Dorgham says harsh rhetoric from politicians in Israel and the US - like Republican Senator Lindsey Graham suggesting that Israel "level the place" - makes him feel hopeless. "It feels to me that we live in a world that categorically hates us. Why?"Iman Kishawi, who was born in Gaza in 1958 but fled because of war when she was seven years old, says she worries constantly about her aunts and cousins who are still there. "I don't know what to do," she says from her home in Los Angeles, describing how she paces back and forth around the house. "They don't have phones. They don't have electricity. They are under constant bombardment."She relies on updates from other relatives in the US who have been able to get in touch with her cousins. Speaking to them brings back memories of her childhood in Gaza, she says, including trips to the beach, where dozens of relatives would gather for family picnics. "The sea was beautiful. Really, really beautiful," she says.Such moments of nostalgia offer only a brief respite from the daily worry that her cousins could be victims of the next bomb strike.She's been told they are OK, for now. "When my cousin says OK, it means this second we're OK," she explains. "They don't know what's going to happen next."	
13/10/2023 17:59:00	Hamas attack on Israel kibbutz Be’eri captured by mothers’ WhatsApp group - BBC News	"God Forbid."Shortly after sunrise on the morning of Saturday 7 October, a message pings on 200 phones of the Be'eri mothers' WhatsApp group.Minutes later another message lands: "We have a terrorist on the stairs. Call someone."WARNING: Some readers may find details in this article distressing.Hamas gunmen had just begun a day-long rampage through this kibbutz in southern Israel, and over the next 20 hours the women channelled their horror, disbelief and reassurances through the chat - as militants roamed the neighbourhood shooting residents dead and setting fire to homes.Hiding in their safe rooms these women - some huddled with their families - described the shouts and explosions they heard outside, told each other where gunmen were, shared tips on coping with smoke that filled their rooms, and repeatedly called for help. In some cases, that help never came.As the hours ticked by, they asked questions. Where was the army? Why was help taking so long? Can somebody please look for my mother? How do I lock my safe room? Should we open the door to a man claiming to be a soldier?At some point, somebody changed the name of the group to "Be'eri Mothers Emergency".This group chat was shared with the BBC by a woman put forward by the community to speak to the media in the wake of the attacks. She is one of the mothers on the chat and shared the details with us so we could see how the terror of the day unfolded - and what a lifeline these women were in the most desperate and sometimes final hours of their lives.We could not seek the permission of all 200 members, but three of them agreed to tell us their stories in detail, and we have anonymised all other exchanges, being careful to ensure nobody can be identified to protect their privacy.Some members are unaccounted for, presumed dead or missing. Survivors estimate that about 100 people were killed and many were taken away as hostages. Minute-by-minute, this chat reveals in detail not seen before how Hamas stalked, murdered and burned people in their own homes, coming back again and again. It is an insight into what it felt like across southern Israel as Hamas gunmen crashed across the border and tore through dozens of communities.It shows how residents survived and supported one another - but it also documents, hour by hour, their growing desperation, as it became clear they would not be rescued by the Israeli state anytime soon.Dafna Gerster, 39, was visiting from Germany and had spent Friday night with family in the kibbutz she grew up in. They had gathered at her father's house, playing the board game Camel Up into the night - and then she and her husband slept at her brother's apartment nearby knowing the next day was Saturday, the Jewish day of rest, when the families could be together again.The community is next to the Gaza border and is used to missiles - but when Dafna awoke to the scream of rockets at 06:30, she knew immediately that something was different. "Usually you have an alarm and a boom of the iron dome [Israel's missile defence system]. This time, there was no alarm, and it was so loud. It's a sound we could not identify."I went to my brother's room and asked him 'what is this?'"Like others in the kibbutz they rushed to the safe room or mamad - a room made of reinforced concrete with airtight steel doors and windows designed to withstand rocket attacks.But it soon became clear that rockets were not the only threat. News spread on the WhatsApp group that someone had been shot - and that there were armed men in the streets.CCTV footage verified by the BBC shows a small group of Hamas militants arriving at the gate of the kibbutz before 06:00. A car arrives, the gate opens, and the militants run inside after shooting dead the occupants of the vehicle. Video from a few minutes later shows the same two Hamas militants walking through a square, guns by their side.Fast forward to 07:10, as the first messages on the WhatsApp group are being shared. Video shows three motorbikes, each carrying two heavily armed Hamas militants, leaving the area by the same gate.Other footage, which is too graphic to include here, shows militants in the kibbutz at 09:05 - three hours after first entering. It shows the same car that was shot at in the first clip with at least one body dragged out, lying in the road.Across the kibbutz, as the community collectively barricaded themselves into their own mamads, a rising sense of dread on the chat preceded a horrible realisation: many people were struggling to lock their safe room doors."How do you do an emergency lock? And how do we know that it is really locked?" one asked."Can you lock the safe room?" asked another."To missiles yes, not to terrorists."Pictures shared on the WhatsApp group offered tutorials on locking the doors. Those who couldn't feared Hamas would just walk in.At the house of Michal Pinyan, 44, her husband had run out of the safe room to lock the front of the house. The family heard shouting in Arabic outside, followed by gunshots.After rushing back to the safe room, Michal's husband built a locking device with ropes and a baseball bat, which he gripped for the almost 19 hours they spent in the room.In the terrified silence of these safe rooms, where people would not dare scream, they typed frantically. Michal watched the messages stream in.They could not hear what was going on outside except via muffled sounds through the thick walls. But from what little they could make out, they collectively tried to understand what was going on.They shared messages of "frantic knocking" on their doors as gunmen went house to house."Not knocking - it's gunfire," one said.During the first hour of the attack, people would tell the group they could hear shooting in their neighbourhood, or outside a particular house. The replies inevitably poured in: "So do we." "We understood it wasn't just one terrorist, it was a massive attack," Michal says. "In each neighbourhood of the kibbutz we heard 'they're here, they're here' so they were in each neighbourhood at the same time."As the scale of the assault became clear, frustrated, fearful posts flooded the chat asking when the army was arriving - and why it wasn't there already."You can hear shooting close by. Hoping it's the first response squad firing," one woman wrote, referring to a small unit in the kibbutz that responds to intruder alerts before handing over to the military.Dafna's brother, Eitan Hadad, was part of that unit and rushed to help, leaving the couple in the safe room. It would be the last time she saw him."He went out and we stayed in the safe room and it was just horror," she says."You didn't know what was going on, you just hear shooting all the time, bombs, a fight. And it doesn't stop for a minute."The response unit of roughly 10 people was clearly no match for the Hamas militants.On WhatsApp, people reported more and more gunshots - and men speaking Arabic outside. The desperate pleas for help became more frequent."I'm home alone and I'm really scared," one resident wrote.Elsewhere in the kibbutz, Shir Gutentag was trying to quietly comfort her eight-year-old and five-year-old daughters, while following the WhatsApp chat in disbelief."At first when I realised we have terrorists in the kibbutz I shook. I was in shock. But very quickly I thought to myself 'you have to stay calm', because they're looking at me, my children, and they see my reactions and they're starting to panic," she says. "So I told them it's OK. It's going to be OK."Hours had passed since the attack started, and the crisis was only worsening. Hamas were breaking into people's homes and threatening safe rooms as members of the chat begged for help.Michal was reading these pleas for help while also messaging her own family in a separate WhatsApp group. She shared the contents of this group with the BBC, giving a terrifying insight into one family's despair as they detailed the Hamas attack in real-time.At around 09:30, Michal's mum wrote on the family chat that she could hear voices in Arabic outside their house. Within 15 minutes another message confirmed that Michal's dad had been hurt.Michal, who had been trying to stay silent in her safe room until this point, simply could not keep quiet anymore and rang her mother. Her mum picked up the phone and whispered."'They're here, they shot Dad, he's not OK.' "And then she hung up,'" Michal says.Her mother continued writing on the family chat: "Help. Help."Hamas gunmen had used a weapon to break through the safe room door and had shot Michal's father as he tried to fight back. They then threw grenades.Her mum wrote a final plea for help at 10:15. After that, messages from her children went unanswered. She had been killed too. As her parents were being attacked, Michal was desperately messaging in the mothers' chat, calling for someone to help  them. She would continue posting messages about them throughout the day hoping that, somehow, they had survived. She was not the only one. Others were continuously begging for someone, anyone, to check on their parents, friends, cousins. But nobody could: everyone was in the same situation, barricaded in their own mamads.Guns and grenades were Hamas' weapons, but they also set homes on fire. "The entire house is smoke," one resident wrote. "What should I do… tell me what to do.""We have a fire inside the safe room", "The entire window of the safe room is black", other messages read.On the row of houses closest to Gaza, the home of Dafna's disabled dad, Meir Hadad, was being burned down.In their own family chat, Meir's Filipina carer, 52-year-old Bhing Sol, pleaded with his children to find help."They're here," she wrote, referring to Hamas, in a message at 09:44."It was full of terrorists," Bhing later said, saying they looted the home before setting it on fire."The safe room was full of smoke. I keep on asking everyone to help us because maybe we'll be burnt alive. But nobody could help us because everyone is terrified."In the mothers' group, others also asked for help to be sent to Meir.With little anybody could do to answer all these pleas they offered each other practical suggestions - small, homespun survival tips that sustained them, and perhaps even saved lives, in their most powerless moment.This was the spirit of the WhatsApp group - not just today, but for the years it had existed. It was a place for mothers to vent, to give advice, to support one another."Entire house is full of smoke what should I do?" someone asked. "Try to put a wet cloth on your face. Or urine," another resident responded.In another exchange, a resident wrote: "I can't breathe in the house I think there's a fire here help urgently"."Stay in the safe room don't go out put a piece of cloth on your nose," a neighbour replied.While 44-year-old Golan Abidbol's wife and children took shelter in the family's safe room, he stood with a gun in his kitchen, watching Hamas militants throw a molotov cocktail at another building. As he watched, he saw a family jump from the second-floor window and hurry to a neighbour's safe room."I was pumped up with adrenaline. If someone came to my house I would give them the fight of my life," he says."I sent pictures to the neighbour downstairs because his house started to burn. I told him: 'Now. I don't see anyone. It's a good time.' So he moved to another neighbour's shelter."Golan says this is the "essence of the kibbutz"."We are one big family. If we need to open our door when there are terrorists outside and let the neighbours get in so they can survive, we will do it. No one even hesitated," he says.At around midday, two or three men tried to enter Golan's house. He pulled the trigger. "They returned a burst of fire on the house and then they left. I don't know why they decided to do it but they decided to leave and not engage me anymore," he says.At the same time, harrowing messages in the group continued to show that Hamas were breaking into houses and trying to breach safe rooms. "Firing at our safe room's door," one message read. "Helppp. Anyone."Meanwhile, at the burning house of Bhing Sol and Meir Hadad, gunmen had begun shooting at the safe room as it filled with smoke."I took a risk - I opened the window of the safe room, thinking even a little bit of space and the air will come," Bhing says."They kept bombing, with a grenade or something, inside our house. I knew it was burning because the door was so hot it was like fire. But I kept holding the door with a blanket because I didn't know if they could open the door," she says. Later in the day, in what Bhing describes as a miracle, a crack formed in the ceiling of the room and water started dripping through onto Meir's head. She grabbed his cheeks in joy after the first drops fell and rubbed her hands over her face.As they waited, the pair could hear hostages being taken past them towards Gaza."I heard so many people that they brought outside, then I heard shouting, and then Hamas was laughing and rejoicing that they got someone," Bhing says.The first reference on the mothers' chat to someone being kidnapped was at 12:09.The BBC has verified footage taken on the day that shows Hamas militants leading five hostages, including an elderly woman, down the road in Be'eri kibbutz - we do not know what time this footage was taken. Israel says that in total 150 people have been kidnapped and taken to Gaza and it is unclear how many were taken from Be'eri kibbutz.As some people were led away by Hamas, others wondered when the army would arrive.Shir Gutentag was reading the messages, while trying to comfort her daughters by continually placing a hand on each of them."I heard voice messages of terrible things," she says. "There was a woman saying her baby daughter was dead. She was crying for help. Another one saw her mother getting killed, and she's waiting in the safe room for many hours whispering for help saying 'save me, I don't want to die.'" Other WhatsApp messages in the group tell of horrific injuries - including a family member bleeding from a massive wound. There are many messages on this chat, including some describing injuries, but we have not been able to ascertain the fate of everyone who posted.As they sat waiting in the safe rooms for Israeli soldiers to arrive, the residents continued to support one another.Shir made quiet calls to neighbours who had posted messages showing they were in distress, saying "breathe in with me"."I posted mainly encouraging things - I'm sure the army's there, I'm sure they're coming. Be patient. Breathe," she says.Others in the group did the same.In one exchange, someone asked: "Is there something someone can say to calm us down?" Within seconds a neighbour responded: "I'll tell you," before describing how the army would be able to handle it.At around 15:00, Shir got a call from neighbours asking to come into her home because theirs was filling with smoke. She rushed over to her front door, and began dismantling a stack of furniture she had put against it to stop anyone entering and let the family of four through, ushering them to the safe room before reassembling the barricade. A few minutes later, another woman got in touch to ask to enter and Shir began the process again.As her family waited for a rescue they weren't sure would happen, Michal said she put her hands on her three children and "gave them little kisses, but quietly".A message on the WhatsApp group offered advice about how to keep children calm. The message said that fear is normal, and to calm children with a hug.In the afternoon, updates shared in the group suggested that IDF soldiers had arrived, and were beginning to make headway. "The soldiers are now fighting... Two other forces are on their way," one message just after 15:30 said.People continued to post their addresses in the hope that someone would come to save them, adding brief information, such as "terrorists hiding".But confusion continued to dominate and nobody seemed to know how many soldiers had arrived, or if they were an organised group who could begin to control the situation. People reported hearing shouts of "IDF, IDF!" outside, but did not know whether this could be trusted. It could be Hamas in disguise, trying to tempt residents to open up.Golan had continued standing with his gun in his kitchen and he said he could see militants with RPGs  shouting "IDF, IDF." "I text my neighbours saying I didn't think it was IDF, they had an accent and they didn't dress appropriately - they wore the uniforms, but they didn't wear them right."This message was also being passed around in the group."They're also disguised as soldiers, do not answer anyone outside," one said.As evening approached, messages became more hopeful. The sounds people were hearing from the safe rooms were shifting. Many were hearing more Hebrew voices.They had been waiting for almost an entire day for help. In one of the first messages on the chat one member says people should not worry and that they didn't need the army - it would be all over soon. But a few minutes later, people were begging for soldiers to come.Now that help had finally arrived, residents tried to coordinate with soldiers, calling out locations for IDF troops to be sent to fight.Shortly before 18:00, a message was circulated saying the most senior forces in the army were handling the incident. "Until now you were brave and amazing, keep staying in the safe rooms and the incident will end. Everyone is aware of the situation and information is coming through all the time."It was around this time that Bhing and Meir were rescued from their safe room. The house around them - where the family were playing board games the night before - was now ashes. Somehow, they had survived, trapped inside a tiny room as all their belongings burned.Bhing turned as soldiers escorted them away, and took a photo on her phone of the remains.Back in the group, a message was sent at 18:08 saying: "They're beginning a process of evacuation." This was followed by the first messages from people saying they had been saved.But the process was slow. Many continued to plead for help long into the evening. "Lots of bullets here too. It doesn't stop. Please they're here," one message just after 19:00 said.The military arrived at Dafna's brother's apartment at 20:00, telling Dafna and her husband they would be rescued within an hour.Members of the mothers' group began sharing code words the soldiers should say so residents could trust it was really them. People continued to worry that it was really Hamas trying to get into their homes. Meanwhile, the sounds of gun battles continued. They were being told it was over but as they had spent a day seeing nothing but hearing everything, they felt they could not distinguish anything or trust anybody. "They're not saying the code help us," one resident wrote.When the military came to Michal's home, she initially refused to open the door. One of the people from the kibbutz's emergency call-up unit called Michal's husband to assure him it really was the IDF."They told him they're going to come back and they're going to shout. And he said tell them to shout our name and we will open," Michal says.The soldiers formed a circle around the family and their pet dog, as they escorted them from the kibbutz."They told us 'we're going to go quiet and at some point you've got to cover your kids' eyes because there are a lot of bodies outside'."So we walked, with the dog and he was really, really quiet. It took us I think 15 minutes to get outside of the kibbutz where they gathered all the people. The soldiers came to each family like this, so it took a lot of time."She covered her children's eyes,  but Michal kept hers open."I wanted to look. I saw bodies. My husband said he saw bodies of people from the kibbutz, but I saw bodies of terrorists," she says.Others couldn't bear seeing the remains of their community. "I was looking down," says Shir. "I think this saved my soul."As they waited to be taken away, a gunman opened fire nearby. It wasn't completely over.The residents were brought on army trucks to a nearby town, before being moved on to a hotel at the Dead Sea.Dafna, who had first seen the military at 20:00, wasn't rescued until after 01:00. She had spent the past 19 hours in such a heightened state of stress and horror that she had not worried too much about her brother. Later, she learned that he had died. He was not the only one.One woman who has been calling for help the entire day after Hamas broke into her house sent a flurry of posts around 17:00. They began with a haunting, whispered voice note: "I need help."Others told her to hang in there. At 18:00, she posted again. "We must be evacuated," she said. These were the last messages from her that the BBC saw on the WhatsApp chat. Her friends say she is either dead or kidnapped.They look back to life before that first message - "God forbid" - to a time where their community was what they call a paradise. They describe a beautiful landscape, a community of mothers and friends that relied on each other and looked out for their neighbours.Surviving residents say they are drawing strength from their broken community - but cannot forget those who have been lost."They are our friends, they are our family, they are everything to us," Golan says. "We know them. They have been part of our lives since we were born and we want them back." The residents had built a community in kibbutz Be'eri over decades. To them, it felt unbreakable. Now, many do not know where to go and what to do. "I don't know if we'll even have a home to go to after this," Dafna says. "We were living in an illusion that we were safe."Translation by Shaina Oppenheimer, Jonathan Beck, Liora Schurr, Jonathan Shamir, and othersDesign and visualisation by Tural Ahmedzade and Joy RoxasVerification by BBC Verify team: Merlyn Thomas, Josh Cheetham, Jake Horton, Paul Myers, Shayan Sardarizadeh and Paul BrownEdited by: Samuel Horti	
13/10/2023 13:47:00	Israel country profile - BBC News	A country on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, Israel is the only state in the world with a majority Jewish population. It has been locked in conflict with the Palestinians and its Arab neighbours over ownership of land considered holy by many Jews, Christians and Muslims since its creation in 1948.The division of the former British Mandate of Palestine and the creation of the State of Israel in the years after the end of World War Two was the culmination of the Zionist movement, whose aim was a homeland for Jews hitherto scattered all over the world. Security concerns over the conflict with the Palestinians are a constant factor in a political environment marked by volatile coalition governments. Israel faces hostility from much of the Arab region, and the US provides crucial diplomatic and military support. Some of the borders remain in dispute. President: Isaac HerzogThe presidency is a largely ceremonial post and notionally above party politics, but individual presidents have used a combination of their personal prestige and the authority of their office to make interventions in national debates.Parliament elected Isaac Herzog to the post in 2021. He is the son of a former president, and led the centre-left Labour Party in 2013-2017. He also served in various government posts between 2005 and 2011.Prime Minister: Benjamin NetanyahuBenjamin Netanyahu, who is chairman of the right-wing Likud party, has been Israel's prime minister since December 2022, leading a government seen as  the most right-wing in Israel's history. He was previously prime minister from 1996 to 1999 and again from 2009 to 2021, making him the longest-serving prime minister in Israel's history.Mr Netanyahu's unrivalled success owes much to the image he has cultivated as the person who can best keep Israel safe from hostile forces in the Middle East.He has taken a tough line towards the Palestinians, putting security concerns at the top of any talk of peace, and long warned of existential danger to Israel from Iran.But hanging over his political achievements is the cloud of a criminal trial for alleged bribery, fraud and breach of trust - charges he fiercely denies.Israel's press and broadcasters are many and varied, reflecting differences in language, political viewpoint and religious outlook. TV is the leading medium and commercial networks top the ratings. Public broadcasting saw a major change in 2017, when the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) ended more than 50 years of operations and was replaced by the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation (IPBC).After the Nazi Holocaust, pressure grew for the international recognition of a Jewish state, and in 1948 Israel declared its independence following a UN vote to partition Palestine. Much of the history of the area since that time has been one of conflict between Israel on one side and Palestinians and Israel's Arab neighbours, on the other. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs were displaced in the fighting in 1948, during which Israel's Arab neighbours came to the aid of the Arab Higher Committee in Palestine. The fighting ended in a series of uneasy armistices. Israel has developed from an agrarian state run along collectivist lines into a hi-tech economy in the past 70 years. It has absorbed Jewish immigrants from Europe, the rest of the Middle East, North America and, most recently, the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia along the way.Its political life has nonetheless been dominated by the conflict with its Arab neighbours, including full-scale regional wars in 1948, 1967 and 1973, and many smaller-scale conflicts including the 1956 invasion of Egypt and the Lebanon wars of 1982 and 2006.  Relations with the Palestinians have been a major factor in foreign and security policy. The Palestinians in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem have lived under Israeli occupation since 1967. The settlements that Israel has built in the West Bank are home to 500,000 people and are deemed to be illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Israel evacuated its settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005 and withdrew its forces, ending almost four decades of military presence inside Gaza. Israel continues to control Gaza's air space and coastal approaches, on the basis of which the international community considers Gaza still to be occupied territory. After the militant Islamic group Hamas reinforced its power in Gaza in June 2007, Israel intensified its economic blockade of the Strip, along with Egypt, with multiple offensives against militants in Gaza in order to halt cross-border rocket attacks.In 1979 Egypt and Israel signed a peace agreement, but it wasn't until the early 1990s, after years of an uprising known as the intifada, that a peace process began with the Palestinians. Despite the handover of Gaza and parts of the West Bank to Palestinian control, a final agreement has yet to be reached. The main stumbling blocks include the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian refugees and their descendants, Jewish settlements, and attacks by Palestinian armed groups. In 2020, increasing regional cooperation between Israel and some Arab League countries led to Israel and the UAE, together with fellow Gulf state Bahrain, signing the US-brokered Abraham Accords on normalising relations.  Beginning in the 2010s, the regional security situation has shifted away from the previous Arab-Israeli conflict towards a proxy conflict between Iran and Israel, alongside direct confrontation Iran during Syria's civil war.	
13/10/2023 12:59:00	UK to deploy Royal Navy ships to Middle East to 'bolster security' - BBC News	The UK will send two Royal Navy ships and surveillance aircraft to the eastern Mediterranean in plans to "bolster security", No 10 says.It comes after six days of violence following the surprise attack on Israel by Hamas. The aircraft will begin patrols on Friday to "track threats to regional stability such as the transfer of weapons to terrorist groups".Three Merlin helicopters and Royal Marines are also being dispatched. The government is also arranging flights for British nationals stranded in Israel. The first plane was expected to leave Tel Aviv on Thursday, but as of Friday morning it had not yet left. A Foreign Office spokesperson said the situation around departure was "fluid", and it was "currently working to ensure the flight can proceed as soon as possible". Speaking in Sweden on Friday, Rishi Sunak said the UK was monitoring the situation in Israel closely, adding "humanitarian concerns and protection of civilians are very important".  The prime minister said Royal Navy assets were being moved to the Mediterranean over the coming week  so they can "provide humanitarian support as required".  On Thursday he spoke to Israel's prime minister to reaffirm the UK's support for Israel following Hamas' appalling terrorist attack", Downing Street said. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps earlier said the Royal Navy vessels were not warships, but "ships that can assist with hospital facilities". He told BBC Breakfast sending the boats was also about "deterring others from getting involved in the region" and "maligning external influence". When asked about Israel's response to the attacks, the defence secretary said "Israel has the right to defend itself" and added that, "unlike Hamas", it was giving warning "that it's coming after Hamas terrorists" which was the right thing to do.Mr Sunak also spoke to Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi on Thursday morning to discuss the importance of opening the Rafah crossing into Gaza to allow for humanitarian access and provide a route for British and other nationals to leave.Speaking on Thursday, he said the UK's military and diplomatic teams across the region would support international partners to "re-establish security and ensure humanitarian aid reaches the thousands of innocent victims of this barbaric attack from Hamas terrorists".Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on Saturday, killing at least 1,300 and taking around 150 hostages to Gaza.More than 1,300 have also been killed in Gaza since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes.	
13/10/2023 12:58:00	How would an Israeli ground assault on Gaza unfold? - BBC News	Israel appears to be preparing for a ground invasion into Gaza. Its military is telling 1.1 million people in the north of the strip to relocate south in the next 24 hours. Meanwhile it is massing tens of thousands of troops, tanks and artillery on the edge of the territory.But sending ground forces into Gaza's densely populated urban areas is an operation fraught with peril.The scope of a potential ground assault is also still not clear - how far would the incursion go and for how long?The choreography necessary for a ground assault has started. Major General Amos Gilead, a veteran of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and previous operations inside Gaza, says the first task for Israel was to create a unity government to get public backing for what happens next. Recent high level diplomatic visits by senior US and European politicians have allowed Israel to shore up international support, though that solidarity could waver the longer this war goes on and as civilian casualties mount. Significant Israeli military casualties in any military operation will also test its own resolve.  As for military preparations, Israel has already massed its forces near the border with Gaza. Some 300,000 reservists have been activated, alongside a standing force of more than 160,000. We talked to some of the recently arrived reservists in the south - their morale appears to be high, and they're ready to fight.Nissim was in Sri Lanka when he first heard the news of the Hamas attack, but took the first plane back to Israel to join his unit. "This is our home. We have to fight for it," he says.Shuki left his sales job straight away. "We would love to have peace," he told me. "Unfortunately, that's not possible. We enjoy life, so we need to fight for the right to live."Israel seems united in the need for action, but the clock is ticking while they await their battle orders. The longer troops wait, the harder it will be to maintain readiness and morale. Israel's warning to Palestinians living in Gaza to flee south is an indication that the next phase of its military operation is imminent. Israel's first task was to secure its own territory and to kill, or capture and interrogate Hamas fighters who crossed the border and killed more than 1,300 people and kidnapped at least 150.Israel's already been conducting intense air strikes targeting Hamas' military hierarchy and infrastructure. Over the past six days its air force has dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Gaza. As a comparison, Nato allies released 7,700 during the entire war in Libya in 2011. More than 1,500 people have been killed in Gaza in the air strikes so far.Plans for the invasion itself will be a closely guarded secret, but Israel has been getting ready for years. It's been training troops in a multi-million dollar urban warfare centre in the south, dubbed mini-Gaza. There they have learnt how to fight through a maze of tightly packed buildings and tunnels, of which Hamas is believed to have built more than 1,000.Yaakov Katz, a former editor of the Jerusalem Post and the author of several books on Israel's military, says the military has been configured to operate for this very purpose in specialist brigades - combining engineers with armoured bulldozers working alongside tanks and infantry.Major General Yaakov Amidror - a former IDF commander and national security advisor - acknowledges that fighting Hamas will be tough. Hamas will have laid booby traps and Improvised Explosive Devices at entrance points and along narrow streets, he says.Israel believes Hamas has around 30,000 troops. Their weapons include automatic rifles, rocket propelled grenades and anti-tank missiles - some of Russian origin like Kornets and Fagots. Hamas also still has large stockpiles of rockets which they've been firing into Israel. Yaakov Katz says Hamas has also been producing its own small drones - including suicide ones. He says Hamas may also have a very limited supply of short-range shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles. What they do not have is armoured vehicles, tanks and artillery - unlike Israel. But the challenge for Israel will be close-quarters fighting in densely populated urban areas.Israel has specialists teams for tunnel warfare, including an engineering unit called Yahalom, and Oketz which specialises in canine combat. Mr Katz says Israeli troops will avoid going into tunnels unless they have to, not least because Hamas will know them better. Instead tunnels will be destroyed by pouring down explosives. The fate of the hostages taken from Israel complicates any ground assault. Maj Gen Gilead was involved in the negotiations which eventually led to the release of an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, who was held by Hamas for five years from 2006 to 2011. He was eventually exchanged for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Maj Gen Gilead says while the military will need to take their fate into consideration, "if we don't do something concrete, we might find ourselves with more challenging problems". But Maj Gen Amidror says the hostages will not prevent any action. "We will fight Hamas to the end and we will have to find those hostages during the operation."Israel's stated goal is to destroy Hamas. Maj Gen Gilead, who served in the IDF for 30 years, says that goes beyond previous Israeli operations inside Gaza, which were "mainly about containment". This time he says "we need to do something far more dramatic". Decisive military action he believes would also deter Israel's other enemies in the region - namely Hezbollah and Iran. Mr Katz believes Israel's goals will be more pragmatic - making sure that Hamas never has the military capability to attack Israel again. He says Israel "doesn't want to re-occupy Gaza, and have to take care of two million people who are hostile to it". However, recent history suggests invasions very rarely go according to plan. Even the world's most advanced militaries can soon get bogged down - look at what happened to the US in Iraq and Afghanistan, and more recently Russia in Ukraine.  A military operation inside Gaza, which is only 25 miles (40 km) long, is not on that scale, but the outcome is far from clear, says Lieutenant General Sir Tom Beckett of the Institute of Strategic Studies."In truth, there are no good options for an Israeli ground offensive in Gaza. No matter how successful the operation proves in defeating Hamas as a military organisation, Hamas's political imperative and the population's support for the resistance will continue. "Israel either reoccupies Gaza to control it or, by withdrawing after an offensive, cedes ground to people for whom the resistance is existence."Are you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

13/10/2023 10:53:00	Missing peace activist Vivian Silver - son awaits news, good or bad - BBC News	Yonatan Ziegen woke early last Saturday morning in his home in Tel Aviv to the sound of alarms, the red alert that all Israelis know intimately. Millions of Israelis and Palestinians were also waking, some hearing explosions as well as sirens, grabbing their phones and starting to follow the news that Hamas had broken into Israel and was on the attack. In Israeli communities along the border wire with Gaza, it soon became clear that this was an emergency like no other. Concrete shelters are never more than a short run away, because of years of living with the threat and reality of rocket attacks from Hamas in Gaza. But when they started hearing shooting, and voices shouting in Arabic, it was different - closer and more deadly.It took Yonatan no time to realise that his mother, Vivian Silver, was in trouble. He knows the border territory well, as he grew up there. His mother, now widowed, was still living in the family home in kibbutz Be'eri, a small community right on the border wire with Gaza. Vivian is one of Israel's best-known campaigners for peace with the Palestinians. She stayed busy in her retirement, continuing her life's work as an activist, holding meetings - Yonatan said - with international supporters of her group, Women Wage Peace, only a few days before the Hamas attacks.    Yonatan rang his mother, and they kept talking as Hamas was moving through the kibbutz. Perhaps trying to cheer them both up, or to stop her thirty-something son from worrying too much, she made light of what was happening, until both realised it was deadly serious and that she was in mortal danger. They switched to WhatsApp so she could stay quiet, hoping Hamas might bypass the house. Yonatan read me their last text messages. Vivien was typing them out from a cupboard in the house where she was hiding. It was time to stop joking. She believed that a massacre was happening. Vivian wrote that she loved him. "She wrote me, 'They're inside the house, it's time to stop joking and say goodbye.'""And I wrote back that 'I love you, Mum. I have no words, I'm with you.'"Then she writes, 'I feel you.' And then that was it, that's the last message."I asked Yonatan what Vivian would be saying now about everything that has happened. "That this is the outcome of war. Of not striving for peace, and this is what happens. "It's very overwhelming but not completely surprising. It's not sustainable to live in a state of war for so long and now it bursts. It bursts."That was around 11:00 on Saturday morning. Neither Yonatan nor his brother has heard anything since, good or bad. Their mother's kibbutz was one of the first targets of Hamas last Saturday, as it's right on the border. Video from a security camera shows them killing a man in a car at the gate at point blank range, as they stormed in and set about killing Israelis. By the time the Israeli army fought its way back into Be'eri, in a fierce fight that did a lot of damage, it was too late to stop the massacre.We travelled to the kibbutz with the army, the only way to get in as it is in what Israel has declared as a closed military area. When we arrived, the smell of decomposition hung over the wreckage, and the body bags of residents were still being brought out of the ruins. In the ambulance they used to move bodies, we met volunteers from an organisation called Zaka - that recovers Jewish dead so they can be buried according to their religion's precepts. On the way to the house where Vivian Silver lived, Moshe Minaker, a veteran volunteer, spoke of the horrors they had seen. "No studio in Hollywood," he said, "can make this movie.""Kids, ladies - they don't just kill, they mutilate, they burn, they sever. It's impossible to describe." The army didn't allow us much time in the street where Vivian Silver lived and brought up her family. She moved here, long before Hamas emerged, for space and country air.  We hoped to find out more about what happened to her. But if there were clues, they were consumed by fire. Vivian's house, and her neighbour's, were gutted. We don't know if she's alive or dead. Her family, like so many others, waits for news, good or bad. The remains of the house, and destruction at the kibbutz, are evidence for most Israelis that it is dangerously wrong for peace activists like Vivian to argue that a century of attempted military solutions to the conflict have failed. The survivors have left the kibbutz. Now it is a staging area as the army waits for the order to enter Gaza. As the soldiers prepare, Israel's government vows that, this time, its forces will destroy Hamas. Are you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

13/10/2023 10:09:00	Kfar Aza kibbutz massacre: Father saves daughter he hadn’t seen for six years - BBC News	Twenty-two-year-old Neta Portal had not spoken to her dad in six years, following her parents' divorce.But when Hamas gunmen broke into her house in the Jewish community of Kfar Aza and shot her six times, she knew he was the only person who could save her life.Shimon Portal, a policeman, was already in a firefight in the nearby city of Sderot when he received the first message from his daughter:But the killing at the kibbutz had already begun.We meet Neta at a hospital in Tel Aviv where doctors have now carefully removed each bullet - five in her left leg and one from her right.She trembles as she recalls slipping in and out of consciousness after the gunmen broke into the residents' safe room and opened fire for the first time:"They were shooting people. They were shooting the kids. And the people were shouting, 'Please no, please no.' I tried to wake myself because I didn't want to die."Sitting next to her in her cubicle is her boyfriend Santiago - or Santi - who struggles to contain his tears.The couple had spent four months in Kfar Aza - a place they describe as the most beautiful on earth.Their interlocking hands whiten as their grip tightens and Neta recalls what happened next."Santi told me, 'Neta, please open the window. Please jump.' I started to open the window and I saw 10 or 15 terrorists."She couldn't believe what she was seeing."They were standing on a car with a big machine gun, smoking cigarettes and laughing like they were on vacation."Neta says she and her boyfriend were scared to jump, but when an attacker threw a grenade into the room, Santi grabbed her and they jumped out of the window together."The terrorists saw us and began to shoot like we were nothing."Neta was hit by even more bullets in the leg and in the hand."Santiago screamed at me: 'Please stand up - start to run. If you don't stand up, we're going to die. We're going to die.'"Santiago managed to carry her to safety two streets away where they hid under a big pile of rubbish, trying to stay as quiet as possible.As Santiago silently used his shirt to try to stem the blood escaping from Neta's legs, she managed to message her dad again.Also in the hospital and sitting by his daughter's side, Shimon Portal tells me what it was like to receive that message."My heart stopped. My brain started to whirl. I was mad."The plain-clothes policeman was already on his way to Kfar Aza, but when he eventually arrived in his unmarked car, gunmen opened fire and he responded.Shimon reversed as bullets peppered his vehicle, and he managed to drive away.He composed himself and then attempted to make a second attempt to rescue his daughter.This time, all was quiet, so he called out for Neta."Suddenly, three children ran to my car because they had heard me shouting in Hebrew. And I opened the door. They started to get in the front, but two terrorists came out of the houses and shot at us."Shimon says he was able to escape with the three girls.He didn't know where his daughter lived, but made his way to the location she sent him.Then he found her. He put Neta in the back of his car, and together with Santiago who'd also been shot in the leg, they drove to the nearest hospital.A reunion of father and daughter in the midst of one of the most gruesome attacks Israel suffered.Now, in the ward, Shimon looks at his daughter, in her hospital gown."My beautiful daughter. I have got her back."But his relief is overwhelmed with anger and sadness."She is a child of peace. She believes only in peace, and she don't understand why they killed small children, why they burned small children in the kibbutz."With Neta visibly tiring and her nurse despatching herself to retrieve more painkillers, I ask Neta how she thinks the Israeli government should respond to the massacre of her community and the other atrocities.At this point, her fluctuating distress turns to deep anger."You want the truth? I don't want the Hamas any more in my life. We need to destroy them one by one. We need to be strong."So what exactly should the army do?"The army needs to be inside Gaza," Neta says. "They need to kill one terrorist after one terrorist after one terrorist. I want peace with all my heart, but I think it's not going to be peace."She takes a breath."I'm sorry I say that - but I just was in my house. And they shot me in my bed."I ask a final question: does she think of the civilians in Gaza who will inevitably be killed in such an intense ground operation?"All that I say is for the jihadis and Hamas. My country doesn't want to hurt civilians. I don't want to hurt civilians. I want them to be saved. I don't think they need to die. Like I don't need to die. They are like me."But we need to fight."Additional reporting by Will Vernon and Matthew GoddardAre you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

13/10/2023 08:01:00	French police break up pro-Palestinian demo after ban - BBC News	Police in the centre of Paris used tear gas and water cannons to break up a pro-Palestinian rally, after the French government banned such demonstrations.Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said those defying it should be arrested as "they are susceptible to disrupt public order.'' Despite the ban, thousands of protesters gathered in Paris, Lille, Bordeaux and other cities on Thursday.President Emmanuel Macron appealed to people not to foment internal division."The shield of unity will protect us from hatred and excesses," he said in a video address.The ban on pro-Palestinian rallies comes as European governments fear a rise in antisemitism triggered by the Israel-Hamas war.Hours later, police made 10 arrests and used water cannon to disperse a 3,000-strong rally at Paris's Place de la République, where demonstrators chanted "Israel murderer" and "Palestine will win" and waved Palestinian flags. Ten people were also arrested at another rally in Lille.Pro-Palestinian groups said the ban risked threatening freedom of expression and pledged to continue demonstrating in support of the Palestinian people. Charlotte Vautier, who attended the rally, told Reuters: "We live in a country of civil law, a country where we have the right to take a stand and to demonstrate. "[It is unfair] to forbid for one side and to authorise for the other."Meanwhile, police in Germany's capital Berlin also banned planned pro-Palestinian demonstrations, citing the risk of antisemitic statements and glorification of violence.Police said around 60 demonstrators complied with an order to leave Potsdamer Platz on Thursday. In his video address, President Macron urged the French people to stay united, saying "let's not add national divisions to international divisions".He described Hamas as "a terrorist organisation that wants the death of the people of Israel".Some 13 French citizens have been confirmed dead in Hamas' attack on Israel on Saturday. President Macron said 17 French nationals were missing and were likely among the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, adding: "France is doing everything it can alongside Israel and our partners to bring them home".Four children are among the missing. Israel, he said, had the right to defend itself by eliminating terrorists, but "has to preserve civilian lives because it's the duty of democracies". "The only response to terrorism is one that is strong but fair," he said. France has a Jewish community of almost 500,000, the largest in Europe. France's Muslim community is also among Europe's largest - an estimated five million.Mr Darmanin told regional representatives on Thursday that Jewish schools and synagogues should be protected by a visible police presence. He told French radio that 100 antisemitic acts had been recorded since Saturday, most involving graffiti showing "swastikas, 'death to Jews,' calls to intifadas against Israel". Some incidents included people being arrested attempting to carry knives into schools and synagogues, he added.French police are already guarding the homes of leading MPs. National Assembly President Yaël Braun-Pivet and MP Meyer Habib, who are both Jewish, have been offered further protection.It has emerged that Ms Braun-Pivet, a member of Mr Macron's Renaissance party, has received death threats. She had parliament lit this week in the colours of the Israeli flag, and called a minute's silence before an Assembly session on Tuesday.Ms Braun-Pivet also announced that Maryam Abu Daqqa, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), would be banned from attending a documentary screening in parliament next month. The militant organisation is recognised as a terrorist organisation by the EU.Meyer Habib represents a constituency for overseas French citizens, which includes Israel and the Palestinian Territories, and is a vocal supporter of Israel. After the Hamas attack he said "we are witnessing the return of pogroms".French politics has been riven by the Hamas attack and its aftermath.While most parties have condemned Saturday's "terrorist attack" and expressed support for Israel's right to respond, the initial response from Jean-Luc Mélenchon's far-left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party was more equivocal. A statement by the party referred to the Hamas attack as "an armed offensive of Palestinian forces", prompting fierce criticism from other parties, including left-wing allies such as the Socialist and Communist parties. Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has declared "zero tolerance" for antisemitism. He told parliament that pro-Palestinian group Samidoun, which was pictured handing out sweets in the Neukölln area of Berlin to celebrate the Hamas attack, would be banned. "We do not tolerate antisemitism," he added.Mr Sholz told MPs in the Bundestag that Israel's security was German state policy. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock is due to travel to Israel on Friday in a gesture of solidarity.According to German authorities, in several towns across the country including Mainz, Braunschweig and Heilbronn, Israeli flags raised in solidarity with the country were torn down and destroyed, sometimes in just a few hours.

13/10/2023 06:37:00	EU opens investigation into X over alleged disinformation - BBC News	The EU is investigating Elon Musk's X over the possible spread of terrorist and violent content, and hate speech, after Hamas' attack on Israel.The investigation, the first under the EU's new tech rules, will also look at the way complaints are handled.X, formerly known as Twitter, said it had removed hundreds of Hamas-affiliated accounts from the platform.TikTok and Meta have also been warned by the EU for not doing enough to tackle disinformation.Social media firms have seen a surge in misinformation about the conflict between Israel and Hamas, including doctored images and mislabelled videos.The EU's industry chief, Thierry Breton, confirmed on Thursday the bloc had sent X a "formal request for information" to determine whether the platform was complying with the Digital Services Act (DSA) - a law designed to protect users of big tech platforms which recently came into effect. X chief executive Linda Yaccarino said earlier on Thursday the platform had removed hundreds of Hamas-affiliated accounts and taken action to remove or label tens of thousands of pieces of content since Saturday's attack, in response to a letter from Mr Breton on Tuesday. Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the EU.At least 150 hostages were taken into Gaza and 1,300 people were killed during Hamas's deadly attacks in Israel at the weekend.Meanwhile, more than 1,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes.The UN's World Food Programme has called the situation in Gaza "dire", with food and water running out during an Israeli siege. Israel says the blockade will not end until its hostages are freed. In his letter to Mr Musk, Mr Breton said "violent and terrorist content" had not been taken down from X, despite warnings.Mr Breton did not give details on the disinformation he was referring to in the letter, but said instances of "fake and manipulated images and facts" were widely reported on the social media platform. In his own response on X, Mr Musk said: "Our policy is that everything is open and transparent, an approach that I know the EU supports."Please list the violations you allude to on X, so that the public can see them."The DSA became law last November but firms were given time to make sure their systems complied. On 25 April, the commission named the very large online platforms - those with over 45 million EU users - that would be subject to the toughest rules, among them X.  The law came into effect four months later in August. Under the tougher rules, larger firms have to assess potential risks they may cause, report that assessment and put in place measures to deal with the problem.Failure to comply with the DSA can result in EU fines of as much as 6% of a company's global turnover, or potentially suspension of the service.X has until 18 October to provide details on how its crisis response protocol is activated and functions, and until 31 October on other issues.Mr Musk dissolved Twitter's Trust and Safety Council shortly after acquiring the company in 2022. Formed in 2016, the volunteer council contained about 100 independent groups who advised on issues such as self-harm, child abuse and hate speech.Meanwhile, a Meta spokesperson told the BBC the company was "working around the clock to keep our platforms safe" and had established a "special operations centre" staffed with experts to monitor the situation.

13/10/2023 01:10:00	Israel targets Hamas’s labyrinth of tunnels under Gaza - BBC News	Israel says it is striking parts of a secret labyrinth of tunnels built underneath the Gaza Strip by Hamas, as it continues to retaliate for the Palestinian Islamist militant group's unprecedented cross-border attack on Saturday."Think of the Gaza Strip as one layer for civilians and then another layer for Hamas. We are trying to get to that second layer that Hamas has built," an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson said in a video on Thursday."These aren't bunkers for Gazan civilians. It's only for Hamas and other terrorists so that they can continue to fire rockets at Israel, to plan operations, to launch terrorists into Israel," they claimed.It is very difficult to assess the size of the network, which Israel has dubbed the "Gaza Metro" because it is believed to stretch beneath a territory that is only 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide. Following a conflict in 2021, the IDF said it had destroyed more than 100km of tunnels in air strikes. Hamas meanwhile claimed that its tunnels stretched 500km and that only 5% were hit. To put those figures into perspective, the London Underground is 400km long and is mostly above ground.Tunnel construction began in Gaza before Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005.But it was ramped up after Hamas took control of the Strip two years later, which prompted Israel and Egypt to begin restricting the movement of goods and people in and out for security reasons.At its peak, almost 2,500 tunnels running underneath the Egyptian border were used to smuggle in commercial goods, fuel and weapons by Hamas and other militant groups. The smuggling became less important to Gaza after 2010, when Israel began allowing more goods to be imported through its crossings. Egypt later shut the smuggling down by flooding or destroying the tunnels.Hamas and other factions also started digging tunnels to attack Israeli forces.In 2006, militants used one underneath the border with Israel to kill two Israeli soldiers and seize a third, Gilad Shalit, who they held captive for five years.In 2013, the IDF discovered a 1.6km-long, 18m-deep tunnel lined with a concrete roof and walls leading from the Strip to land near an Israeli kibbutz after residents heard strange sounds. The following year, Israel cited the need to eradicate the threat of attacks by militants using such "terror tunnels" under the frontier for a major air and ground offensive in Gaza.The IDF said its forces destroyed more than 30 tunnels during the war. But a group of militants were also able to use one to mount an attack in which four Israeli soldiers were killed."The cross-border tunnels tend to be rudimentary, meaning they have barely any fortification. They are dug for a one-time purpose - invading Israeli territory," says Dr Daphné Richemond-Barak, an expert on underground warfare who teaches at Reichman University in Israel. "The tunnels inside Gaza are different because Hamas is using them on a regular basis. They are probably more comfortable to be in for longer periods of time. They are definitely equipped for a longer, sustained presence.""The leaders are hiding there, they have command-and-control centres, they use them for transport and lines of communication. They are equipped with electricity, lighting and rail tracks. You can move around more and stand."She says Hamas appears to have "perfected the art" of tunnel building and warfare in recent years, having learned a huge amount by observing the tactics of Syrian rebel fighters in Aleppo and jihadist militants from the Islamic State (IS) group in Mosul.The tunnels inside Gaza are believed to be as much as 30m (100ft) below the surface and have entrances located on the bottom floors of houses, mosques, schools and other public buildings to allow militants to evade detection. Building the network has also come at a cost to the local population. The IDF has accused Hamas of diverting millions of dollars given to Gaza in aid to pay for the tunnels as well as tens of thousands of tons of cement intended for rebuilding homes destroyed in previous wars.It is possible that a cross-border tunnel was used by Hamas militants during last weekend's attacks in Israel, in which at least 1,300 people were killed, most of them civilians, and more than 150 others were taken as hostages. There were reports that a tunnel exit was discovered near the kibbutz of Kfar Aza, where dozens of civilians were massacred.If that is confirmed, the tunnel would have been built beneath the underground concrete barrier studded with sophisticated anti-tunnel detection sensors which Israel finished installing at the end of 2021. Dr Richemond-Barak says it would be a shock, but stresses that no tunnel detection system is fool-proof. "This is why tunnels have been used for time immemorial in war, because is there no way to prevent them."She also cautions that it is unrealistic for the Israeli establishment and general public to believe it will be possible for the IDF to destroy Hamas's entire network of tunnels in Gaza, as hundreds of thousands of troops mass nearby for a possible ground operation."There will be parts of the network where civilians, for whatever reason, will not evacuate... Some parts of the underground network are unknown. And for some of them the collateral damage will be too high."Destroying the tunnels will also lead to a significant loss of life - among Israeli forces on the ground, Palestinian civilians and the hostages, she warns. More than 1,500 Palestinians in Gaza, many of them civilians, have already been killed in retaliatory Israeli air strikes since Saturday."Hamas is very good at using human shields. Once a strike is imminent and they know it, they will put innocent civilians on top of buildings. That has forced Israel to cancel strikes many times," Dr Richemond-Barak says."Having mastered the technique, Hamas could easily use it in the context of the tunnels and simply put Israeli, American and other hostages inside them."During the 2021 conflict, a series of devastating air strikes in Gaza City brought three residential buildings crashing to the ground, killing 42 people. The IDF said it targeted underground tunnels, but that when they collapsed the building's foundations collapsed too.The tunnel network will also negate the advantages that the IDF has in terms of technology and intelligence, magnify the difficulties of urban warfare, and pose a lethal threat to Israeli troops, according to Dr Richemond-Barak."First of all, Hamas has had plenty of time to booby-trap the entire network," she says. "They could just let the soldiers enter into the tunnel network and then eventually blow the whole thing up.""They could kidnap [the soldiers in surprise attacks]. And then you have all the other risks - running out of oxygen, fighting the enemy in one-on-one combat, and rescuing wounded soldiers becomes virtually impossible."She adds: "Even if you don't go inside the tunnel, to secure an area where you suspect that tunnels might be present is very different from just securing an area in general. Here, you have to secure something that is invisible."The Israeli forces will, however, have some ways to mitigate the risks.According to Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group security consultancy, these might include sending drones and unmanned vehicles into tunnels to map them and identify booby traps before soldiers clear them.  Warplanes could also drop "bunker busting" bombs, which penetrate deep into the ground before detonating. However, they would pose a risk of collateral damage due to the dense urban terrain.	
12/10/2023 21:58:00	UK arranges flights for Britons stranded in Israel - BBC News	The UK is arranging flights to get stranded British nationals out of Israel, the Foreign Office has said.The first plane was expected to leave Tel Aviv on Thursday, with more flights planned "in the coming days, subject to security". Those eligible to leave will be contacted directly and British nationals should not go to airports unless they are called to.A team of diplomats has been sent to Israel to help people flying to the UK.The Foreign Office said it is "working to ensure the flight can proceed as soon as possible."The UK government said earlier this week it would not arrange evacuation flights because commercial routes were still available.But British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, EasyJet, Ryanair, Wizz Air, Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates have all suspended flights in recent days.In other UK developments: The government-arranged flights will be chartered by the Foreign Office but are commercial services. Each passenger will be charged £300.A statement said British nationals, including dual nationals, and dependants if travelling with a British national normally resident in the UK, would be invited to take up seats.All seats for the first flight have been allocated, a British official at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport told the BBC. Those who will be travelling on the flight have been notified by text message. A number of countries have already completed flights to get people home from Israel, including Canada, France, Italy and Poland. Most airlines stopped flying direct between Israel and the UK earlier this week, and Virgin Atlantic and British Airways pulled their last remaining daily service on Thursday after a BA flight was forced to turn back over security concerns.It has left people struggling to find tickets for the few remaining commercial routes operating.Laurence Julius, 67, is in Tel Aviv with his wife Lyn, where they had been visiting family.  They have registered with the Foreign Office, but they have not been contacted about a flight.  Mr Julius is eager to return to London as he is the primary carer of his 92-year-old mother, who has chronic health issues. His children in London have stepped in to help care for her while he is away. "It's not optimal that we are stuck here, to put it mildly," he said. After a BA flight was cancelled, he said the airline "tried to book us on every possible route" but all flights were "absolutely full". The Foreign Office confirmed on Thursday that families of British diplomats were leaving Israel as a "precautionary measure".It stressed the embassy in Israel continued to operate, and British nationals could seek consular assistance.A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: "The FCDO continues to advise against all travel to parts of Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and to advise against all but essential travel to all other parts."Meanwhile, Downing Street said the UK will send surveillance aircraft and two Royal Navy ships to the eastern Mediterranean in a military package "to support Israel".Under the plans, a Royal Navy task group will be moved to the area next week to support humanitarian efforts.At least 100 "reservists and active duty soldiers" are understood to have travelled from the UK to Israel to serve in the Israel Defence Forces, the Israeli embassy in the UK said.The Israeli government has indicated it is preparing to launch a ground military operation inside Gaza in response to Hamas's deadly attacks at the weekend that have left 1,300 dead.Authorities say more than 1,300 have also been killed in Gaza since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes, with 338,000 displaced.In a call with Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called for the country to keep its crossing with Gaza open for "humanitarian and consular reasons", Downing Street said.	
12/10/2023 20:50:00	US $6bn deal with Iran under scrutiny in wake of Hamas attack on Israel - BBC News	The US says Iran has not accessed money agreed in a prisoner swap as the White House faces renewed criticism over the deal amid claims Tehran instigated a Hamas attack on Israel last weekend.Washington has a "quiet understanding" with go-between Qatar not to free up any of $6bn (£.4.9bn) from the pact, the BBC's US partner CBS reports.Iran's mission to the UN said the US cannot renege on the agreement.The US has said it has no evidence of a direct Iran link to the Hamas assault.  The $6bn of Iranian oil funds held in South Korea were unfrozen in September as part of a deal that saw five US-Iranian citizens freed from captivity.US President Joe Biden's officials have pushed back strongly against Republican criticism that the fund empowered Iran's support for Hamas.  On Thursday morning, Deputy US Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told House of Representatives Democrats behind closed doors that the money "isn't going anywhere anytime soon".But later in the day, White House spokesman John Kirby would not confirm reports that the funds had been frozen."What I can tell you," he said, "is none of it has been accessed and we are watching every dime as you would expect. "We were watching it very, very closely."Neither would US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken confirm the money had been frozen as he visited Tel Aviv on Thursday.He instead listed the "facts" about the account in a weary voice when asked about the matter by journalists.America's top diplomat said it was Iran's money from oil sales, that it was held in Qatar and that it was only for food and medicine and that the US has to approve every transaction.  It is a complicated mechanism that has not yet been activated.  Any such freeze would be a provocative one at a time when the US is trying to prevent Iran and the militant groups it backs from joining the Israel-Hamas conflict.  Analysts warn such a move could embolden hardliners in Iran.  US officials would also probably be concerned a freeze of the fund would lead Iran to arrest more US-Iranian citizens.  National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday that Iran had played a role in the attack by funding the military wing of Hamas over the years.But US officials have also said they cannot corroborate reports of direct involvement in the attack by Iran, which is Israel's arch-enemy.President Biden has been under pressure from within his party to stop the funds going to Iran. Democratic senators who are facing re-election next year have joined Republican calls for the US president to effectively break the deal.But Iran's mission to the United Nations said in a statement reported by the Washington Post: "The senators in question and the US government are all acutely aware that they can NOT renege on the agreement. "The money rightfully belongs to the people of Iran, earmarked for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to facilitate the acquisition of all essential and non-sanctioned requisites for the Iranians."	
12/10/2023 20:26:00	Bodies line corridors as Gaza hospital warns it's at breaking point - BBC News	Gaza City's main hospital, Al Shifa, is at full capacity. The hallways and courtyards are filled with hundreds of bodies, as the morgue's refrigerators cannot hold them all. More bodies still lie outside.Inside, hundreds of seriously injured people fill the hallways as staff work under immense pressure, knowing that all services might soon grind to a halt if its back-up generators stop working. Women and children are among the wounded. This could lead to a serious catastrophe. At the hospital, we see a young girl who has been brought in screaming from intense pain and shock. She calls out to doctors to treat her and to get rid of her pain. Her home was unexpectedly shelled by Israeli forces, and a number of her relatives were killed. But doctors are racing against time, and focus on giving priority to those who have been most seriously injured. For others it is too late.One woman sits next to the bodies of some of her relatives, who also died in a fierce Israeli bombardment which targeted a densely populated neighbourhood of Gaza. Surviving family members are arriving one by one."We were sleeping and they bombarded our house like everyone else," she says. "They hit our house while we were sleeping. We didn't have any fighters [in our building]. The building is full of civilians - 120 people live there." Another woman on a stretcher tell us: "They postponed my operation, they said other people were more of a priority… you can wait a bit. What can I do? [There are] so many people injured here." The head of the hospital, Dr Muhammad Abu Salmia, tells the BBC of the consequences if al-Shifa is forced to stop operating: "The hospital cannot function without electricity."More than 120 people are intubated in the ICU, neonatal and other wards; [if this happens,] all departments and services across the hospital will collapse, and we will no longer be able to treat patients." As we report from the hospital, we discover that dozens of our own neighbours, relatives and friends are among those injured and killed. We have to stop working as we process the shock of the story coming so close to us.Cameraman Mahmoud al-Ajrami is overwhelmed and tears run down his face when he discovers a friend has been brought to the hospital after surviving serious injuries, and that most of the man's relatives have been killed. The Palestinian ministry of health says it is working under immense pressure, conscious of the risk that hospitals in Gaza will soon be unable to function because of the power shutdown.	
12/10/2023 19:54:00	Syria says Damascus and Aleppo airports hit by Israeli missiles - BBC News	Syrian state media says Israeli forces have hit the country's two main international airports with missiles, putting them out of action.State media said runways had been damaged at both Damascus and Aleppo airports and flights would be diverted to Latakia, a city in north-west Syria.Israel has not commented on the strike. It has previously attacked targets in war-torn Syria, linked to Iran.Iran's foreign minister was planning to fly to Syria on Friday.Syria's Damascus and Aleppo airports not only handle civil aviation but also host military bases, which are reportedly transit points for Iranian arms sent to Hezbollah - a militant group which is powerful in both Syria and Lebanon.An unnamed military source quoted by Syrian state media said "simultaneous" Israeli strikes had "damaged landing strips in the two airports, putting them out of service". The source called it a "desperate"Israeli attempt to divert attention from the Gaza conflict.Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian - who was due to visit Syria as part of a tour of the region in the coming days - arrived in Iraq on Thursday and is also expected to visit Lebanon.The minister's tour is seen as an effort by Tehran to rally regional support for Hamas - which rules the Gaza Strip. The Iranian government, fiercely hostile to Israel, celebrated Hamas' surprise attack on Saturday, in which 1,300 Israelis were killed.Iran has condemned Israel's retaliatory bombing of Gaza, which has destroyed whole neighbourhoods. Palestinian officials say more than 1,400 people have been killed in the bombings.Since the Hamas assault there have been some cross-border exchanges of fire between Israel and militants in southern Lebanon and Syria. Israel has sent reinforcements to the north to thwart any Hezbollah attack.Iran, Hezbollah and Russia are key allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his long-running battle against opposition groups and the so-called Islamic State (IS).Russia's foreign ministry condemned the Israeli missile strike on Syria, saying "the lives of innocent people and the safety of international air traffic were exposed to a real threat".It said that in light of the "sharp deterioration" in Israel's conflict with the Palestinians, "such forceful actions are fraught with extremely dangerous consequences, since they can provoke an armed escalation throughout the entire region". 	
12/10/2023 19:40:00	Blinken says US will 'always be there' for Israel - BBC News	US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has promised unwavering support for Israel in its fight against what he described as a Hamas "reign of terror". Speaking with PM Benjamin Netanyahu about last weekend's deadly attack by Gaza-based militants, Mr Blinken said Israel will "never, ever" be alone. He also urged Israel to avoid harming civilians in the conflict. At least 1,300 Israelis were killed, and over 1,400 Palestinians have died in air strikes on Gaza.Twenty-seven US citizens are known to have died in Israel and 14 are missing, feared abducted. On Thursday, the State Department announced that it would begin arranging charter flights for US citizens still in Israel who hope to leave beginning on 13 October. These flights are expected to be augmented in the "coming days".Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organisation by the US and European Union, took up to 150 people hostage when its gunmen stormed through the Gaza security barrier on Saturday in a co-ordinated land, air and sea attack. It was the deadliest assault by Palestinian militants in Israel's 75-year history.America's top diplomat met Mr Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Thursday, where he was thanked for the US support. During a joint press conference, Mr Blinken told Israelis "you may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself, but as long as America exists you will never, ever have to".He also stressed the importance of taking "every possible precaution" to avoid harming more civilians as fighting continues. The US mourned "the loss of every innocent life", he added.Concerns have been mounting for Gaza's civilian population amid dwindling supplies and expectations of an Israeli ground offensive. Mr Blinken also condemned the deaths caused by the "heinous attacks" of Hamas. Mr Netanyahu said that Mr Blinken's visit to Israel was a "tangible example of America's unequivocal support of Israel"."President Biden was absolutely correct in calling this sheer evil," he added, referring to the unprecedented attack on the Jewish Sabbath.Mr Blinken also met Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Thursday.On Friday he will meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Jordan's King Abdullah in the Jordanian capital Amman.US President Joe Biden on Wednesday said he had made it clear to Mr Netanyahu that Israel "must operate by the rules of war" in its response to Hamas' attacks.He has also said Israel has a duty to respond to an "act of sheer evil".Israel has said a total blockade - including on food, fuel and other essentials - imposed on Gaza since the attacks would not be lifted until hostages are freed.Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas and has launched a bombing campaign on the enclave of 2.3 million people.Reuters quoted an unnamed US state department official as saying there were up to 600 Americans in Gaza, some of whom wanted to leave.Aid agencies, meanwhile, have been calling for humanitarian corridors to ease the suffering of civilians in Gaza.	
12/10/2023 19:00:00	British couple trapped in Gaza with no UK help, says son - BBC News	A British-Palestinian couple trapped in Gaza amid Israel's siege have had little help from the UK government, their son has said.Naila and Talal El-Deeb, from London, were visiting relatives in Gaza when the violence erupted on Saturday with Hamas's attack on Israel.Mo El-Deeb said his parents' attempt to flee through Egypt was halted when an Israeli jet struck near the border.The UK government said it was working to keep the Rafah border open.Mo, from Marylebone in central London, told BBC News both his parents were originally from Gaza and his dad went back to visit family a couple of months ago, with Mrs El-Deeb joining him two weeks ago.The 30-year-old said: "Now they're stuck. There's no way for them to get out - we've tried every angle and there's no real solution for them to leave Gaza."Mrs El-Deeb has suffered a stroke since arriving in the territory, her son said. "They were instructed to go to the Egyptian border as their names were on some sort of list," Mo said. "When they got to the border there was about 5,000 people waiting in a queue."Within five minutes of them being there, there had been a strike on a building opposite the border."They were then evacuated and told the border would be closed for the "foreseeable future", Mo said.He added that since then his parents had "been sheltering in the dark with no electricity". He said the British Embassy told them to follow the advice published on the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office's (FCDO) website.The current advice states: "If you are a British national in Gaza and want to leave, check the status of the Rafah crossing into Egypt before you travel. Movement to the Rafah crossing and beyond is at your own risk."British citizens are also encouraged to register with the FCDO.On Thursday, the government announced evacuation flights for British nationals stranded in Israel, but those in Gaza are unable to cross the Israel border."I got sent a voice note this morning (Thursday) and you could hear bombs in the background," Mo told the BBC."My parents are waiting to hear instructions from the Foreign Office [but] nobody seems to know."Another Londoner worried about family in Gaza is Saleem Lubbad, a Palestinian academic who has lived in the capital for over 10 years.He told the BBC his family was under constant threat from Israeli airstrikes."The whole place is being carpet-bombed," the 33-year-old said. "We lost close family members - three cousins and an uncle. From my mother's side we lost 14 people, an entire family was wiped out."He said members of his family, including his two brothers with their children, had been displaced multiple times due to the bombing from Israeli military jets."There's literally nowhere to go," he added. "I am desperately anxious over the fate of my siblings," Mr Lubbad told the BBC. "At any minute we expect to learn that one, if not all of them, have been killed."A Foreign Office spokesperson said: "The safety of all British nationals continues to be our utmost priority.

Kidney dialysis stops, and X-rays can't be taken," said Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC's director for the region."Without electricity, hospitals risk turning into morgues."He added that hospitals were still running on generators - but fuel would only last "for a few hours".Hospitals in Gaza are seeing long queues outside, with injured people waiting for emergency rooms. They are running out of essential medical equipment and appealing for blood donations. Children - some seriously wounded - are lying in hospital beds crying, waiting for treatment.The largest public healthcare complex in the Gaza Strip, the Al-Shifa Hospital, is "overloaded", a doctor there told the BBC."We can hardly manage dealing with the patients", said Dr Mohamad Matar.Doctors are now having to make tough decisions on who to operate on, as fuel supplies run critically low. Doctors say only life-saving treatment is being carried out in many cases.The absence of humanitarian corridors is resulting in unprecedented problems for hospitals. In previous wars, the ICRC and UN were able to secure corridors to deliver aid but Israel has not yet allowed for this.The main option being considered, the ICRC says, is the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt.Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said on Thursday that his government was working with Egypt to open corridors for humanitarian aid."Closing all access to the Gaza Strip and preventing aid is a mass killing of our people," he said.Egypt says it has been trying to arrange aid deliveries through the Rafah crossing, but this has been made difficult by Israeli bombardment in the territory.Those air strikes have meant people are also filling up hospitals to shelter, believing they are safer there than other parts of Gaza.Dr Justin Dalby, who has been working in Gaza for six months with the humanitarian charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) told the BBC that the number of injured was "just absolutely immense". He said there was "constant violence" as "destruction continues everywhere ... day or night"."If you are taking out the electricity supply of a hospital, it means that lights go off. Monitoring equipment, oxygen delivery, mechanical ventilators, operating theatres and surgical equipment that require electricity will no longer be able to function," he said. Hamas took about 150 Israeli hostages into Gaza during its deadly attacks on southern Israel at the weekend that killed at least 1,300 people.Israel's Energy Minister Israel Katz said "no electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter" until the "abductees" are free.Israel stopped supplies to the Gaza Strip after the Hamas attacks on Saturday.More than 1,300 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its air strikes on Saturday, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. A further 5,339 have been injured.Meanwhile, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees says more than 338,000 people have been displaced, with most sheltering in hospitals and UN schools."The human misery caused by this escalation is abhorrent, and I implore the sides to reduce the suffering of civilians," Mr Carboni of the ICRC said. 	
12/10/2023 17:14:00	Ex-soldier fought off Hamas and saved kibbutz neighbours - BBC News	One of the first Israeli settlements to come under attack when Hamas militants surged into Israel early on Saturday morning was the Nir Am kibbutz, where local people put up a fierce defence and drove the attackers away. "I took my pistol, my clothes, my bulletproof vest and the other thing was cigarettes," Adam says, calmly recounting being jolted from his bed by the sound of gunfire at 06:30 on Saturday. "We started to kill everyone who came to the fence." He's been labelled the hero of Nir Am, the saviour of his kibbutz, a community of around 400 people living just 2km (1.2 miles) from Gaza.  "I took the walkie-talkie and I said this line again and again: 'No-one will enter Nir Am, no-one will enter Nir Am.'" Adam is 46, ex-special-forces, so we can't show his face or use his full name. His head is shaved, a boxer, not the biggest man but you wouldn't mess with him. It's clear he can handle himself. He was joined by other men from the kibbutz, he says. "Civilians who don't know how to fight but have got a lot of heart. Two or three with special forces experience but the others… just regular men, they work in IT. Regular men, but very, very special." Together they fought for between three and five hours - Adam isn't exactly sure. Then came a lull. "We thought it was all good but then came the second wave, between eight to 10 terrorists with machine guns, with rocket-propelled grenades… They were close, 10m to 15m. I ran towards them and stood and shot and killed… a bullet to the head." What was he feeling in the heat of this gun battle? "My mind is regular I'm a warrior, I'm a fighter, this is what I'm built for." And he was clear what was at stake. The people of Nir Am would have been slaughtered, he says, just as they were at some other kibbutzim, communities organised as collectives, often farms."They will run to the houses and kill the women and the kids. That kept us fighting, killing. We didn't let anybody get into the kibbutz. Nobody got hurt." Now Nir Am residents are living in a Tel Aviv hotel. They don't know when they'll be able to return. Adam fears some will be too afraid. He's thankful for the hospitality. "It's very warming, it's like another house," he says. "And all of Israel has sent us clothes and food." But even here, the evacuees aren't entirely safe. Our conversation is interrupted by sirens warning of another rocket attack. Adam calmly guides us to the shelter, where families are huddled, some of the children crying. "It's nothing for us, we live in the south. It's a regular thing for us," Adam says. Adam is critical of Israel's government, particularly the failure of the security services to predict and prepare for the attack. "It's our leadership. They're under test now. Our leadership don't deserve us," he says. Some 1,300 people died in the unprecedented Hamas attack on Israel, and at least 150 people were taken as hostages. Israel has retaliated with air strikes on Gaza, which have also killed 1,300. It has also closed the border preventing the entry of fuel and food. And what about the future? Adam says he thinks most people in Gaza are good people who want a normal life, but he wants overwhelming military action to deal with Hamas. "We can't have the same solution, we need something much, much stronger," he says.But he says he doesn't want to see Israeli troops enter Gaza. "They (Hamas) want us to do that because they've got traps in there. This would be wrong."Only one resident of Nir Am was killed, a young man who was at the music festival stormed by Hamas. Adam and his civilian force kept the kibbutz safe. 	
12/10/2023 16:20:00	Hamas hostages: Kidnapped mum planned to celebrate birthday in UK - BBC News	A Briton whose mother was kidnapped by Hamas says he should have been celebrating her birthday with her this week. Noam Sagi's mother, Ada Sagi, was taken hostage in the kibbutz of Nir Oz, near Israel's border with Gaza. "These are peace-loving people who fought all their lives for good neighbouring relationships," he said.Hamas launched an assault on Israel last week, killing at least 1,300 and taking around 150 hostages to Gaza.Israel has carried out waves of air and artillery strikes on Gaza in response, in which more than 1,300 Palestinians have also been killed.Speaking at a press conference in London, Mr Sagi said he was in a "luxury position" to "be able to sit here and worry" about his mother.He described the situation as "heartbreaking", adding that he was working to ensure that all civilians being held were released. "They need to be back home now - I'm talking about civilians, especially every kid under 18, every elder person over 65," he said. Mr Sagi was speaking alongside Sharone Lifschitz, whose parents were also kidnapped from Nir Oz. She said her community had faced an "act of such barbarity". "These are the children that we all know - the children of our friends," she said of those taken, adding that she wanted to act as a voice for the hostages."This is horrific - there are people that are there counting the bodies, supporting the survivors."She said her priority was to ensure all civilians taken hostage would be returned safely. Both Mr Sagi and Ms Lifschitz grew up in Nir Oz, and described its strong sense of community. "I think there will be time to bury the dead - I think there will be time to decide what to do with the place," Ms Lifschitz said of Nir Oz, which is about 400m from the Gaza border, adding that she had spoken to her brother who "did not see a way for us to go back there". "They have eradicated the place," she said. "We have to fight for those we can still save - the place is gone, the dead are dead." Hamas says it has hidden people it has kidnapped in "safe places and tunnels" within Gaza, and has threatened to kill the hostages if civilian homes are bombed by Israel without warning. Energy minister Israel Katz has warned no "electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter" Gaza until the "abductees" are free. On Wednesday, the only power station in Gaza ran out of fuel, meaning the territory is relying on generators. Hospitals in Gaza risk turning into morgues without electricity, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has warned. Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.	
12/10/2023 14:18:00	Israel-Gaza attacks: Four arrests made at Manchester vigil - BBC News	Four arrests were made as hundreds of people gathered in Manchester for a vigil after the Hamas attacks.The militant group launched an unprecedented assault on Saturday, killing hundreds of people and taking dozens of hostages.Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) Chief Constable Stephen Watson said the vigil on Wednesday "passed off peacefully and without significant incident".Police said four people were arrested on suspicion of breaching the peace.One of the suspects was de-arrested following further investigation, the force added. In a social media post that was later deleted, the force said the arrests were "not for supporting Palestine", adding that people had a "right to express their support for both Israel and Palestine"."The force draws a clear distinction between support for Palestine and support for the proscribed terrorist organisation Hamas," it said.The force has been asked why the post was deleted. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham and council leader Bev Craig were among those speaking at the event at St Peter's Square.Mr Watson said: "Last night's vigil to honour and remember the victims of the deeply distressing and abhorrent Hamas terrorist attack on Israel passed off peacefully, and without significant incident.  "I thank our communities for their proactive and calm approach to standing together in solidarity and thank my officers for delivering a professional policing operation."He added that there was "no place for antisemitic hate crime in Greater Manchester"Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?
